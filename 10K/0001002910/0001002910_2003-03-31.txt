ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

     Ameren Corporation (Ameren) was incorporated in Missouri on August 7, 1995.
On December 31, 1997,  following the receipt of all required  approvals,  CIPSCO
Incorporated  (CIPSCO) and Union Electric  Company combined with the result that
the common  shareholders of CIPSCO and Union Electric  Company became the common
shareholders of Ameren,  and Ameren became the owner of 100% of the common stock
of Union  Electric  Company and the operating  subsidiaries  of CIPSCO:  Central
Illinois Public Service Company and CIPSCO Investment  Company. We completed our
acquisition  of CILCORP  Inc.  (CILCORP)  on January  31, 2003 and of AES Medina
Valley Cogen (No. 4) LLC on February 4, 2003 from The AES Corporation (AES). See
CILCORP Acquisition below for further information.

     When we  refer  to  Ameren,  our,  we or us,  we are  referring  to  Ameren
Corporation on a consolidated basis. In certain circumstances,  our subsidiaries
are  specifically  referenced  in order to  distinguish  among  their  different
business activities.

     Ameren is a public utility holding  company  registered with the Securities
and Exchange  Commission  (SEC) under the Public Utility  Holding Company Act of
1935 (PUHCA),  as amended,  and does not own or operate any  significant  assets
other than the stock of its subsidiaries.  Ameren is headquartered in St. Louis,
Missouri.  Dividends on Ameren's common stock are dependent on  distributions to
be made to it by its subsidiaries. Our primary subsidiaries are as follows:

o    Union  Electric   Company,   which  operates  a   rate-regulated   electric
     generation,  transmission and distribution  business,  and a rate-regulated
     natural gas  distribution  business in Missouri  and  Illinois as AmerenUE.
     AmerenUE was  incorporated in Missouri in 1922 and is successor to a number
     of companies,  the oldest of which was organized in 1881. It is the largest
     electric  utility in the State of Missouri  and  supplies  electric and gas
     service in parts of central and eastern  Missouri and west central Illinois
     having  an  estimated   population  of  2.6  million   within  an  area  of
     approximately  24,500 square  miles,  including the greater St. Louis area.
     AmerenUE  supplies  electric service to approximately 1.2 million customers
     and natural gas service to approximately 130,000 customers.
o    Central  Illinois Public Service  Company,  which operates a rate-regulated
     electric  and  natural  gas  transmission  and  distribution   business  in
     Illinois,  as AmerenCIPS.  AmerenCIPS was incorporated in Illinois in 1902.
     It supplies  electric  and gas  utility  service to portions of central and
     southern Illinois having an estimated  population of 820,000 within an area
     of approximately 20,000 square miles.  AmerenCIPS supplies electric service
     to approximately 325,000 customers and natural gas service to approximately
     170,000 customers.
o    Central  Illinois  Light  Company,  a  subsidiary  of CILCORP  Inc.,  which
     operates  a  rate-regulated  transmission  and  distribution  business,  an
     electric generation business, and a rate-regulated natural gas distribution
     business  in Illinois  as  AmerenCILCO.  AmerenCILCO  was  incorporated  in
     Illinois in 1913. It supplies  electric and gas utility service to portions
     of central and east central Illinois in an area of approximately  3,700 and
     4,500 square miles, respectively.  AmerenCILCO supplies electric service to
     about 200,000 customers and natural gas service to about 205,000 customers.
     See CILCORP Acquisition below for further information.
o    AmerenEnergy  Resources Company (Resources Company),  which consists of non
     rate-regulated  operations.  Subsidiaries include  AmerenEnergy  Generating
     Company  (Generating  Company)  that operates non  rate-regulated  electric
     generation  in  Missouri  and  Illinois,   AmerenEnergy  Marketing  Company
     (Marketing  Company),  which  markets  power  for  periods  over one  year,
     AmerenEnergy  Fuels and Services  Company,  which procures fuel and manages
     the related  risks for our  affiliated  companies and  AmerenEnergy  Medina
     Valley Cogen (No. 4), LLC which  indirectly  owns a 40 megawatt,  gas-fired
     electric   generation   plant.  On  February  4,  2003,  we  completed  our
     acquisition of AES Medina Valley Cogen (No. 4), LLC from AES and renamed it
     AmerenEnergy  Medina  Valley Cogen (No.  4), LLC.  See CILCORP  Acquisition
     below for  further  information.  Generating  Company was  incorporated  in
     Illinois in March 2000 in conjunction  with the Illinois  Electric  Service
     Customer  Choice  and Rate  Relief  Law of 1997 (the  Illinois  Law).  This
     Illinois Law provides for electric  utility  restructuring  and  introduces
     competition  into  the  retail  supply  of  electric  energy  in  Illinois.
     Generating  Company  commenced  operations  on May 1, 2000 when  AmerenCIPS
     transferred  to Generating  Company all of the  following:  its  generating
     assets,  consisting of the generating facilities described below under Item
     2. Properties;  all related fuel, supply,  transportation,  maintenance and
     labor  agreements;  approximately  45% of AmerenCIPS'  employees;  and some
     other related rights, assets and liabilities.

o    AmerenEnergy,  Inc.  (AmerenEnergy)  which serves as a power  marketing and
     risk  management  agent for our affiliated  companies for  transactions  of
     primarily less than one year.
o    Electric  Energy,  Inc.  (EEI),  which  operates  electric  generation  and
     transmission  facilities in Illinois. EEI supplies electric power primarily
     to a uranium enrichment plant located in Paducah,  Kentucky.  We have a 60%
     ownership  interest  in EEI  and  consolidate  it for  financial  reporting
     purposes.
o    Ameren Services  Company (Ameren  Services),  which provides shared support
     services to us and our subsidiaries.

     For  additional  information  regarding the  acquisition of CILCORP and AES
Medina  Valley  Cogen (No.  4), LLC,  see Recent  Developments  in  Management's
Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of  Operations  and
Notes 1 and 18 to our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of the  2002  Annual
Report pages incorporated herein by reference under Items 7 and 8.

     For the year  2002,  91.7%  (2001 - 90.9%;  2000 - 91.5%) of our  operating
revenues were derived from the sale of electric energy,  8.2% (2001 - 8.9%; 2000
- 8.4%) came from the sale of natural gas,  and 0.1% (2001 - 0.2%;  2000 - 0.1%)
came from other sources.

     We employed  7,422  employees at December 31, 2002.  For  information  on a
voluntary  retirement  program offered in December 2002 and on labor  agreements
and  other  labor  matters,  see  Note  9 and  Note  14,  respectively,  to  our
Consolidated  Financial  Statements of the 2002 Annual Report pages incorporated
herein by reference under Item 8.

CILCORP Acquisition

     On January 31,  2003,  after  receipt of the  necessary  regulatory  agency
approvals   and   clearance   from  the   Department   of   Justice   under  the
Hart-Scott-Rodino  Antitrust  Improvements  Act, we completed our acquisition of
all of the outstanding  common stock of CILCORP from AES.  CILCORP is the parent
company of Peoria, Illinois-based Central Illinois Light Company, which operated
as CILCO. With the acquisition, CILCO became an Ameren subsidiary, but remains a
separate utility company, operating as AmerenCILCO. On February 4, 2003, we also
completed  our  acquisition  of AES Medina  Valley  Cogen (No.  4), LLC  (Medina
Valley),  which indirectly owns a 40 megawatt,  gas-fired electric co-generation
plant. With the acquisition,  Medina Valley became a wholly-owned  subsidiary of
Resources Company and was renamed AmerenEnergy Medina Valley Cogen (No. 4), LLC.
The  CILCORP  and  AmerenEnergy  Medina  Valley  Cogen (No.  4),  LLC  financial
statements will be included in our consolidated  financial  statements effective
with the January and February 2003 acquisition dates.

     We acquired  CILCORP to complement our existing  Illinois  electric and gas
operations.  The purchase included CILCO's  rate-regulated  electric and natural
gas businesses in Illinois serving  approximately 200,000 and 205,000 customers,
respectively,  of which approximately  150,000 are combination  electric and gas
customers.  CILCO's  service  territory is contiguous to our service  territory.
CILCO  also  has  a non  rate-regulated  electric  and  gas  marketing  business
principally  focused in the  Chicago,  Illinois  region.  Finally,  the purchase
includes   approximately  1,200  megawatts  of  largely  coal-fired   generating
capacity, most of which is expected to become non rate-regulated in 2003.

     The total  purchase price was  approximately  $1.4 billion and included the
assumption of CILCORP and Medina  Valley debt and preferred  stock at closing of
approximately  $900  million,   with  the  balance  of  the  purchase  price  of
approximately $500 million paid with cash on hand. The purchase price is subject
to certain  adjustments  for  working  capital  and other  changes  pending  the
finalization  of CILCORP's  closing  balance  sheet.  The cash  component of the
purchase  price came from Ameren's  issuances in September  2002 of 8.05 million
common shares and in early 2003 of 6.325 million common shares.

     For  additional   information   regarding  our  business  operations,   see
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations  and  Note 1 to our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of the 2002
Annual Report pages incorporated herein by reference under Items 7 and 8.


CAPITAL PROGRAM AND FINANCING

and Capital  Resources  in  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 5, 7, 8 and 14 to our Consolidated
Financial  Statements  of the 2002 Annual  Report pages  incorporated  herein by
reference under Items 7 and 8.

Financing

     In August 2002, a shelf  registration  statement filed by AmerenUE with the
SEC on Form S-3 was declared effective.  This statement  authorized the offering
from time to time of up to $750 million of various  forms of long-term  debt and
trust  preferred  securities to refinance  existing debt and preferred stock and
for general  corporate  purposes,  including the  repayment of  short-term  debt
incurred to finance  construction  expenditures and other working capital needs.
On March 10, 2003, AmerenUE issued,  pursuant to the shelf registration referred
to above,  $184  million  of 5.50%  senior  secured  notes  due March 15,  2034.
AmerenUE expects to use the net proceeds of the issuance of  approximately  $180
million,  along  with  other  funds to redeem  prior to  maturity  $104  million
principal amount of outstanding 8.25% first mortgage bonds due October 15, 2022,
at a redemption  price of 103.61% of par,  plus accrued  interest,  and to repay
short-term  debt  incurred to pay at maturity  $75 million  principal  amount of
8.33% first mortgage bonds that were due in December 2002.

     To issue first mortgage bonds and preferred stock,  AmerenCIPS and AmerenUE
each must comply with earnings tests contained in their respective mortgages and
Articles of Incorporation.  For the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds,
generally,  earnings  coverage  of twice the  annual  interest  charges on first
mortgage  bonds  outstanding  and to be issued is required.  Generally,  for the
issuance of additional  preferred stock,  earnings  coverage of one and one-half
times annual  interest  charges and preferred  stock dividends is required under
the AmerenCIPS Articles of Incorporation,  and earnings coverage of at least two
and one-half times the annual dividend on preferred stock  outstanding and to be
issued is required under AmerenUE's  Articles of  Incorporation.  The ability to
issue such  securities  in the future will depend on coverages at that time.  At
December  31, 2002,  each  company had and expects to continue to have  adequate
coverage  ratios  for  anticipated  requirements.  See  Notes  6  and  8 to  our
Consolidated  Financial  Statements of the 2002 Annual Report pages incorporated
herein by reference under Item 8 for additional financing information.

     CILCORP's and AmerenCILCO's  financial agreements include customary default
or cross  default  provisions  that could impact the continued  availability  of
credit or result in the  acceleration of repayment.  Many of Ameren's  committed
credit  facilities  require the borrower to represent,  in  connection  with any
borrowing under the facility, that no material adverse change has occurred since
certain  dates.  Ameren's  financing  arrangements  do not contain credit rating
triggers with the exception of certain triggers within  AmerenCILCO's  financing
arrangements.

     An event of default  will occur under a $25 million  AmerenCILCO  committed
credit facility if AmerenCILCO  fails to maintain a Moody's rating on its senior
secured  debt above Baa2 and a Fitch  credit  rating of BBB-.  Under  agreements
governing  $4.7  million  of  AmerenCILCO  funded  bank debt,  AmerenCILCO  must
maintain a Moody's  investment  grade  rating or an event of default will occur.
Also,  under a $100 million  funded bank term loan,  AmerenCILCO  must  maintain
investment  grade  ratings  for its first  mortgage  bonds  from at least two of
Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. As of February 2003,  AmerenCILCO's senior
secured  debt  ratings  from  these  rating   agencies  were  A-,  A2  and  BBB,
respectively. AmerenCILCO's Fitch ratings are on positive credit watch.

     At its current ratings level,  covenants in CILCORP's  indenture  governing
its $475  million  senior  notes  require  CILCORP to maintain a debt to capital
ratio of no greater than 0.67 to 1.0 and an interest  coverage ratio of at least
2.2 to 1.0 in order to make any payment of  dividends or  intercompany  loans to
affiliates   other  than  its  direct  and  indirect   subsidiaries,   including
AmerenCILCO.  However,  in the event CILCORP's senior long-term debt rating from
Fitch is increased by one notch to BBB,  CILCORP may make any such  distribution
or intercompany  loan without being subject to these tests  described  above. At
December  31,  2002,  CILCORP's  debt to  capital  ratio was 0.60 to 1.0 and its
interest  coverage ratio was 2.72 to 1.0,  calculated in accordance with related
provisions in this indenture.

     The common  stock of  AmerenCILCO  is pledged as security to the holders of
CILCORP's $475 million of senior notes and bonds.

     Covenants  in  AmerenCILCO's  $100  million  bank term loan  require  it to
maintain a minimum level of common  stockholder  equity and limit  AmerenCILCO's
ability to pay  dividends or otherwise  make  distributions  with respect to its
common  stock.  Any  violation  of these  covenants  will  result in an event of
default  under this  facility.  Under the  minimum  common  equity  requirement,
AmerenCILCO  must  maintain a minimum level of common  stockholder  equity which
increases from the date the facility was entered based on ongoing earnings.  The
maintenance  of this test is determined  upon each  anniversary  of the loan. If
this test was performed as of December 31, 2002, the minimum common equity level
requirement would equal approximately $301 million. At that date,  AmerenCILCO's
common  equity,  calculated in accordance  with this provision was $329 million.
Under the

                                       3

<PAGE>

restricted payments provision,  AmerenCILCO may only pay dividends to CILCORP up
to $45 million annually subject to limited carry forward if not fully utilized.

covenants,  see Liquidity and Capital  Resources in Management's  Discussion and
Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of  Operations  and Note 8 to our
Consolidated  Financial  Statements of the 2002 Annual Report pages incorporated

RATES AND REGULATION

Rates

     Rates that we are  allowed to charge for our  services  are the single most
important item  influencing  our financial  position,  results of operations and
liquidity.  We are  highly  regulated.  The rates we charge  our  customers  are
determined by governmental  organizations.  Decisions by these organizations are
influenced by many factors,  including our recent cost of providing service, our
quality  of  service,  regulatory  staff  knowledge  and  experience,   economic
conditions and social and political views. Decisions made by these organizations
regarding  our rates  could have a material  impact on our  financial  position,
results of operations and liquidity.

     For  the  year  2002,  approximately  60%,  25%,  and  15% of our  electric
operating  revenues were based on rates regulated by the Missouri Public Service
Commission  (MoPSC),  the  Illinois  Commerce  Commission  (ICC) and the Federal
Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (FERC),  respectively.  For  information on rate
matters in these  jurisdictions,  including  AmerenUE's recent Missouri electric
rate case,  see Results of Operations  and  Regulatory  Matters in  Management's
Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of  Operations  and
Note 2 to our Consolidated  Financial Statements of the 2002 Annual Report pages
incorporated herein by reference under Items 7 and 8.

General Regulatory Matters

     As a  holding  company  registered  with the SEC under  the  PUHCA,  we are
subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA, including provisions relating
to the issuance of securities,  sales and acquisitions of securities and utility
assets, affiliate transactions,  financial reporting requirements,  the services
performed by Ameren Services and AmerenEnergy  Fuels and Services  Company,  and
the  activities  of certain  other  subsidiaries.  Issuance  of  short-term  and
long-term  debt and other  securities  by Ameren and  issuance  of debt having a

subject to approval by the SEC under the PUHCA.

     Generating  Company  is  certified  by the  FERC  as an  "exempt  wholesale
generator"  under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and as a result is not a "public
utility company" under the PUHCA. As an exempt wholesale  generator,  Generating
Company is exempt from most of the provisions of the PUHCA that otherwise  would
apply  to it as a  subsidiary  of a  registered  holding  company.  Issuance  of
securities by Generating Company is not subject to approval by the SEC under the
PUHCA.  The SEC has no  jurisdiction  over the sale of electricity by Generating
Company to  affiliates  or  non-affiliates.  The SEC may impose  limitations  on
Ameren in  connection  with its financing for the purpose of investing in exempt
wholesale  generators  and  foreign  utility  companies  if  Ameren's  aggregate
investment  in  those  activities  exceeds  50%  of  its  consolidated  retained
earnings.  At December 31, 2002, Ameren's aggregate investment in those entities
was 23.7% of its consolidated retained earnings.

     AmerenCIPS,  AmerenUE and  AmerenCILCO are subject to regulation by the ICC
and AmerenUE is also subject to  regulation  by the MoPSC as to rates,  service,
issuance of equity  securities,  issuance of debt having a maturity of more than
twelve months,  mergers,  and various other matters.  Generating  Company is not
subject to regulation by the ICC or the MoPSC.

     AmerenCIPS,  AmerenUE,  AmerenCILCO and Generating Company are also subject
to  regulation  by the FERC as to  rates  and  charges  in  connection  with the
wholesale  sale of energy and  transmission  in  interstate  commerce,  mergers,
affiliate  transactions,  and certain other matters.  Issuance of short-term and
long-term debt by Generating Company is subject to approval by the FERC.

     In  many  states,  including  Illinois,  companies  that  sell  electricity
directly to retail customers  pursuant to state statutes and regulations must be
registered  or  licensed.  Marketing  Company has obtained  "alternative  retail

electricity  supplier" status in Illinois and plans to seek comparable status in
other states where retail competition is developing.  AmerenCILCO is an Illinois
electric  utility,  and as such,  is permitted to provide  power and energy on a
competitive basis to retail customers located outside its service territory.

     Operation of  AmerenUE's  Callaway  plant is subject to  regulation  by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Its Facility Operating License expires on October
18,  2024.  AmerenUE's  Osage  hydroelectric  plant  and  AmerenUE's  Taum  Sauk
pumped-storage  hydro plant,  as licensed  projects under the Federal Power Act,
are  subject to FERC  regulations  affecting,  among other  things,  the general
operation  and  maintenance  of the  projects.  The  license for the Osage Plant
expires on February 28, 2006, and the license for the Taum Sauk Plant expires on
June 30, 2010. We are currently seeking renewal of our Osage Plant license.  Our
Keokuk Plant and dam located in the Mississippi River between Hamilton, Illinois
and Keokuk, Iowa, are operated under authority, unlimited in time, granted by an
Act of Congress in 1905.

     For information on regulatory matters in these jurisdictions, including the
current  status of electric  transmission  matters  pending before the FERC, see
Regulatory  Matters  in  Management's   Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial
Condition and Results of  Operations  and Note 2 to our  Consolidated  Financial
Statements  of the 2002 Annual  Report  pages  incorporated  herein by reference
under Items 7 and 8.

Environmental Matters

     Certain  of  our  operations  are  subject  to  federal,  state  and  local
environmental  regulations  relating to the safety and health of personnel,  the
public and the environment,  including the identification,  generation, storage,
handling,  transportation,  disposal, record keeping, labeling, reporting of and
emergency response in connection with hazardous and toxic materials,  safety and
health standards, and environmental protection requirements, including standards
and limitations  relating to the discharge of air and water pollutants.  Failure
to comply with those statutes or regulations could have material adverse effects
on us,  including the  imposition  of criminal or civil  liability by regulatory
agencies or civil  fines and  liability  to private  parties,  and the  required
expenditure of funds to bring us into compliance.  We believe we are in material
compliance with existing regulations.

     The U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA) issued a rule in October
1998  requiring  22  Eastern  states  and the  District  of  Columbia  to reduce
emissions of NOx in order to reduce ozone in the Eastern  United  States.  Among
other things,  the EPA's rule  establishes an ozone season,  which runs from May
through September, and a NOx emission budget for each state, including Illinois.
The EPA rule requires states to implement controls  sufficient to meet their NOx
budget by May 31, 2004.  Total capital  expenditures to meet the AmerenCILCO NOx
emission requirements are estimated to be $123 million, of which $75 million was
expended  through 2002.  These costs include the  installation  of two Selective
Catalytic Reduction (SCR) units and combustion control modifications.

     (a)  The fuel cost for  natural gas  represents  the actual cost of natural
          gas and variable costs for transportation, storage, balancing and fuel
          losses for  delivery to the plant.  In  addition,  the fixed costs for
          firm   transportation  and  firm  storage  capacity  are  included  to
          calculate a  "fully-loaded"  fuel cost for the generating  facilities.
          Prior to 2001,  the use of natural gas by  AmerenCIPS  and  Generating
          Company was minimal.
     (b)  Represents all fuels utilized in our electric  generating  facilities,
          to the extent applicable,  including coal, nuclear,  natural gas, oil,
          propane, tire chips, and handling.
     (c)  On May 1, 2000, all of AmerenCIPS' electric generating  facilities and
          related fuel supply agreements were transferred to Generating  Company
          (see General section above).

Coal

     We  have a  policy  of  maintaining  coal  inventory  consistent  with  our
historical  usage. We may adjust levels based on  uncertainties of supply due to
potential work stoppages,  delays in coal deliveries,  equipment  breakdowns and
other factors.  As of December 31, 2002 and 2001,  approximately  59 days and 56
days, respectively, supply of coal was in inventory. For the year ended December
31, 2002, coal represented approximately 82% of our fuel supply.

Nuclear

     The  components of the nuclear fuel cycle  required for nuclear  generating
units are as follows:

     o    uranium;
     o    conversion of uranium into uranium hexafluoride;
     o    enrichment of uranium hexafluoride;
     o    conversion of enriched uranium  hexafluoride  into uranium dioxide and
          the fabrication into nuclear fuel assemblies; and
     o    disposal and/or reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.

     We have  agreements  and/or  inventories  to  fulfill  AmerenUE's  Callaway
nuclear  plant  needs  for  uranium,  conversion,   enrichment  and  fabrication
services.  Such  needs  are  satisfied  through  2004,  with  the  exception  of
enrichment  services.  A supply of enrichment  services for unfilled needs after
2004 is being  pursued.  Additional  contracts  will be entered into in order to
supply  nuclear fuel during the  remainder  of the life of the plant,  at prices
which cannot now be accurately  predicted.  The Callaway plant normally requires
refueling at 18-month  intervals,  and the next  refueling is scheduled  for the
spring of 2004. The Callaway plant is out of service for approximately one month
during a refueling.

     For the year ended December 31, 2002, nuclear represented approximately 13%
of our fuel supply. See Note 15 to our Consolidated  Financial Statements of the
2002 Annual  Report  pages  incorporated  herein by  reference  under Item 8 for
additional information.

Natural Gas

     The combustion  turbine  generator  equipment  (CTs),  which we placed into
commercial  operation  in 2002,  2001 and 2000 are fueled by natural gas or have
the  capability  to use  natural  gas or oil.  We use  natural gas to supply our
generating   facilities  during  peak  generating   periods.   Our  natural  gas
procurement  strategy is designed to ensure  reliable and immediate  delivery of
natural gas by optimizing  transportation,  storage,  and balancing  options and
minimizing  cost and price risk by  structuring  various  supply  agreements  to
maintain  access to multiple gas pools and supply basins and reducing the impact
of  price  volatility.  For the  year  ended  December  31,  2002,  natural  gas
represented  approximately 2% of our fuel supply. For additional  information on
CTs  and  related  fuel  matters,   see  Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources  and
Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Disclosures  About  Market Risk in  Management's
Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of  Operations  and
Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements of the 2002 Annual Report pages
incorporated herein by reference under Items 7 and 8.

Oil

     The  actual  and  prospective  use of  oil is  minimal,  and  we  have  not
experienced  and do not expect to experience  difficulty  in obtaining  adequate
supplies. For the year ended December 31, 2002, oil represented approximately 1%
of our fuel supply.

INDUSTRY ISSUES

     We are facing  issues  common to the electric  and gas utility  industries.
These issues include:

     o    the potential for more intense competition;
     o    the potential for changes in the structure of regulation;
     o    changes in the  structure  of the  industry  as a result of changes in
          federal  and  state  laws,  including  the  formation  of  unregulated
          generating entities and regional transmission organizations;
     o    weak power prices due to overbuilt capacity and a weak economy;
     o    numerous troubled  companies within the energy sector and their impact
          on energy marketing and access to the capital markets;
     o    on-going consideration ofadditional changes of the industry by federal
          and state authorities;
     o    continually  developing  environmental  laws,  regulations and issues,
          including proposed new air quality standards;
     o    public concern about the siting of new facilities;
     o    proposals for demand-side management programs;
     o    public  concerns  about  nuclear  decommissioning  and the disposal of
          nuclear wastes; and
     o    global climate issues.

     We are monitoring  these issues and are unable to predict at this time what
impact, if any, these issues will have on our operations, financial condition or
liquidity.  For additional  information,  see Outlook and Regulatory  Matters in
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of

     We are a member of MAIN (Mid-America  Interconnected Network), which is one
of the ten regional electric reliability councils organized for coordinating the
planning  and  operation  of the  nation's  bulk  power  supply.  MAIN  operates
primarily in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois and Missouri.

     Our bulk  power  system is  operated  as an  Ameren-wide  control  area and
transmission  system under the  FERC-approved  amended joint dispatch  agreement
between AmerenUE,  Generating Company and AmerenCIPS. The amended joint dispatch
agreement  provides a basis upon  which  AmerenUE  and  Generating  Company  can
participate  in  the   coordinated   operation  of  AmerenCIPS'  and  AmerenUE's
transmission  facilities  with  AmerenUE's and Generating  Company's  generating
facilities  in order to  achieve  economies  consistent  with the  provision  of
reliable  electric service and an equitable sharing of the benefits and costs of
that coordinated  operation.  In 2002, we had more than 30 interconnections  for
transmission  service and the exchange of electric energy,  directly and through
the  facilities  of others.  AmerenCILCO  is  currently  expected to continue to
operate as a separate  control area. As such, its generating  plants will not be
jointly  dispatched with the generating  plants owned by AmerenUE and Generating
Company.  AmerenCILCO is a transmission owning member of the Midwest Independent
System  Operating  (Midwest ISO) and has transferred  functional  control of its
system to the Midwest ISO. Transmission service on the AmerenCILCO  transmission
system  is  provided  pursuant  to the  terms of the  Midwest  ISO  open  access
transmission  tariff on file with the FERC. For  information on AmerenCIPS'  and
AmerenUE's  participation  in the Midwest  ISO,  see Note 2 to our  Consolidated
Financial  Statements  of the 2002 Annual  Report pages  incorporated  herein by
reference under Item 8.

          with two gas-fired CTs.
     (h)  These CTs are owned by  Generating  Company  and leased to its parent,
          AmerenEnergy Development Company. The operating lease is for a minimum
          term of 15 years  expiring  September  30,  2015.  Generating  Company
          receives rental payments under the lease in fixed monthly amounts that
          vary over the term of the lease and range from $0.8 - $1.0 million.
     (i)  Excludes  approximately  126  megawatts of two  coal-fired  generating
          units at Generating Company's Meredosia facility which were mothballed
          in December 2002.
     (j)  We acquired  ownership of these generating plants with our acquisition
          of CILCORP from AES on January 31, 2003.
     (k)  We acquired ownership of this generating plant with our acquisition of
          AES Medina Valley Cogen (No. 4), LLC from AES on February 4, 2003.

     (l)  "Net Heat  Rate"  represents  the  amount of energy to produce a given
          unit of output and is expressed as BTU per kilowatthour.
     (m)  Ameren owns a 60% ownership interest in EEI.

     As of December 31, 2002, AmerenCIPS owned approximately 1,900 circuit miles
of electric transmission lines.  AmerenCIPS operates one propane-air plant, four
underground  gas  storage  fields and  approximately  4,900 miles of natural gas
transmission  and  distribution  mains. As of December 31, 2002,  AmerenUE owned
approximately  3,200  circuit  miles of electric  transmission  lines.  AmerenUE
operates three  propane-air  plants and 2,900 miles of gas mains. As of December
31,  2002,  AmerenCILCO  owned  approximately  333  circuit  miles  of  electric
transmission lines.  AmerenCILCO operates two underground gas storage fields and
approximately  3,674 miles of gas  transmission and  distribution  mains.  Other
properties of the  companies  include  distribution  lines,  underground  cable,
office buildings, warehouses, garages and repair shops.

     Substantially  all of the properties and plant of AmerenCIPS,  AmerenUE and
AmerenCILCO  are subject to the direct  first liens of the  indentures  securing
their first mortgage  bonds. On May 1, 2000,  AmerenCIPS  transferred all of its
generating  facilities  and related assets to Generating  Company.  As a part of
this transfer,  AmerenCIPS' generating property and plant were released from the
lien of the indenture  securing its first  mortgage  bonds and such property and
plant are  presently  unencumbered.  For  additional  information  on this asset
transfer,  see General  section  under Item 1.  Business  herein.  During  2003,
AmerenCILCO plans to transfer substantially all of its generating facilities and
related assets to its non rate-regulated electric generating subsidiary, Central
Illinois Generation,  Inc. (CIGI). CIGI was incorporated in Illinois in November
2001  in   conjunction   with  the  Illinois  Law.  As  part  of  the  transfer,
AmerenCILCO's  generating  property and plant will be released  from the lien of
the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds.

     We  indirectly  own 60% of the  common  stock  of EEI,  which  owns  and/or
operates electric generation and transmission facilities in Illinois that supply
electric  power  primarily  to a uranium  enrichment  plant  located in Paducah,
Kentucky.  AmerenUE owns 40% of the common stock of EEI, and  Resources  Company
owns 20% of such stock.  On April 30,  2002,  AmerenCIPS  transferred  their 20%
common  stock  interest  in EEI to Ameren in the form of a non-cash  dividend of
common stock in EEI.  The book value of  AmerenCIPS  investment  in EEI was $1.8
million. Subsequently,  Ameren contributed such stock to Resources Company. This
transfer  completed the process of achieving a full  divestiture of all electric
generating  capacity  that had been owned  directly or  indirectly by AmerenCIPS
pursuant to restructuring  of the Illinois power industry.  The remaining 40% of
the  common  stock of EEI is held 20% each by  Kentucky  Utilities  Company  and
Illinova Generating Company.


ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

     We are  involved in legal and  administrative  proceedings  before  various
courts and agencies  with respect to matters  arising in the ordinary  course of
business,  some of which involve substantial  amounts. We believe that the final
disposition of these  proceedings,  except as otherwise noted in the 2002 Annual
Report pages incorporated herein by reference under Items 7 and 8, will not have
a material  adverse effect on our financial  position,  results of operations or
liquidity.

Waste Disposal

     On July 30, 2002, the Illinois Attorney General's Office advised us that it
would be commencing an enforcement  action concerning an inactive waste disposal
site near  Coffeen,  Illinois,  which is the  location  of a  disposal  facility
permitted by the  Illinois  Environmental  Protection  Agency to receive fly ash
from the Coffeen power plant.  The Illinois  Attorney  General also notified the
disposal  facility's  current and former  owners as to the proposed  enforcement
action. The Attorney General advised that it may initiate an action under CERCLA
to recover past costs incurred at the site  (approximately  $0.3 million) and to
obtain  a  declaratory  judgment  as to  liability  for  future  costs.  Neither
Generating  Company,   the  current  owner  of  the  Coffeen  power  plant,  nor
AmerenCIPS,  the prior owner of the Coffeen  power plant,  owned or operated the
disposal facility.  We believe that this matter will not have a material adverse
effect on Ameren's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Marketing Company - AmerenUE Power Supply Agreements

     In order to satisfy  AmerenUE's  regulatory load  requirements for 2001 and
2002,  AmerenUE  purchased,  under a one-year contract 450 megawatts of capacity
and energy (the 2001 Marketing  Company - AmerenUE  agreement) and 200 megawatts
of capacity and energy (the 2002 Marketing  Company - AmerenUE  agreement)  from
Marketing  Company.  These  agreements  were entered into through a  competitive
bidding process and reflected  market-based

                                       11

<PAGE>

rates.  Generating  Company  supplied the power for these  agreements  under its
power supply agreement with Marketing Company.

     The FERC accepted the 2001 Marketing Company - AmerenUE agreement as filed.
The 2002 Marketing Company - AmerenUE agreement was set for hearing to determine
that  the  contract  terms  were  just and  reasonable.  On March  12,  2003,  a
settlement between Marketing Company and the FERC Staff was approved by the FERC
effectively  resolving  all  issues  concerning  the 2002  Marketing  Company  -
AmerenUE  agreement  set for hearing.  While the FERC order  contains a standard
refund report requirement, no refunds are due under the settlement as approved.

     In May 2001 and May 2002, the MoPSC filed  complaints with the SEC relating
to these agreements.  While the complaints were pending,  the MoPSC and AmerenUE
reached an agreement for resolving these disputes.  The agreement requires us to
not enter into any new contracts to purchase  wholesale electric energy from any
Ameren affiliate that is an exempt wholesale  generator without first obtaining,
on a timely basis, the  determinations  required of the MoPSC that are specified
in Section  32(k) of PUHCA.  However,  this  commitment  did not prevent us from
completing the purchases  contemplated by the 2001 and 2002 Marketing  Company -
AmerenUE  agreements  and does not  prevent us from  making  short  term  energy
purchases  (less than 90 days) from an Ameren  affiliate,  without  prior  MoPSC
determination,  to  prevent or  alleviate  system  emergencies.  As part of this
agreement, the MoPSC has agreed to terminate its SEC complaints.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     Statements made in this report which are not based on historical facts, are
"forward-looking"  and, accordingly,  involve risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ  materially from those  discussed.  Although such
"forward-looking"  statements  have  been  made in good  faith  and are based on
reasonable assumptions,  there is no assurance that the expected results will be
achieved.  These statements include (without limitation) statements as to future
expectations,  beliefs, plans, strategies,  objectives,  events, conditions, and
financial  performance.  In connection with the "safe harbor"  provisions of the
Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995,  we are  providing  this
cautionary  statement to identify some important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those anticipated.  The following factors,  in
addition  to  those  discussed  elsewhere  in  this  report  and  in  subsequent
securities  filings,  could cause results to differ  materially  from management
expectations as suggested by such "forward-looking" statements:

o    the effects of the  stipulation  and  agreement  relating  to the  AmerenUE
     Missouri  electric  excess  earnings  complaint  case and other  regulatory
     actions, including changes in regulatory policy;
o    changes in laws and other  governmental  actions,  including  monetary  and
     fiscal policies;
o    the impact on us of current  regulations  related  to the  opportunity  for
     customers to choose alternative energy suppliers in Illinois;
o    the  effects of  increased  competition  in the future due to,  among other
     things,  deregulation  of certain aspects of our business at both the state
     and federal levels;
o    the  effects of  participation  in a FERC  approved  Regional  Transmission
     Organization,  including activities associated with the Midwest Independent
     System Operator;
o    availability  and  future  market  prices  for  fuel and  purchased  power,
     electricity and natural gas,  including the use of financial and derivative
     instruments and volatility of changes in market prices;
o    the cost of  commodities,  such as natural gas,  used in the  production of
     electricity and our ability to recover such increased cost;
o    average rates for electricity in the Midwest;

                                       12

<PAGE>

o    business and economic conditions;
o    the impact of the adoption of new accounting  standards on the  application
     of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance;
o    interest rates and the availability of capital;
o    actions of rating agencies and the effects of such actions;
o    weather conditions;
o    generation plant construction, installation and performance;
o    operation of nuclear power facilities and decommissioning costs;
o    the  effects  of  strategic   initiatives,   including   acquisitions   and
     divestitures;
o    the impact of current environmental regulations on utilities and generating
     companies and the  expectation  that more  stringent  requirements  will be
     introduced over time,  which could  potentially  have a negative  financial
     effect;
o    future wages and employee  benefits costs  including  changes in returns of
     benefit plan assets;
o    disruptions  of the capital  markets or other  events  making our access to
     necessary capital more difficult or costly;
o    competition from other generating  facilities including new facilities that
     may be developed in the future;
o    difficulties in integrating CILCO with Ameren's other businesses;
o    changes in the coal markets,  environmental  laws or  regulations  or other
     factors  adversely  impacting  synergy  assumptions in connection  with the
     CILCORP acquisition;
o    cost and availability of transmission  capacity for the energy generated by
     our  generating  facilities  or  required to satisfy  energy  sales made by
     Ameren; and
o    legal and administrative proceedings.

     Given these  uncertainties,  undue  reliance  should not be placed on these
"forward-looking"   statements.   Except  to  the  extent  required  by  federal
securities  laws, we undertake no  obligation  to publicly  update or revise any
"forward-looking"  statements,  whether as a result of new  information,  future
events or otherwise.
