                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995,  we are  hereby  filing  cautionary  statements
identifying  important  factors  that could  cause our actual  results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as such term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE  in this  Annual  Report on Form  10-K,  in  presentations,  in
response to questions or otherwise.  Any  statements  that  express,  or involve
discussions as to,  expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions or
future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or
phrases such as "anticipates,"  "believes,"  "estimates,"  "expects," "intends,"
"plans,"   "projects,"   "will  likely   result,"  "will  continue"  or  similar
expressions) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking   statements   involve   estimates,   assumptions,   risks   and
uncertainties  and are  qualified  in their  entirety by  reference  to, and are
accompanied by, the following important factors, which are difficult to predict,
contain  uncertainties,  are beyond our control and may cause actual  results or
outcomes  to  differ   materially  from  those   contained  in   forward-looking
statements:

 -       our ability to successfully implement our strategic objectives;
 -       prevailing governmental  policies  and  regulatory  actions,  including
         those of the United States Congress, state legislatures,  the FERC, the
         MPUC, the FPSC, the PSCW, and various local and county regulators,  and
         city  administrators,   about  allowed  rates  of  return,  financings,
         industry  and rate  structure,  acquisition  and disposal of assets and
         facilities,  real estate  development,  operation and  construction  of
         plant facilities,  recovery of purchased power and capital investments,
         present or prospective wholesale and retail competition  (including but
         not limited to transmission  costs),  and zoning and permitting of land
         held for resale;
 -       effects of restructuring initiatives in the electric industry;
 -       economic  and  geographic  factors,  including  political  and economic
         risks;
 -       changes in and  compliance  with  environmental  and  safety  laws  and
         policies;
 -       weather conditions;
 -       natural disasters;
 -       war and acts of terrorism;
 -       wholesale power market conditions;
 -       population growth rates and demographic patterns;
 -       the effects  of  competition,  including  competition  for  retail  and
         wholesale customers;
 -       pricing and transportation of commodities;
 -       changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
 -       unanticipated project delays or changes in project costs;
 -       unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;
 -       global and domestic economic conditions;
 -       capital market conditions;
 -       changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets;
 -       competition for economic expansion or development opportunities;
 -       our ability to manage expansion and integrate acquisitions; and
 -       the outcome of legal and administrative  proceedings  (whether civil or
         criminal) and settlements that affect the business and profitability of
         ALLETE.

Additional  disclosures  regarding  factors  that could  cause our  results  and
performance to differ from results or performance anticipated by this report are
discussed in Item 7 under the heading  "Factors that May Affect Future  Results"
beginning on page 36 of this Form 10-K.  Any  forward-looking  statement  speaks
only as of the  date on  which  such  statement  is made,  and we  undertake  no
obligation  to  update  any  forward-looking  statement  to  reflect  events  or
circumstances  after the date on which that  statement is made or to reflect the
occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it
is not  possible  for  management  to predict all of these  factors,  nor can it
assess the impact of each of these  factors on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the
extent to which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results
to differ  materially  from those  contained in any  forward-looking  statement.
Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various  disclosures made
by us in our 2004  Form 10-K and in our other  reports  filed  with the SEC that
attempt  to  advise  interested  parties  of the  factors  that may  affect  our
business.

                                     PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

ALLETE has been  incorporated  under the laws of Minnesota since 1906.  ALLETE's
corporate headquarters are in Duluth, Minnesota. As of December 31, 2004, we had
approximately  1,500  employees,  100  of  which  were  part-time.   Statistical
information is presented as of December 31, 2004,  unless  otherwise  indicated.
All  subsidiaries  are wholly owned  unless  otherwise  specifically  indicated.
References  in this  report  to  "we,"  "us" and  "our"  are to  ALLETE  and its
subsidiaries, collectively.

ALLETE files annual,  quarterly, and other reports and information with the SEC.
You can read and copy any information  filed by ALLETE with the SEC at the SEC's
Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. You can
obtain additional information about the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC
at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet site (www.sec.gov)
that contains reports, proxy and information  statements,  and other information
regarding  issuers  that file  electronically  with the SEC,  including  ALLETE.
ALLETE also maintains an Internet site  (www.allete.com) that contains documents
as soon as reasonably  practicable after such material is  electronically  filed
with or furnished to the SEC.

ALLETE's  operations are comprised of four business segments.  REGULATED UTILITY
includes retail and wholesale rate regulated electric, water and gas services in
northeastern  Minnesota and  northwestern  Wisconsin  under the  jurisdiction of
state  and  federal  regulatory  authorities.   NONREGULATED  ENERGY  OPERATIONS
includes nonregulated  generation (non-rate base generation sold at market-based
rates to the wholesale market) consisting  primarily of generation from Taconite
Harbor in northern  Minnesota,  and our coal mining  activities in North Dakota.
Nonregulated  Energy  Operations  also includes  generation  secured through the
Kendall County power purchase agreement,  which is expected to be transferred in
April 2005. (See Item 7 - Outlook.) REAL ESTATE includes our Florida real estate
operations.  OTHER includes our  telecommunications  activities,  investments in
emerging  technologies,  earnings  on cash,  and general  corporate  charges and
interest not specifically related to any one business segment. General corporate
charges  include  employee  salaries  and  benefits,  as well as legal and other
outside service fees.  Discontinued  Operations includes our Automotive Services
business that was spun off on September 20, 2004, our Water Services businesses,
the majority of which were sold in 2003, and costs incurred by ALLETE associated
with the spin-off of ADESA.

For a detailed  discussion  of  results of  operations  and  trends,  see Item 7
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations. For business segment information, see Notes 1 and 2.

SPIN-OFF  OF  AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES.  On  September  20,  2004,  the  spin-off of
Automotive  Services was completed by distributing to ALLETE shareholders all of
ALLETE's  shares of ADESA common stock.  Through a June 2004 IPO, our Automotive
Services business, doing business as ADESA, Inc. (NYSE: KAR), issued 6.3 million
shares  of  common  stock.   This  represented  6.6%  of  ADESA's  common  stock
outstanding.  ALLETE owned the  remaining  93.4% of ADESA until the spin-off was
completed. (See Note 3.)

Discontinued  operations  included  the  operating  results  of  our  Automotive
Services business until the spin-off.  Automotive Services,  which does business
independently  as ADESA,  operates  businesses  that are  integral  parts of the
vehicle redistribution  industry in North America. Those businesses include used
and salvage vehicle auctions and related services, and dealer financing. ADESA's
SEC filings are available through the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

SALE OF WATER PLANT  ASSETS.  In mid-2004,  we completed  the sales of our North
Carolina water and wastewater  assets, and our remaining 72 water and wastewater
systems in Florida.  In early 2005, we sold our wastewater  services business in
Georgia.  The net cash proceeds from the sale of all water and wastewater assets
in 2003 and 2004, after transaction costs, retirement of most Florida Water debt
and payment of income taxes, were  approximately  $300 million.  The transaction
relating  to the sale of 63 water and  wastewater  systems  in  Florida  to Aqua
America remains subject to regulatory approval by the FPSC. The approval process
may result in an adjustment  to the final  purchase  price,  based on the FPSC's
determination  of plant  investment  for the systems.  A decision is expected in
late 2005.

We own offices and service buildings, an energy control center and repair shops,
and lease offices and storerooms in various localities. Substantially all of our
electric  plant is subject to mortgages,  which  collateralize  the  outstanding
first mortgage  bonds of Minnesota  Power and of SWL&P.  Generally,  we hold fee
interest in our real properties subject only to the lien of the mortgages.  Most
of our  electric  lines are located on land not owned in fee, but are covered by
appropriate   easement  rights  or  by  necessary   permits  from   governmental
authorities.  WPPI  owns 20% of  Boswell  Unit 4.  WPPI has the right to use our
transmission line facilities to transport its share of Boswell generation.  (See
Note 10.)

SPLIT ROCK ENERGY was a joint venture  between  Minnesota  Power and Great River
Energy. In March 2004, we terminated our ownership interest upon receipt of FERC
approval.

Minnesota Power has wholesale contracts with 16 municipal  customers,  SWL&P and
Dahlberg  Light & Power Company in rural  Wisconsin.  (See  Regulatory  Issues -
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.)

Approximately  60% of the ore consumed by  integrated  steel  facilities  in the
United  States  originates  from six  taconite  customers  of  Minnesota  Power.
Taconite, an iron-bearing rock of relatively low iron content that is abundantly
available in Minnesota,  is an important domestic source of raw material for the
steel  industry.  Taconite  processing  plants use large  quantities of electric
power to grind the  ore-bearing  rock,  and  agglomerate  and pelletize the iron
particles into taconite pellets.  Strong worldwide steel demand,  driven largely
by extensive  infrastructure  development in China,  has resulted in very robust
world iron ore and steel  pricing  and has  consequently  resulted  in very high
demand  for iron ore and steel.  This  globalization  of demand  has  positively
impacted  Minnesota  taconite  producers,  which all  produced  near their rated
capacities in 2004. Annual taconite  production in Minnesota was 41 million tons
in 2004 (35 million tons in 2003; 39 million tons in 2002). Recent consolidation
activities,  combined  with the strong steel  market,  have placed the Minnesota
taconite  producers in a strong  position.  Cleveland-Cliffs  Inc and U.S. Steel
Corp.  have each announced  planned  significant  capital  investments to either
bring mothballed pellet  production  capacity back on line or to ensure existing
capacity  continues to operate with an investment in required  pollution control
equipment.

In addition  to serving the  taconite  industry,  Minnesota  Power also serves a
number of customers in the paper and pulp and wood products industry.  In total,
we serve four major paper and pulp mills directly and one paper mill  indirectly
by providing  wholesale  service to the retail  provider of the mill.  Minnesota
Power also serves four wood products manufacturers.

After suffering through a consecutive number of down years since 2000, the North
American paper industry  rebounded in 2004. The reasons for the rebound included
the decline of the dollar in  comparison  to the Euro,  which  resulted in fewer
imports to the United  States,  a recovering  economy and closing some  capacity
over the past several  years.  The past trend of the mills in Minnesota  Power's
service territory being acquired by new owners continued in 2004. In 2004, Boise
Cascade sold its paper,  wood products and timber  holdings to Madison  Dearborn
Partners,  including the  International  Falls paper mill which  Minnesota Power
serves,  the  former   Potlatch-Brainerd/Missota  Paper  mill  was  acquired  by
Wausau-Mosinee Paper Corporation,  and Potlatch's oriented strand board (plywood
substitute) plants,  including the Grand Rapids plant served by Minnesota Power,
were purchased by Ainsworth Lumber Company Ltd. of Vancouver, Canada.

LARGE  POWER  CUSTOMER  CONTRACTS.  Minnesota  Power  has large  power  customer
contracts with 12 customers (Large Power  Customers),  11 of which require 10 MW
or  more  of  generating  capacity  and one of  which  requires  8 MW or more of
generating  capacity.  Large Power Customer contracts require Minnesota Power to
have a certain amount of generating capacity available. (See Minimum Revenue and
Demand Under Contract  table.) In turn, each Large Power Customer is required to
pay a minimum monthly demand charge that covers the fixed costs  associated with
having this  capacity  available  to serve the  customer,  including a return on
common  equity.  Most  contracts  allow  customers  to  establish  the  level of
megawatts subject to a demand charge on a biannual (power pool season) basis and
require that a portion of their  megawatt  needs be  committed on a  take-or-pay
basis for at least a portion of the agreement. In addition to the demand charge,
each Large Power Customer is billed an energy charge for each  kilowatthour used
that recovers the variable costs incurred in generating electricity.  Six of the
Large Power Customers have  interruptible  service for a portion of their needs,
which provides a discounted  demand rate and energy priced at Minnesota  Power's
incremental cost after serving all firm power obligations.  Minnesota Power also
provides  incremental  production  service for customer  demand levels above the
contract  take-or-pay  levels.  There is no demand  charge for this  service and
energy is priced at an  increment  above  Minnesota  Power's  cost.  Incremental
production  service is  interruptible.  Contracts  with 8 of the 12 Large  Power
Customers  provide for deferral  without  interest of one-half of demand  charge
obligations  incurred  during  the first  three  months  of a strike or  illegal
walkout at a customer's  facilities,  with repayment  required over the 12-month
period following resolution of the work stoppage.

All contracts  continue past the contract  termination date, unless the required
advance  notice  of  cancellation   has  been  given.   The  advance  notice  of
cancellation  varies from one to four years. Such contracts  minimize the impact
on  earnings  that  otherwise  would  result  from  significant   reductions  in
kilowatthour  sales to such  customers.  Large Power  Customers  are required to
purchase all electric service requirements from Minnesota Power for the duration
of their contracts. The rates and corresponding revenue associated with capacity
and energy provided under these contracts are subject to change through the same
regulatory process governing all retail electric rates. (See Regulatory Issues -
Electric Rates.)

The MPUC  allows  Minnesota  Power to  require  taconite-producing  Large  Power
Customers  to pay weekly  for  electric  usage  based on  monthly  energy  usage
estimates.  A normal thirty-day  billing cycle with a 15-day payment period left
Minnesota  Power greatly  exposed to a significant  revenue loss if the customer
did not or could not make  payment due to  discontinued  operations,  or delayed
making payment for electric service pending a Chapter 11 bankruptcy  filing. The
customers receive  estimated bills based on Minnesota Power's  prediction of the
customer's energy usage,  forecasted  energy prices,  and fuel clause adjustment
estimates.  Minnesota Power's five taconite-producing Large Power Customers have
generally  predictable  energy usage on a  week-to-week  basis,  which makes the
variance between the estimated usage and actual usage small.  Taconite-producing
Large Power Customers  subject to weekly billings  receive interest on the money
paid to Minnesota Power within the billing cycle.

PURCHASED POWER

Minnesota  Power has  contracts  to purchase  capacity  and energy from  various
entities.  The largest  contract is with Square Butte.  Under an agreement  with
Square Butte expiring at the end of 2026,  Minnesota Power is currently entitled
to  approximately  71% (66%  beginning in 2006;  60% in 2007) of the output of a
455-MW coal-fired  generating unit located near Center,  North Dakota. (See Note
11.)

FUEL

Minnesota Power purchases low-sulfur,  sub-bituminous coal from the Powder River
Basin coal field  located in  Montana.  Coal  consumption  in 2004 for  electric
generation at Minnesota  Power's  coal-fired  generating  stations was about 5.1
million tons. As of December 31, 2004,  Minnesota  Power had a coal inventory of
about  516,000  tons.  Minnesota  Power has three coal  supply  agreements  with
various  expiration  dates  extending  through  2009.  Under  these  agreements,
Minnesota Power has the tonnage  flexibility to procure 70% to 100% of its total
coal  requirements.  In 2005,  Minnesota Power will obtain coal under these coal
supply agreements and in the spot market.  This diversity in coal supply options
allows  Minnesota  Power to  manage  market  price and  supply  risk and to take
advantage of favorable spot market prices.  Minnesota Power is exploring  future
coal  supply  options.   We  believe  that  adequate   supplies  of  low-sulfur,
sub-bituminous coal will continue to be available.

In 2001,  Minnesota  Power and Burlington  Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company
(Burlington  Northern) entered into a long-term agreement under which Burlington
Northern  transports all of Minnesota Power's coal by unit train from the Powder
River  Basin  directly  to  Minnesota  Power's  generating  facilities  or  to a
designated  interconnection  point. Minnesota Power also has agreements with the
Canadian National Railway and Midwest Energy Resources Company to transport coal
from the Burlington  Northern  interconnection  point to certain Minnesota Power
facilities.

The Square Butte  generating  unit operated by Minnkota Power burns North Dakota
lignite coal supplied by BNI Coal,  in  accordance  with the terms of a contract
expiring  in  2027.   Square   Butte's  cost  of  lignite  burned  in  2004  was
approximately  74 cents per MBtu. The lignite acreage that has been dedicated to
Square Butte by BNI Coal is located on lands  essentially all of which are under
private  control  and  presently  leased by BNI  Coal.  This  lignite  supply is
sufficient to provide the fuel for the anticipated useful life of the generating
unit.

REGULATORY ISSUES

We are exempt from  regulation  under the Public Utility  Holding Company Act of
1935 (PUHCA),  except as to Section  9(a)(2),  which relates to  acquisition  of
securities of public utility companies.  Efforts to repeal PUHCA continue at the
national level. We cannot predict the future of these legislative efforts.

We are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory  authorities.  The MPUC
has  regulatory  authority  over  Minnesota  Power's  service area in Minnesota,
retail rates,  retail  services,  issuance of securities and other matters.  The
FERC  has  jurisdiction  over  the  licensing  of  hydroelectric  projects,  the
establishment  of rates and charges for the sale of  electricity  for resale and
transmission of electricity in interstate  commerce,  and certain accounting and
record  keeping  practices.  The PSCW has  regulatory  authority over the retail
sales of  electricity,  water  and gas by  SWL&P.  The  MPUC,  FERC and PSCW had
regulatory authority over 56%, 7% and 7%, respectively, of our 2004 consolidated
operating revenue.

ELECTRIC RATES.  Minnesota Power has historically  designed its electric service
rates based on cost of service  studies under which  allocations are made to the
various classes of customers. Nearly all retail sales include billing adjustment
clauses, which adjust electric service rates for changes in the cost of fuel and
purchased energy, and recovery of current and deferred CIP expenditures.

In  addition  to  Large  Power  Customer  contracts,  Minnesota  Power  also has
contracts with large industrial and commercial customers with monthly demands of
more than 2 MW but less  than 10 MW of  capacity.  The terms of these  contracts
vary depending  upon the  customer's  demand for power and the cost of extending
Minnesota Power's facilities to provide electric service.

Minnesota  Power requires that all large  industrial  and  commercial  customers
under contract  specify the date when power is first required.  Thereafter,  the
customer is generally  billed  monthly for at least the minimum  power for which
they contracted. These conditions are part of all contracts covering power to be
supplied  to new  large  industrial  and  commercial  customers  and to  current
customers as their contracts expire or are amended. All rates and other contract
terms are subject to approval by appropriate regulatory authorities.

FEDERAL  ENERGY  REGULATORY  COMMISSION.  The  FERC  has  jurisdiction  over our
wholesale  electric  service and  operations.  Minnesota  Power's  hydroelectric
facilities,  which are located in  Minnesota,  are  licensed  by the FERC.  (See
Environmental Matters - Water.)

Minnesota  Power  has  contracts  with  16  Minnesota  municipalities  receiving
wholesale electric service.  One contract is for service through 2005 (8,000 MWh
purchased  in 2004) and one expires in 2006,  while the other 14 are for service
through at least 2007. In 2004, these municipal  customers purchased 712,000 MWh
from Minnesota Power.  Minnesota Power also has a contract for wholesale service
to Dahlberg Light & Power Company in Wisconsin.  Dahlberg  purchased 106,000 MWh
in 2004.

Minnesota  Power and SWL&P are members of the MISO.  MISO was the first regional
transmission  organization  (RTO) approved by FERC as meeting its Order No. 2000
criteria.  Minnesota  Power  and  SWL&P  retain  ownership  of their  respective
transmission assets and control area functions,  but their transmission  network
is under the regional operational control of the MISO, and they take and provide
transmission  service  under  the MISO open  access  transmission  tariff.  MISO
continues its efforts to standardize rates, terms and conditions of transmission
service  over the broad  region  encompassing  all or parts of 15 states and one
Canadian province,  and over 100,000 MW of generating capacity.  MISO operations
were  phased  in during  the  first  half of 2002.  In late  2003,  MISO and PJM
Interconnection LLC, a RTO serving all or parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, the
District  of  Columbia,  Maryland,  Ohio,  Virginia,  West  Virginia,  Delaware,
Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky,  executed a joint operating agreement. The joint
operating  agreement,  filed with the FERC, provides detailed  information about
each RTO's  operations and  establishes  procedures to strengthen and coordinate
reliability.  MISO has  continued  to  develop  and  implement  its  operations,
focusing on enhancing  transmission  system  reliability  and its performance of
independent market monitoring functions.

<PAGE>

Under MISO Day 2, the method by which Minnesota Power transacts wholesale energy
will change,  with both  Minnesota  Power load and generation  participating  in
MISO's day-ahead and real-time  markets.  Generation will also become subject to
MISO economic dispatch authority.  MISO Day 2 will start up on April 1, 2005. As
a result  of MISO Day 2  implementation,  energy  transactions  to serve  retail
customers  will be sourced by  wholesale  transactions  with MISO as the counter
party.  Minnesota  Power  anticipates  filing with the MPUC in  February  2005 a
petition to amend the fuel clause to  accommodate  costs and revenue  related to
MISO Day 2 market  implementation.  We are unable to predict the outcome of this
pending matter.

On November 9, 2004,  Minnesota Power and Rainy River Energy jointly filed their
triennial  market power  analysis with FERC.  This filing is a  requirement  for
Minnesota Power and Rainy River Energy to maintain their market-based rate sales
authority,  and the two  entities  must  prove  that  they lack the  ability  to
exercise  market  power.  Revised FERC  screening  methods  generally  result in
failure  to  meet  one of the  screens  by  integrated  utilities  that  are not
participating  in  qualified  RTOs.  A  mitigating  factor that should allow the
companies to maintain their  market-based  rate authority is their membership in
MISO,  and MISO's  move to the Day 2 market  (which  includes  a central  energy
market and  FERC-approved  market power  monitoring and  mitigation  program) in
April 2005.

Minnesota  Power also  participates  in MAPP, a power pool operating in parts of
eight states in the Upper Midwest and in two provinces in Canada. MAPP functions
include a regional transmission committee and a generation reserve-sharing pool.
Minnesota Power is also a member of the Midwest  Reliability  Organization  that
was  established  as a regional  reliability  council  within the North American
Electric Reliability Council on January 1, 2005.

MINNESOTA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION.  Minnesota Power's retail rates are based
on a 1994 MPUC  retail  rate  order that  allows  for an 11.6%  return on common
equity  dedicated to utility  plant.  Minnesota  Power does not expect to file a
request to increase  rates for its retail  utility  operations  during 2005.  We
will, however, continue to monitor the costs of serving our retail customers and
evaluate the need for a rate filing in the future.

As  required  by the MPUC,  on  December  23,  2004,  Minnesota  Power filed for
approval of a Rider for Distributed  Generation  Services,  along with a revised
Rider for Standby  Services,  necessary  to  implement  state law and the MPUC's
order regarding the  establishment of generic  standards for utility tariffs for
interconnection and operation of distributed generation facilities.  Distributed
generation is small-scale,  customer-based generation.  Minnesota Power's filing
utilizes  the  statewide  generic   interconnection   agreement  format,   while
implementing  a  distributed  generation  rider that is  particular to Minnesota
Power's  system for the costs of connecting  distributed  generation  systems to
Minnesota Power's distribution system.

In June 2003, the MPUC initiated an investigation into the continuing usefulness
of the fuel  clause  as a  regulatory  tool for  electric  utilities.  Minnesota
Power's   initial   comments  on  the  proposed   scope  and  procedure  of  the
investigation  were filed in July 2003. In November  2003, the MPUC approved the
initial scope and procedure of the  investigation.  The investigation will focus
on whether the fuel clause  continues to be an appropriate  regulatory tool. The
initial  steps will be to review the clause's  original  purpose,  structure and
rationale  (including its current operation and relevance in today's  regulatory
environment),  and then address its ongoing  appropriateness and other issues if
the need for  continued  use of the fuel  adjustment  clause is shown.  In April
2004, the DOC issued comments providing a wide array of alternatives,  including
closing  the  investigation  as one option and  eliminating  the fuel  clause as
another.  The MPUC has not taken action on any proposal and, as a result, we are
unable to predict the outcome or impact of this proceeding at this time.

Minnesota requires  investor-owned electric utilities to spend a minimum of 1.5%
of gross annual retail electric revenue on CIP each year. These  investments are
recovered  from  retail  customers  through a  billing  adjustment  and  amounts
included in retail base rates.  The MPUC allows  utilities to  accumulate,  in a
deferred  account  for  future  recovery,  all  CIP  expenditures,  as well as a
carrying  charge  on  the  deferred  account  balance.   Minnesota  Power's  CIP
investment goal was $3.1 million for 2004 ($2.9 million for 2003 and 2002), with
actual  spending of $3.1 million in 2004 ($5.0 million in 2003;  $4.0 million in
2002).  These amounts  satisfied  current  spending  requirements  and all prior
years' spending shortfalls.

In September 2004,  Minnesota Power filed our Integrated Resource Plan (Resource
Plan),  which predicts that energy demand by customers in our service  territory
will increase at an average annual rate of 1.7% over the next decade.  Growth of
20 MW to 30 MW per  year  primarily  from  residential  and  smaller  commercial
expansion  and a positive  outlook from Large Power  Customers  in  northeastern
Minnesota,  such as taconite processing  facilities and paper mills, is included
in the  Resource  Plan.  Minnesota  Power  will  also  realize  a  reduction  in
generating  resource  supply  over the next  three  years,  under the terms of a
long-term energy supply contract with Square Butte. The combination of increased
demand and reduced supply means Minnesota  Power will need to secure  additional
capacity  and energy to serve our  customers  in future  years.  In the Resource
Plan, we provide several options  designed to meet the predicted  growing demand
in the region.  The options range from purchasing  additional  power to building
new  energy  generation  facilities.  In  January  2005,  at the DOC's  request,
Minnesota  Power  filed  a  supplement  to the  main  filing  that  described  a
"representative"  resource plan for the DOC's analysis.  This plan is considered
preliminary according to the supplemental filing, since Minnesota Power is still
in the process of gathering and analyzing information on potential resources for
actual resource decision-making.

ALLETE 2004 Form 10-K                                                    Page 10

<PAGE>

A Request for  Proposal  (RFP) to external  bidders  for  additional  supply was
issued by Minnesota  Power in October 2004. In December  2004,  Minnesota  Power
received bids for renewable and non-renewable  resources,  as well as short- and
long-term  purchase offers. All RFP bids are being reviewed for completeness and
compliance with our requirements.  A simultaneous,  though separate, analysis of
Minnesota  Power's  self-build  and turnkey plant  options is also  occurring to
arrive  at  a   refined   list  of  those   options.   Once  the  RFP  bids  and
self-build/turnkey options are screened to identify the best choices among them,
a portfolio  analysis  process  will occur,  looking at  combinations  of supply
alternatives to meet our forecasted resource need. We will continue to work with
state regulators and other  stakeholders over the next several months to further
develop the Resource Plan and  anticipate  that the MPUC will formally  consider
the Resource Plan during 2005.

PUBLIC SERVICE  COMMISSION OF WISCONSIN.  SWL&P's current  electric retail rates
are based on a  September  2001 PSCW  retail rate order that allows for a 12.25%
return on common equity and resulted in an average rate decrease of 3.4%.

In June 2004, SWL&P filed an application with the PSCW for authority to increase
retail utility rates an average of 6.1%. This average increase is comprised of a
4.0%  increase  in  electric  rates,  a 7.0%  increase  in gas rates and a 12.1%
increase in water rates. The proposed  increases are due to increased  operating
costs,  primarily  pension,  insurance,  gross  receipts tax and parent  company
service costs.  SWL&P is requesting a 12.25% return on common  equity.  Hearings
took place in January 2005 and a final order is anticipated in the first half of
2005.

In December  2003, the PSCW  unanimously  approved the revised $420 million cost
estimate for the  Wausau-to-Duluth  electric  transmission line. Minnesota Power
and  transmission  planners  throughout the region believe the 220-mile,  345-kV
transmission  line is necessary.  Minnesota Power has been actively  involved in
the  permitting.  Construction  activities  in Minnesota  began in January 2004.
Minnesota Power does not intend to finance or own the proposed line.

COMPETITION

INDUSTRY  RESTRUCTURING.  State efforts  across the country to  restructure  the
electric  utility  industry have slowed.  Legislation  or regulation  that would
allow retail customer choice of their electric  service  provider has not gained
momentum in either Minnesota or Wisconsin.

At the national level,  the FERC continues in its efforts to have companies join
an RTO. FERC's sweeping  Standard Market Design  rulemaking,  renamed  Wholesale
Market  Platform,  appears to have stalled,  although FERC remains  committed to
implementing  most of the  rule in a more  piecemeal  fashion.  Minnesota  Power
supports the creation of a robust wholesale electric market.

Potential  federal  energy  legislation  would  seek  to  maintain  reliability,
increase investments in new transmission capacity and energy supply, and address
wholesale price volatility, while encouraging wholesale competition. These types
of provisions remain the subject of significant  controversy.  We cannot predict
the timing or substance of any future legislation or regulation.

FRANCHISES

Minnesota  Power  holds   franchises  to  construct  and  maintain  an  electric
distribution and  transmission  system in 90 cities and towns located within its
electric service territory. SWL&P holds similar franchises for electric, natural
gas and/or water  systems in 15 cities and towns  within its service  territory.
The  remaining  cities and towns  served do not require a  franchise  to operate
within their boundaries.  Our exclusive  service  territories are established by
state regulatory agencies.


NONREGULATED ENERGY OPERATIONS

BNI COAL owns and  operates  a  lignite  mine in North  Dakota.  BNI Coal is the
lowest-cost supplier of lignite in North Dakota,  producing about 4 million tons
annually. Two electric generating cooperatives, Minnkota Power and Square Butte,
presently  consume  virtually  all of BNI Coal's  production  of  lignite  under
cost-plus,  fixed fee, coal supply  agreements  expiring in 2027.  (See Fuel and
Note 11.) The mining process disturbs and reclaims  approximately  210 acres per
year.  The law requires that the reclaimed  land be at least as productive as it
was prior to mining.  That means if the land we mine once grew crops, it must be
able to do so again  after  reclamation.  The cost to  reclaim  one acre of land
averages  about  $15,000  and  can  run as high as  $30,000.  BNI  Coal  has the
equipment  necessary for the  reclamation  process.  In September 2004, BNI Coal
entered  into a  master  lease  agreement  with  Farm  Credit  Leasing  Services
Corporation  (Farm  Credit).  Under this new  agreement,  BNI Coal  leases a new
dragline that went into operation in October 2004. BNI Coal is obligated to make
lease payments  totaling $2.8 million annually for the 23-year lease term, which
expires  in 2027.  BNI Coal will have the option at the end of the lease term to
renew the lease at a fair market rental, to purchase the dragline at fair market
value,  or to  surrender  the  dragline  to Farm  Credit and pay a $3.0  million
termination fee. With lignite reserves of an estimated 600 million tons combined
with new dragline equipment, BNI Coal has ample capacity to expand production.

NONREGULATED  GENERATION.  Nonregulated  generation  is primarily  non-rate base
generation sold at market-based  rates to the wholesale market. In addition,  we
have 18,600  acres of land  acquired in 2001 at the time we  purchased  Taconite
Harbor from LTV Steel Mining Co.,  which is available for sale.  (See  Regulated
Utility - Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for MISO Day 2 discussion.)

TACONITE  HARBOR.  In  2002,  we  commenced  operation  of the  Taconite  Harbor
generating  facilities,  which we purchased in 2001.  The  generation  output is
primarily   being  sold  in  the  wholesale   market  and  is  sold  in  limited
circumstances to Minnesota Power's utility customers.

KENDALL  COUNTY.  In 1999,  Rainy  River  Energy  entered  into a 15-year  power
purchase agreement  (Kendall County).  The Kendall County agreement includes the
purchase of the output of one entire unit  (approximately 275 MW) of a four-unit
(approximately  1,100 MW) natural gas-fired  combined cycle generation  facility
located near Chicago,  Illinois.  Construction  of the  generation  facility was
completed in 2002. Rainy River Energy's obligation to pay fixed capacity related
charges began May 1, 2002 and would end in September  2017,  unless  assigned as
described below. We currently have 130 MW of long-term capacity and energy sales
contracts for the Kendall County  generation,  with 50 MW expiring in April 2012
and 80 MW expiring in September 2017.

In December  2004,  Rainy River  Energy  entered into an agreement to assign its
Kendall County agreement to Constellation Energy Commodities. Under the terms of
the agreement,  Rainy River Energy will pay Constellation Energy Commodities $73
million in cash  (approximately  $47 million  after taxes) to assume the Kendall
County  agreement.  The  proposed  transaction  is subject to the  approvals  of
LSP-Kendall Energy, the owner of the energy generation  facility,  as well as of
its project lenders and the FERC.  Pending these  approvals,  the transaction is
scheduled  to close in April  2005.  The  long-term  capacity  and energy  sales
contracts will also be transferred to Constellation Energy Commodities at
closing.

RAINY RIVER ENERGY is engaged in the acquisition and development of nonregulated
generation and wholesale power  marketing.  Rainy River Energy is a party to the
15-year Kendall County  agreement that is expected to be assigned in April 2005.
(See Nonregulated Generation - Kendall County.)

RAINY RIVER ENERGY CORPORATION - WISCONSIN continues to study the feasibility of
the  construction  of  a  natural  gas-fired  electric  generating  facility  in
Superior,  Wisconsin.  In accordance  with the PSCW's final order  approving the
project,  Rainy River Energy Corporation - Wisconsin undertook  preliminary site
preparation work in late 2003.

In 2004,  we sold 1.5 million MWh of  nonregulated  generation  (1.5  million in
2003; 1.2 million in 2002).

REAL ESTATE

ALLETE Properties is our real estate business that has operated in Florida since
1991. ALLETE Properties acquires real estate portfolios and large land tracts at
bulk prices, adds value through entitlements and/or infrastructure improvements,
and resells the  property  over time to  developers,  end-users  and  investors.
Management at ALLETE Properties uses their business relationships, understanding
of real estate markets and expertise in the land development and sales processes
to provide revenue and earnings growth opportunities to ALLETE.

ALLETE Properties is headquartered in Fort Myers,  Florida,  the location of its
southwest Florida regional office. We also have a regional office in Palm Coast,
Florida, which oversees northeast Florida operations.

Southwest  Florida  operations  consist of land sales and third-party  brokerage
businesses,  with  limited  land  development  activities.   Inventory  includes
commercial  and  residential  land located in Lehigh  Acres and Cape Coral.  The
property  represents  the  remaining   properties  acquired  in  1991  from  the
Resolution  Trust  Corporation  and in 1999 from  Avatar  Properties,  Inc.  The
operation  also  generates  rental  income  from a 186,000  square  foot  retail
shopping  center  located in Winter  Haven,  Florida.  The center is anchored by
Burdines-Macy's and Belk's department stores, along with Staples.

Northeast  Florida  operations  focus on land sales and development  activities.
Development  activities involve mainly zoning,  permitting,  platting and master
infrastructure   construction.   Development   costs  are  financed   through  a
combination of community development  districts,  bank loans, and company funds.
Our three major  development  projects  include Town Center at Palm Coast,  Palm
Coast Park and Ormond Crossings.

Town  Center  at  Palm  Coast  is  a  mixed-use,   planned  development  with  a
neo-traditional  downtown design.  Surrounded by major arterial roads, including
Interstate  95, the  development  was  selected as the site for the City of Palm
Coast's new city hall and is adjacent to the local hospital,  county airport and
high  school.  At  build-out,  the  development  is  expected  to include  2,950
residential  units, 2.2 million square feet of commercial space, and 1.4 million
square feet of office  space.  Actual  build-out  will  depend on future  market
conditions.  All major land use  approvals  for the project have been  received.
Platting, infrastructure construction and marketing efforts continue.

Palm Coast Park is a mixed-use,  planned  development  located in northwest Palm
Coast along U.S. Highway 1, one mile south of its  intersection  with Interstate
95,  with major rail line  access.  At  build-out,  the  project is  expected to
include 3,600  residential  units, 1.6 million square feet of commercial  space,
800,000 square feet of office space and 800,000  square feet of industrial  use.
Actual build-out will depend on future market  conditions.  In December 2004, we
received development order approval for the project. Platting and infrastructure
design are proceeding.

Ormond Crossings is a mixed-use,  planned  development  located along Interstate
95, at its  interchange  with U.S.  Highway 1, in northwest  Ormond Beach.  This
property  has three miles of  frontage on the east and west sides of  Interstate
95, is adjacent to the local airport and has access to a major railroad line. In
2004,  the  property  was  annexed  into the City of Ormond  Beach and  land-use
approvals are in progress.  Once approvals are received,  the project  build-out
mix can be estimated.

In addition  to the major  development  projects,  land  inventories  in Florida
include 5,200 acres of property.  Several smaller development projects are under
way to plat these properties, and modify and enhance existing zonings.

Property  sale prices may vary  depending  on  location;  parcel  size;  whether
parcels are sold as raw land, partially developed land or individually developed
lots;  degree and status of  entitlement;  and  whether  the land is  ultimately
purchased for residential, commercial or other form of development.

ALLETE  Properties  occasionally  provides  seller  financing,  and  outstanding
finance  receivables  were $9.7 million at December 31,  2004,  with  maturities
ranging up to ten years.  Outstanding  finance  receivables  accrue  interest at
market-based rates.

REGULATION

A  substantial  portion of our  development  properties in Florida is subject to
federal,  state  and  local  regulations,   and  restrictions  that  may  impose
significant costs or limitations on our ability to develop the properties.  Much
of our  property is vacant  land and some is located in areas where  development
may affect the natural  habitats  of various  protected  wildlife  species or in
sensitive environmental areas such as wetlands.

Development of real property in Florida  entails an extensive  approval  process
involving  overlapping  regulatory  jurisdictions.  Real  estate  projects  must
generally  comply  with the  provisions  of the Local  Government  Comprehensive
Planning  and Land  Development  Regulation  Act  (Growth  Management  Act).  In
addition,   development   projects  that  exceed  certain  specified  regulatory
thresholds  require  approval of a comprehensive  Development of Regional Impact
(DRI)  application.  The Growth  Management Act requires  counties and cities to
adopt   comprehensive   plans  guiding  and  controlling  future  real  property
development in their respective  jurisdictions.  The DRI review process includes
an  evaluation  of a project's  impact on the  environment,  infrastructure  and
government  services,  and requires the  involvement of numerous state and local
environmental,  zoning and community development  agencies.  Compliance with the
Growth Management Act and the DRI process is usually lengthy and costly.

COMPETITION

The real estate  industry is very  competitive.  Our  properties  are located in
Florida,  which continues to attract  competitive real estate operations at many
different levels in the land development pipeline. Competitors include local and
out of state  institutional  investors,  real estate  investment trusts and real
estate  operators,  among  others.  These  competitors,  both public and private
alike,  compete with us in seeking real estate for  acquisition,  resources  for
development and sales to prospective  buyers.  Consequently,  competitive market
conditions  may  influence  the  timing  and  profitability  of our real  estate
transactions.

OTHER

Our Other segment consists of our  telecommunications  business,  investments in
emerging  technologies  related to the electric  utility  industry,  earnings on
cash, and general corporate charges and interest not specifically related to any
one business  segment.  General  corporate charges include employee salaries and
benefits, as well as legal and other outside service fees.

ENVENTIS  TELECOM  is  an  integrated  data  services  provider  offering  fiber
optic-based   communication   and  advanced  data  services  to  businesses  and
communities in the Upper Midwest.  Enventis  Telecom  provides  converged IP (or
Internet  Protocol)  services that allow all  communications  (voice,  video and
data) to use the same fiber optic-based  delivery  technology.  Enventis Telecom
owns or has rights to  approximately  1,600 route  miles of fiber  optic  cable.
These route miles contain multiple fibers that total approximately  47,000 fiber
miles.  We also have  extensive  local fiber optic rings that  directly  connect
Enventis  Telecom  network with its larger  clients  (health  care,  government,
education,  etc.). Other local fiber rings connect Enventis Telecom's network to
the local telephone  company's  central offices,  from which locations  Enventis
Telecom can utilize the telephone  company's  connections  to access our smaller
clients.  Enventis Telecom also owns optronic and data switching  equipment that
is used to "light up" the fiber optic cable.  We serve customers from facilities
that are primarily  leased from third parties.  Enventis  Telecom has offices in
Duluth, Rochester,  Plymouth and Bloomington,  Minnesota. Enventis Telecom has a
strong business relationship with Cisco Systems, Inc. and is recognized by Cisco
Systems as a Gold Partner.  Enventis  Telecom is a regional  leader in deploying
leading edge  technologies  such as Voice over Internet (VoIP) technology and IP
Call Centers.

EMERGING TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO.  As part of our emerging technology portfolio, we
have  several   minority   investments  in  venture  capital  funds  and  direct
investments in privately-held,  start-up companies. Since 1985, we have invested
in start-up companies, which are developing technologies that may be utilized by
the electric  utility  industry.  We are committed to invest an additional  $4.5
million  at  various  times  through  2007  and do not  have  plans  to make any
additional  investments.  The  investments  were  first  made  through  emerging
technology funds (Funds)  initiated by other electric  utilities and us. We have
also made investments directly in privately-held companies.

Companies in the Funds' portfolios may complete IPOs, and the Funds may, in some
instances, distribute publicly tradable shares to us. Some restrictions on sales
may  apply,  including  but not  limited to  underwriter  lock-up  periods  that
typically  extend for 180 days  following an IPO. As  companies  included in our
emerging technology portfolio are sold, we will recognize a gain or loss.

We account for our  investment in venture  capital funds under the equity method
and account for our direct investment in privately-held companies under the cost
method. The total carrying value of our emerging technology  portfolio was $13.6
million at December 31, 2004,  down $23.9  million from  December 31, 2003.  The
decline was primarily due to a change to the equity method of accounting for the
venture  capital funds (see Note 14) and  impairments  related to investments in
privately-held  companies.  Our policy is to review these investments  quarterly
for  impairment by assessing such factors as continued  commercial  viability of
products, cash flow and earnings. Any impairment would reduce the carrying value
of the investment. In 2004, we recorded $6.5 million ($4.1 million after tax) of
impairment   losses   primarily   related  to  direct   investments  in  certain
privately-held,   start-up   companies  whose  future  business  prospects  have
diminished significantly.  Recent developments at these companies indicated that
future  commercial  viability  is  unlikely,  as is new  financing  necessary to
continue development.


ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Our  businesses  are subject to regulation by various  federal,  state and local
authorities  concerning  environmental matters. We consider our businesses to be
in  substantial  compliance  with  those  environmental   regulations  currently
applicable to their operations and believe all necessary permits to conduct such
operations  have been obtained.  We anticipate that potential  expenditures  for
environmental   matters  will  be  material  in  the  future,  due  to  stricter
environmental  requirements  through  legislation  and/or  rulemakings  that are
expected to require significant capital investments. We are unable to predict if
and when any such stricter  environmental  requirements  will be imposed and the
impact  they will have on the  Company.  We review  environmental  matters  on a
quarterly  basis.  Accruals for  environmental  matters are recorded  when it is
probable  that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can
be reasonably estimated,  based on current law and existing technologies.  These
accruals  are  adjusted  periodically  as  assessment  and  remediation  efforts
progress or as  additional  technical or legal  information  becomes  available.
Accruals for  environmental  liabilities  are  included in the balance  sheet at
undiscounted  amounts and exclude claims for recoveries  from insurance or other
third  parties.  Costs  related to  environmental  contamination  treatment  and
cleanup are charged to expense unless recoverable in rates from customers.

AIR.  CLEAN  AIR  ACT.  Minnesota  Power's  generating  facilities  mainly  burn
low-sulfur western sub-bituminous coal and the Square Butte generating facility,
located  in North  Dakota,  burns  lignite  coal.  All of these  facilities  are
equipped  with  pollution  control  equipment  such as  scrubbers,  baghouses or
electrostatic precipitators. The federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean
Air Act) created  emission  allowances for sulfur dioxide.  Each allowance is an
authorization  to emit one ton of sulfur  dioxide,  and each  utility  must have
sufficient  allowances to cover its annual emissions.  Emission requirements are
currently  being met by all of Minnesota  Power's  generating  facilities.  Most
Minnesota  Power  facilities

Page 15                                                    ALLETE 2004 Form 10-K

<PAGE>

have surplus sulfur dioxide emission allowances.  Taconite Harbor is meeting its
sulfur  dioxide   emission   allowance   requirements  by  annually   purchasing
allowances,  since  it  receives  no  allowance  allocation.  The  Square  Butte
generating   facility  is  meeting  its  sulfur   dioxide   emission   allowance
requirements through increased use of existing scrubbers.

In accordance  with the Clean Air Act, the EPA has  established  nitrogen  oxide
limitations for electric  generating units. To meet nitrogen oxide  limitations,
Minnesota Power installed advanced low-emission burner technology and associated
control  equipment to operate the Boswell and Laskin  facilities at or below the
compliance  emission limits.  Nitrogen oxide  limitations at Taconite Harbor and
Square Butte are being met by combustion tuning.

MERCURY EMISSIONS.  In December 2000, the EPA announced its decision to regulate
mercury  emissions from coal and oil-fired power plants under Section 112 of the
Clean Air Act.  Section  112 will  require  all such power  plants in the United
States to adhere to the EPA maximum achievable control technology  standards for
mercury.  The EPA issued a proposed  rule in December  2003.  Final  regulations
defining  control  requirements  are planned for March 2005.  The proposed  rule
offers two different  types of  regulation:  (1) imposition of an annual average
mercury  emission  limitation  applied at each unit or  facility  average  under
Section 112; and (2)  imposition  of a cap and trade  program under Section 111,
where an  allocation of mercury  credits  would be assigned and utilities  would
need to provide for a combination of emission reductions and credit purchases to
demonstrate  compliance.  The EPA has solicited comments about these approaches.
In either approach, continuous monitoring of mercury stack emissions is required
to be in service around 2008.  Minnesota Power's  preliminary  estimates suggest
that all of our affected  facilities  can be outfitted with  continuous  mercury
emission  monitors  for  under $2  million.  Our unit  mercury  emissions  tests
indicate  that all of our units are  expected to comply with the  proposed  unit
specific  target  emission  rate  without  significant   additional  cost.  Cost
estimates  about  mercury cap and trade  program  impacts are  premature at this
time.  The EPA is still  reviewing  comments  about  this  proposed  alternative
program and associated  final mercury credit  allocations to units that have not
yet been defined.

NEW SOURCE  REVIEW  RULES.  In  December  2002,  the EPA  issued  changes to the
existing New Source Review rules.  These rules changed the  procedures  for MPCA
review of projects at our electric generating  facilities.  In October 2003, the
EPA announced changes  clarifying the application of certain sections of the New
Source Review rules. These changes are not expected to have a material impact on
Minnesota Power. In December 2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia  Circuit  stayed the  implementation  of the October  2003 rule pending
their  further  review,  which is  expected in 2006.  Subsequently,  the EPA has
announced they are accepting  further public comments on the proposed New Source
Review rule revisions.

The EPA is pursuing an industry-wide investigation assessing compliance with the
New Source Review and the New Source Performance  Standards (emissions standards
that apply to new and changed units) of the Clean Air Act at electric generating
stations.  There is also ongoing litigation involving the EPA and other electric
utilities for alleged violations of these rules. It is expected that the outcome
of some of the cases could provide the utility industry direction on this topic.
We are unable to predict what actions, if any, may be required.

In June 2002, Minnkota Power, the operator of Square Butte, received a Notice of
Violation  from the EPA regarding  alleged New Source  Review  violations at the
M.R. Young Station,  which  includes the Square Butte  generating  unit. The EPA
claims  certain  capital  projects  completed by Minnkota Power should have been
reviewed pursuant to the New Source Review regulations, potentially resulting in
new air permit operating conditions. Discussions with the EPA are ongoing and we
are unable to predict the outcome or cost  impacts.  If Square Butte is required
to make significant  capital  expenditures to comply with EPA  requirements,  we
expect  such  capital  expenditures  to be debt  financed.  Our  future  cost of
purchased  power  would  include  our pro  rata  share of this  additional  debt
service. (See Note 11.)

WATER.  The Federal  Water  Pollution  Control Act requires  National  Pollutant
Discharge  Elimination  System (NPDES)  permits to be obtained from the EPA (or,
when  delegated,  from  individual  state  pollution  control  agencies) for any
wastewater  discharged into navigable  waters.  Minnesota Power has obtained all
necessary  NPDES  permits,  including  NPDES storm water permits for  applicable
facilities, to conduct its electric operations.

FERC LICENSES. Minnesota Power holds FERC licenses authorizing the ownership and
operation of seven  hydroelectric  generating  projects with a total  generating
capacity of about 115 MW. In June 1996,  Minnesota Power filed in the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the  District of  Columbia  Circuit a petition  for review of the
license  as issued by the FERC for  Minnesota  Power's  St.  Louis  River  Hydro
Project. Separate petitions for review were also filed by the U.S. Department of
the Interior  and the Fond du Lac Band of Lake  Superior  Chippewa  (Fond du Lac
Band), two intervenors in the licensing proceedings. Beginning in 1996, and most
recently in February  2005,  Minnesota  Power filed  requests  with the FERC for
extensions  of time to comply with  certain  plans and  studies  required by the
license that might conflict with settlement  discussions.  The Fond du Lac Band,
the  U.S.  Department  of the  Interior  and  Minnesota  Power  have  reached  a
settlement agreement for the St. Louis River Hydro Project. This settlement must
be approved by the FERC.  Upon  approval,  the FERC would then amend the project
license to reflect the conditions of the settlement  agreement.  Minnesota Power
submitted an application for amendment of the FERC license, based upon the terms
and  conditions of the  settlement  agreement in November 2004. In addition to a
one-time  retroactive payment of approximately  $600,000,  the Company estimates
that it will spend $100,000 to $250,000 per year for the use of tribal lands, to
fund fishery and natural  resource  enhancements by the Fond du Lac Band and the
Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,  and to conduct a mercury study under
the terms of the settlement.

CLEAN WATER ACT - AQUATIC ORGANISMS. In July 2004, the EPA issued Section 316(b)
Phase II Rule of the  Clean  Water  Act to  ensure  that the  location,  design,
construction  and  capacity  of cooling  water  intake  structures  at  electric
generating  facilities reflect the best technology  available to protect aquatic
organisms  from being killed or injured by  impingement  (being  pinned  against
screens or other  parts of a cooling  water  intake  structure)  or  entrainment
(being drawn into cooling water  systems and  subjected to thermal,  physical or
chemical  stresses).  It requires electric  generating  facilities that withdraw
more  than 50  million  gallons  of  cooling  water  per day and that use 25% of
withdrawn water for cooling  purposes only to reduce fish  impingement by 80% to
95% and fish  entrainment  by 60% to 90%.  The new  rule  for  fish  impingement
requirements apply to the Boswell,  Laskin,  Hibbard and Square Butte generating
facilities.  The  impingement  and  entrainment  requirements  apply to Taconite
Harbor  because it is located on Lake  Superior.  The rule  requires  biological
studies and  engineering  analyses to be performed  within the 2005 to 2008 time
frame.  The estimated total cost of these studies for our facilities is expected
to be in the range of $0.5  million to $1.0  million.  If  modifications  and/or
installation  of intake  structure  technology  (wedge-wire  screens,  fine mesh
traveling screens,  etc.) are needed, these capital costs are not expected to be
incurred  until 2009 to 2011. Due to the  flexibility of compliance  options and
litigation  activities  related to the new rule,  it is not possible to estimate
the capital expenditures that may be required.

SOLID AND HAZARDOUS  WASTE.  The Resource  Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976
regulates the management and disposal of solid wastes and hazardous wastes. As a
result of this  legislation,  the EPA has  promulgated  various  hazardous waste
rules. Minnesota Power is required to notify the EPA of hazardous waste activity
and routinely  submits the necessary annual reports to the EPA. The MPCA and the
Wisconsin   Department  of  Natural   Resources   (WDNR)  are   responsible  for
administering  solid and hazardous waste rules on the state level with oversight
by the EPA.

PCB  INVENTORIES.  In response to the EPA Region V's  request for  utilities  to
participate  in the Great Lakes  Initiative by  voluntarily  removing  remaining
polychlorinated  biphenyl  (PCB)  inventories,  Minnesota  Power  has  scheduled
replacement of PCB capacitor banks and  PCB-contaminated oil by the end of 2005.
The total cost is  expected to be about $2  million,  of which $1.5  million was
spent through December 31, 2004.

SWL&P  MANUFACTURED  GAS PLANT. In May 2001, SWL&P received notice from the WDNR
that the City of Superior had found soil  contamination on property  adjoining a
former  Manufactured  Gas  Plant  (MGP)  site  owned  and  operated  by  SWL&P's
predecessors  from  1889 to  1904.  The WDNR  requested  SWL&P  to  initiate  an
environmental  investigation.  The WDNR also issued  SWL&P a  Responsible  Party
letter in  February  2002.  The  environmental  investigation  is under way.  In
February  2003,  SWL&P  submitted a Phase II  environmental  site  investigation
report to the WDNR.  This report  identified  some MGP-like  chemicals that were
found in the soil near the  former  plant  site.  During  March and April  2003,
sediment  samples were taken from nearby Superior Bay. The report on the results
of this  sampling was completed and sent to the WDNR during the first quarter of
2004. The next phase of the  investigation is to determine any impact to soil or
ground  water  between the former MGP site and  Superior  Bay. The site work for
this phase of the investigation was performed during October 2004, and the final
report is expected to be sent to the WDNR during the first  quarter of 2005.  It
is anticipated  that additional site  investigation  will be needed during 2005.
Although it is not possible to quantify the  potential  clean-up  cost until the
investigation  is completed,  a $0.5 million  liability was recorded in December
2003  to  address  the  known  areas  of  contamination.   We  have  recorded  a
corresponding dollar amount as a regulatory asset to offset this liability.  The
PSCW has approved SWL&P's deferral of these MGP environmental  investigation and
potential  clean-up costs for future recovery in rates,  subject to a regulatory
prudency review.  ALLETE maintains  pollution  liability insurance coverage that
includes coverage for SWL&P. A claim has been filed with respect to this matter.
The insurance  carrier has issued a reservation of rights letter and we continue
to work with the insurer to determine the availability of insurance coverage.


EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2004, ALLETE had 1,500 employees, of which 1,400 were full-time.

Minnesota  Power,  SWL&P and Enventis Telecom have 621 employees who are members
of the  International  Brotherhood  of Electrical  Workers  (IBEW),  Local 31. A
two-year labor  agreement  between  Minnesota Power and Local 31, which includes
Enventis  Telecom,  is in effect  through  January 31, 2006, as is the agreement
with SWL&P.  The agreements  provided wage increases of 3.25% in each of the two
contract years.

BNI Coal has 95 employees  who are members of the IBEW Local 1593.  BNI Coal and
Local 1593 have a labor agreement, which expires on March 31, 2005. Negotiations
are under way for a new contract.

ITEM 5.    MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON  EQUITY, RELATED  STOCKHOLDER  MATTERS
           AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

We have paid dividends  without  interruption  on our common stock since 1948. A
quarterly  dividend of $0.30 per share on our common stock will be paid on March
1, 2005 to the  holders of record on  February  15,  2005.  Our common  stock is
listed on the New York Stock  Exchange under the symbol ALE and our CUSIP number
is 018522300  (formerly  018522102).  Dividends paid per share, and the high and
low prices for our common stock for the periods indicated as reported by the New
York Stock Exchange on its NYSEnet website, are in the accompanying chart.

The amount and timing of  dividends  payable on our common  stock are within the
sole  discretion of our Board of Directors.  In 2004, we paid out 77% of our per
share earnings in dividends.

Our  Articles  of  Incorporation,   and  Mortgage  and  Deed  of  Trust  contain
provisions,  which under  certain  circumstances  would  restrict the payment of
common  stock  dividends.  As of December 31, 2004,  no retained  earnings  were
restricted  as a result of these  provisions.  At February  1, 2005,  there were
approximately 33,000 common stock shareholders of record.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND
           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following  discussion  should be read in conjunction  with our  consolidated
financial  statements  and notes to those  statements  and the  other  financial
information  appearing  elsewhere  in this  report.  In addition  to  historical
information,  the following  discussion  and other parts of this report  contain
forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties.


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ALLETE went through a significant  transformation in 2004, and at the same time,
performed exceptionally well. We are stronger as a result, and from what we have
accomplished,  we are poised for substantial  earnings growth in 2005, excluding
an anticipated  one-time charge related to the Kendall County agreement.  (See -
Outlook.) Two significant  strategic  objectives were achieved--the  spin-off of
our Automotive Services business and the sale of our Water Services businesses.

On  September  20,  2004,  we  spun  off our  Automotive  Services  business  by
distributing  to ALLETE  shareholders  all of  ALLETE's  shares of ADESA  common
stock. In June 2004, our Automotive Services business,  doing business as ADESA,
Inc. (NYSE: KAR),  completed an IPO through the issuance and sale of 6.3 million
shares of its  common  stock.  This  represented  6.6% of ADESA's  common  stock
outstanding.  ALLETE owned the  remaining  93.4% of ADESA until the spin-off was
completed.  (See Note 3.) ADESA's SEC  filings are  available  through the SEC's
website at www.sec.gov.

In mid-2004,  we completed the sales of our North  Carolina water and wastewater
assets, and the remaining 72 water and wastewater  systems in Florida.  In early
2005, we sold our wastewater services business in Georgia. The net cash proceeds
from the sale of all  water  and  wastewater  assets  in 2003  and  2004,  after
transaction  costs,  retirement of most Florida Water debt and payment of income
taxes, were approximately $300 million.

Using a combination of internally generated funds, proceeds from the sale of our
Water Services assets and proceeds received from ADESA, we repaid $183.1 million
in  outstanding  debt in  2004  ($356.5  million  of debt  and  $75  million  of
mandatorily  redeemable  preferred  securities  in  2003),  which  significantly
strengthened our balance sheet and reduced interest expense in 2004. Our debt to
total capital ratio was 38% at December 31, 2004.

Income from  continuing  operations  represents the activities  that are part of
ALLETE  subsequent  to the spin-off of ADESA and the sale of our Water  Services
businesses.  REGULATED  UTILITY  includes  retail and  wholesale  rate-regulated
electric,  water and gas services in  northeastern  Minnesota  and  northwestern
Wisconsin under the  jurisdiction of state and federal  regulatory  authorities.
NONREGULATED ENERGY OPERATIONS includes  nonregulated  generation (non-rate base
generation  sold at  market-based  rates  to the  wholesale  market)  consisting
primarily  of  generation  from  Taconite  Harbor  in  northern   Minnesota  and
generation  secured  through  the  Kendall  County  power  purchase   agreement.
Nonregulated Energy Operations also includes our coal mining activities in North
Dakota. REAL ESTATE includes our Florida real estate operations.  OTHER includes
our  telecommunications   activities,   investments  in  emerging  technologies,
earnings on cash, and general  corporate  charges and interest not  specifically
related to any one business segment.  General corporate charges include employee
salaries and benefits, as well as legal and other outside service fees.

Income from continuing  operations before the change in accounting principle was
$39.1 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, for 2004 ($29.8 million, or $1.08 per
diluted share, for 2003;  $24.7 million,  or $0.91 per diluted share, for 2002).
Strong  earnings in 2004 were  attributed to increased  sales to our  industrial
customers,  as a result of their higher  production  levels,  and a  significant
reduction  in  interest  expense  due to  lower  debt  balances.  The  following
significant factors impact the comparisons between years:

   -    DEBT PREPAYMENT COST. In 2004, we incurred a $10.9 million, or $0.38 per
        share,  after-tax  debt  prepayment cost  as  part of ALLETE's financial
        restructuring in preparation for the spin-off of ADESA.
   -    GAIN ON ADESA SHARES.  In 2004, we recognized an $11.5 million, or $0.41
        per share,  gain on the sale of ADESA  shares related  to our ESOP. (See
        Note 17.)
   -    CHARGE. In 2002, Nonregulated Energy Operations incurred a $5.5 million,
        or $0.20 per share, after-tax charge related to  the indefinite delay of
        a generation project in Superior, Wisconsin.

In total,  net income and diluted  earnings per share for 2004 decreased 56% and
57%, respectively, from 2003. The decrease was primarily attributable to reduced
earnings from  discontinued  operations,  which included both Water Services and
Automotive  Services.  The  decrease  also  reflected  a $7.8  million  non-cash
after-tax charge for a change in accounting  principle related to investments in
our emerging  technology  portfolio.  (See Note 14.) Gains recognized in 2003 on
the sale of  substantially  all of our water and  wastewater  systems in Florida
contributed  to  higher  earnings  in  2003,  as did a full  year of  Automotive
Services operations.

NET INCOME

REGULATED UTILITY contributed net income of $42.8 million in 2004 ($37.9 million
in 2003;  $50.4 million in 2002).  The 13% increase in 2004 net income from 2003
reflected  an 8% increase in  kilowatthour  sales to our  industrial  customers.
Higher  expenses for pension,  and increased costs  associated with  maintenance
outages at Company  generating  facilities and a scheduled  outage at the Square
Butte  generating  facility,  were partially  offset by lower  depreciation  and
interest expense.  Overall,  regulated utility  kilowatthour  sales in 2004 were
similar  to 2003 and  2002.  In 2004,  a 5%  increase  in  sales to  retail  and
municipal  customers  reduced  the  energy  available  for sale to  other  power
suppliers. In addition,  Regulated Utility net income in 2004 also reflected the
absence of equity  income  from  Split Rock  Energy,  a joint  venture  which we
terminated  in March 2004 ($1.7 million in 2003;  $4.3 million in 2002).  Equity
income from Split Rock Energy in 2003 included a $2.3 million charge to exit the
joint venture.  In 2002, a $2.3 million one-time  deferral of costs  recoverable
through the regulated utility fuel clause increased income.

NONREGULATED  ENERGY  OPERATIONS  reported a $0.3  million net loss in 2004 (net
income of $3.7 million in 2003; an $8.7 million net loss in 2002).  The decrease
in 2004 net income was  primarily  due to a reduction  in net income at Taconite
Harbor and a one-time cost to terminate a transmission  contract  related to the
Kendall County power purchase  agreement.  Net income at Taconite Harbor in 2004
decreased, primarily due to costs associated with a scheduled maintenance outage
in 2004 and increased costs for sulfur dioxide emission allowances. In addition,
wholesale  power prices were lower in 2004.  Generation at Taconite Harbor first
came  online at various  times  during the first half of 2002.  Wholesale  power
prices were higher in 2003 compared to 2002.

Generation  secured through the Kendall County power purchase agreement began in
May 2002. An after-tax loss of approximately  $8 million,  which included a $0.7
million cost to terminate a  transmission  contract,  was recognized in 2004. In
December  2004,  we entered  into an  agreement  to assign  this power  purchase
agreement to Constellation Energy Commodities. (See Outlook.)

In 2002, a $5.5 million charge  related to the indefinite  delay of a generation
project in Superior,  Wisconsin,  reduced  income,  while 2003  reflected a $0.5
million reduction in the 2002 charge related to that project.

REAL ESTATE  contributed  net income of $14.7 million in 2004 ($14.1  million in
2003;  $11.2  million in 2002).  A strong  southwest  Florida real estate market
starting  in the fall of 2003 and  continuing  into 2004 was the main reason for
higher net income in 2004 and 2003, as well as an increase in the number and the
profitability  of real  estate  sales.  The timing of the closing of real estate
sales varies from period to period and impacts comparisons between years.

OTHER  reflected a net loss of $18.1 million in 2004,  down from a $25.9 million
net loss in 2003 ($28.2 million net loss in 2002).  A $9.8 million  reduction in
interest expense  resulting from lower debt balances was the main reason for the
improvement in 2004.  Financial  results for 2004 also included an $11.5 million
gain on the sale of ADESA  stock  related  to our ESOP (see  Note  17),  a $10.9
million debt prepayment cost associated with the retirement of long-term debt as
a part of our financial  restructuring  in preparation for the spin-off of ADESA
(see Note 8) and $4.1  million of  impairment  losses  related  to our  emerging
technologies  portfolio.  In addition, $1.6 million of equity losses on emerging
technology funds were recognized in 2004. In 2003, we reported net losses on the
sale  of  shares  we  held  directly  in  publicly-traded,  emerging  technology
investments.  Financial  results  for  2002  included  net  gains on the sale of
certain  emerging  technology  investments  and losses  related  to our  trading
securities portfolio, which was liquidated during the second half of 2002.

<PAGE>

DISCONTINUED  OPERATIONS includes our Automotive Services business that was spun
off on September 20, 2004, our Water Services businesses,  the majority of which
were sold in 2003,  costs  incurred by ALLETE  associated  with the  spin-off of
ADESA, and our retail stores, which we exited in 2002.

Automotive  Services  contributed  net income of $74.4  million in 2004  ($113.6
million  in 2003;  $88.2  million  in 2002).  Net  income in 2004 was down $39.2
million from 2003,  reflecting a 6.6%  reduction in our ownership of ADESA since
the June 2004 IPO and the  absence of ADESA  operations  since the  spin-off  on
September  20,  2004.  Net  income in 2004 was also down due to debt  prepayment
costs  related to the early  redemption  of ADESA debt in August 2004,  ALLETE's
costs associated with the business separation,  and additional corporate charges
and  separation  expenses  incurred by ADESA as it prepared to be a stand-alone,
publicly-traded  company. In addition,  2004 net income included $4.1 million of
charges in connection with a lawsuit related to ADESA's vehicle import business.
Net  income  in  2003  reflected  strong  vehicle  sales,  fee  increases,   the
introduction and expansion of service  offerings,  lower interest expense due to
lower debt balances at the time, gains on sale of property and strong receivable
portfolio  management at the floorplan  financing  business.  Net income in 2003
also  included  a  $1.3  million  recovery  from  the  settlement  of a  lawsuit
associated with ADESA's vehicle transport business.  Net income in 2002 included
a $2.7 million exit charge related to ADESA's vehicle transport business.

Water  Services  financial  results  were a $1.3  million  net loss in 2004 (net
income of $93.0  million  in 2003;  net income of $25.5  million  in 2002).  Net
income in 2004  decreased  $94.3  million  from  2003,  primarily  because  2003
included  the sale of  substantially  all of our  water and  wastewater  systems
serving various counties and communities in Florida.  A $71.6 million  after-tax
gain was  recognized on the sale of these  systems in 2003,  net of all selling,
transaction and employee  termination  benefit  expenses,  as well as impairment
losses on certain  remaining  assets at the time. Gains in 2004 from the sale of
our North Carolina assets and the remaining systems in Florida were offset by an
adjustment to gains  reported in 2003,  resulting in an overall net loss of $0.5
million in 2004.  The  adjustment to gains  reported in 2003 resulted  primarily
from an arbitration award in December 2004 relating to a gain-sharing  provision
on a system sold in 2003. Net income was also down from 2003, due to the absence
of operations  from water and  wastewater  systems sold. The majority of Florida
systems were sold in the fourth quarter of 2003. North Carolina assets were sold
in June 2004.

Financial  results for 2002  included a $1.2  million loss related to our retail
stores, primarily due to an exit charge.

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLE  reflected the cumulative  effect on prior years
(to  December  31,  2003) of changing  to the equity  method of  accounting  for
investments in limited liability  companies included in our emerging  technology
portfolio. (See Note 14.)


2004 COMPARED TO 2003

REGULATED UTILITY

     OPERATING  REVENUE was up $45.0 million,  or 9%, in 2004,  primarily due to
     higher fuel clause  recoveries  resulting  from increased  purchased  power
     costs (see operating  expenses below) and increased retail sales.  Overall,
     regulated utility  kilowatthour  sales were similar to 2003 (up 1%) as a 5%
     increase  in sales to retail and  municipal  customers  reduced  the energy
     available for sale to other power suppliers. Much of the increase in retail
     and  municipal   electric  sales  was   attributable  to  large  industrial
     customers,  due to their  higher  production  levels  in 2004.  Outages  at
     Company  generating  facilities and a scheduled  maintenance  outage at the
     Square Butte generating  facility (see operating expenses) also contributed
     to less energy being available for sale to other power suppliers.

     OPERATING  EXPENSES  in  total  were up  $38.0  million,  or 9%,  in  2004,
     primarily  due to a $34.3  million  increase  in fuel and  purchased  power
     expense.  Increased  purchased power was necessitated by outages at Company
     generating facilities and the Square Butte generating facility. In February
     2004, we experienced a generator failure at our 534-MW Boswell Unit 4. Unit
     4 came back into  service  in June  2004.  As a result of the  failure,  we
     replaced  significant  components  of the  generator  at a capital  cost of
     approximately $6 million.  The majority of the replacement cost was covered
     by insurance,  subject to a deductible of $1 million. We entered into power
     purchase agreements to replace the power lost during the Unit 4 outage. The
     cost of this additional power was recovered  through the regulated  utility
     fuel  adjustment  clause in  Minnesota.  While  Unit 4 was down,  some work
     originally planned for 2005 and 2006 was done during the outage to minimize
     future  outages.  This outage did not have a material impact on our results
     of operations. Two multi-week scheduled maintenance outages also took place
     at our 55-MW  Laskin Unit 1 and at the Square  Butte  generating  facility.
     Operating  and  maintenance  expense  was  $3.2  million  higher  in  2004,
     primarily due to outages at our generating  facilities.  Our pro rata share
     of the Square Butte maintenance  outage costs was approximately $5 million.
     In addition,  2004 reflected a $4.4 million increase in pension expense and
     a $1.7 million decrease in depreciation expense. In 2004, the MPUC approved
     longer depreciable lives for certain Company generating assets.

     INTEREST  EXPENSE  was down  $1.9  million  from  2003,  due to lower  debt
     balances in 2004.

2004 COMPARED TO 2003 (CONTINUED)

REGULATED UTILITY (CONTINUED)

     OTHER  INCOME  (EXPENSE)  reflected  $2.8  million  less  income  in  2004,
     primarily  due to the  absence  of equity in net  income  from  Split  Rock
     Energy. Minnesota Power withdrew from Split Rock Energy trading activities,
     effective November 1, 2003, and terminated the joint venture in March 2004.

NONREGULATED ENERGY OPERATIONS

     OPERATING  REVENUE  in  2004  was  similar  to  2003  as a 2%  increase  in
     kilowatthour sales was offset by lower wholesale prices. Kilowatthour sales
     were up 8% at  Taconite  Harbor  despite a fourth  quarter  2004  scheduled
     maintenance  outage,  while  kilowatthour sales at Kendall County were down
     26% from 2003.

     OPERATING  EXPENSES  were up $6.8  million,  or 7%,  in  2004,  due to $1.3
     million of costs associated with a scheduled maintenance outage at Taconite
     Harbor, a $1.2 million transmission contract termination charge to exit the
     Kendall  County  agreement and a $0.9 million  increase in costs for sulfur
     dioxide  emission  allowances.  Expenses in 2003  reflected a $0.9  million
     reduction  in costs  accrued in 2002 related to the  indefinite  delay of a
     generation project in Superior, Wisconsin.

     OTHER INCOME  (EXPENSE)  reflected $1.3 million of less income in 2004. The
     decrease was  attributable  to a reduction in gains on prior Minnesota land
     sales due to an MPUC required land reevaluation.

REAL ESTATE

     OPERATING  REVENUE was down $0.7 million,  or 2%, in 2004. In 2004, we sold
     1,479 acres and 211 lots for $35.8  million  (1,394  acres and 265 lots for
     $36.0  million in 2003).  At  December  31,  2004,  total land sales  under
     contract were $71 million,  of which $30 million were for properties in the
     Town  Center  development  project  at Palm  Coast.  Revenue  in 2003  also
     included the recovery of a partially reserved receivable.

     OPERATING EXPENSES were down $1.7 million,  or 9%, in 2004 because the cost
     of property sold in 2004 was lower than in 2003.  Cost of sales in 2004 was
     $6.5 million ($7.9 million in 2003).

OTHER

     OPERATING  REVENUE  was up  $14.6  million,  or 44%,  in  2004,  reflecting
     increased  revenue  from  our  telecommunications   business  due  to  more
     equipment sales.

     OPERATING  EXPENSES were up $12.3 million,  or 26%, in 2004,  mostly due to
     higher  cost  of  goods  sold   associated  with  increased  sales  at  our
     telecommunications  business.  Corporate  charges  were down  $2.2  million
     ($12.6 million in 2004; $14.8 million in 2003).  Lower corporate charges as
     a result of the spin-off of  Automotive  Services  and an insurance  refund
     partially  offset higher  incentive  compensation  and benefit  costs,  and
     expenses related to the reverse stock split.

     INTEREST EXPENSE (not specifically related to any one business segment) was
     down $16.8  million  from 2003  ($11.2  million in 2004;  $28.0  million in
     2003),  primarily  due to lower debt  balances.  We repaid $25 million of 6
     1/4%  First  Mortgage  Bonds in July  2003;  $50  million  of 7 3/4%  First
     Mortgage  Bonds in November  2003;  $75 million of  mandatorily  redeemable
     preferred   securities  in  December  2003;   $3.5  million  of  Industrial
     Development Revenue Bonds in January 2004; and $125 million of 7.80% Senior
     Notes  in July  2004.  In  addition,  $111  million  of  Pollution  Control
     Refunding  Revenue Bonds were refinanced at a lower rate in August 2004 and
     a $250  million  credit  agreement  entered  into in July 2003 was paid off
     early ($197 million in 2003;  $53 million in April 2004).  A combination of
     internally-generated  funds,  proceeds from the sale of our Water  Services
     assets and proceeds received from ADESA were used to repay the debt.

     OTHER INCOME  (EXPENSE)  reflected  $10.5 million of additional  expense in
     2004, primarily due to an $18.5 million debt prepayment cost related to the
     early  redemption  of $125 million in senior notes in 2004 and $6.5 million
     of  impairment   losses  recorded   related  to  our  emerging   technology
     investments.  In  addition,  $1.7  million  of equity  losses  on  emerging
     technology  funds were  recognized in 2004.  These decreases were partially
     offset by an $11.5  million  gain on the sale of ADESA  shares  held in our
     ESOP.  (See Note 17.) In 2003, we recognized $3.5 million of losses related
     to the  sale  of  shares  we  held  directly  in  publicly-traded  emerging
     technology investments.

<PAGE>


2003 COMPARED TO 2002

REGULATED UTILITY

     OPERATING  REVENUE  was up $12.1  million,  or 2%, in 2003,  mainly  due to
     higher fuel clause  recoveries  and natural gas prices.  Regulated  utility
     kilowatthour sales were similar to 2002. Fuel clause recoveries  increased,
     due to higher purchased power costs.

     OPERATING EXPENSES were up $26.5 million, or 7%, in 2003,  primarily due to
     a $5.8 million increase in fuel and purchased power expense, a $4.4 million
     increase in natural gas  expense  and a $4.8  million  increase in employee
     pension and benefit  expenses.  Higher  purchased power costs resulted from
     both  increased   wholesale  prices  and  quantities   purchased.   Planned
     maintenance  outages at our  generating  stations and lower output from our
     hydro  facilities  as  a  result  of  drier  weather   necessitated  higher
     quantities  of purchased  power in 2003.  Natural gas expense was higher in
     2003,  due to increased  prices.  Expenses for pension and  post-retirement
     health benefits increased,  mainly due to lower discount rates and expected
     rates of return on plan assets.  Operating  expenses in 2002  included a $4
     million  one-time  deferral of costs  recoverable  through the utility fuel
     adjustment clause.

     OTHER  INCOME  (EXPENSE)  reflected  $4.8  million  less  income  in  2003,
     primarily  due to less equity  income from our joint  venture in Split Rock
     Energy ($2.9 million in 2003; $7.3 million in 2002). Our 2003 equity in net
     income from Split Rock Energy  reflected a $2.3 million  charge  accrued at
     the time we reached an agreement to withdraw from this joint venture.

NONREGULATED ENERGY OPERATIONS

     OPERATING REVENUE was up $21.9 million,  or 26%, in 2003,  primarily due to
     increased  sales  of  nonregulated  generation  from  our  Taconite  Harbor
     facility  and  improved   wholesale   power  prices.   Increased  sales  of
     nonregulated generation resulted from Taconite Harbor being available for a
     full 12 months in 2003.  Taconite  Harbor  generation  first came online at
     various times during the first half of 2002.

     OPERATING  EXPENSES were up $0.2 million,  or less than 1%, in 2003, mainly
     due to fuel and purchased power expenses for  nonregulated  generation that
     came online during the first half of 2002.  Purchased power expense in 2003
     included a full 12 months of demand  charges  related to the Kendall County
     power purchase agreement,  while 2002 included only eight months. Operating
     expenses in 2002 included a $9.5 million  charge  related to the indefinite
     delay of the generation project in Superior, Wisconsin.

     INTEREST  EXPENSE was up $1.5 million,  predominantly  due to more interest
     capitalized in 2002.

REAL ESTATE

     OPERATING  REVENUE was up $9 million,  or 27%, in 2003, as a result of more
     land sales.  In 2003,  we sold 1,394  acres and 265 lots for $36.0  million
     (641 acres and 1,425 lots for $29.9 million in 2002).  Revenue in 2003 also
     included the recovery of a partially reserved receivable.

     OPERATING  EXPENSES were up $2.7 million,  or 17%, in 2003 because the cost
     of  property  sold in 2003 and selling  expenses  were higher than in 2002.
     Cost of sales in 2003 was $7.9 million ($6.8 million in 2002).

OTHER

     OPERATING  REVENUE  was up  $6.3  million,  or  24%,  in  2003,  reflecting
     increased  revenue  from  our  telecommunications  business,  due  to  more
     equipment sales.

     OPERATING EXPENSES were up $2.0 million, or 4%, in 2003,  reflecting higher
     cost   of   goods   sold   associated   with   increased   sales   at   our
     telecommunications business, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in
     corporate charges ($14.8 million in 2003; $17.0 million in 2002).

     INTEREST  EXPENSE  was down  $0.2  million,  or less  than 1%,  in 2003 and
     reflected  interest  expense not  specifically  related to any one business
     segment ($28.0 million in 2003; $28.2 million in 2002).

     OTHER  INCOME  (EXPENSE)  reflected  $2.1  million  less  income  in  2003,
     primarily  due to a $3.5  million  loss  related  to the sale of shares the
     Company held directly in publicly-traded  emerging technology  investments.
     In 2002, we recognized a $3.3 million gain on the sale of certain  emerging
     technology investments, which was more than offset by losses on our trading
     securities portfolio that was liquidated during the second half of 2002.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Certain accounting  measurements under applicable  generally accepted accounting
principles involve management's judgment about subjective factors and estimates,
the effects of which are inherently uncertain.  These policies are reviewed with
the audit committee of our Board of Directors on a regular basis.  The following
summarizes  those  accounting  measurements  we believe are most critical to our
reported results of operations and financial condition.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED  ASSETS.  We annually review our assets for impairment.
SFAS 144,  "Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," is
the  basis  for  these  analyses.  Judgments  and  uncertainties  affecting  the
application  of accounting  for asset  impairment  include  economic  conditions
affecting market valuations,  changes in our business  strategy,  and changes in
our forecast of future operating cash flows and earnings.

We  account  for  our  long-lived  assets  at  depreciated  historical  cost.  A
long-lived  asset is tested  for  recoverability  whenever  events or changes in
circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. We would
recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying  amount of a long-lived  asset
is not recoverable  from its  undiscounted  cash flows.  Management  judgment is
involved in both  deciding if testing for  recoverability  is  necessary  and in
estimating undiscounted cash flows. As of December 31, 2004, no write-downs were
required.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH AND LIFE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. We account for
our  pension and  postretirement  benefit  obligations  in  accordance  with the
provisions  of SFAS 87,  "Employers'  Accounting  for  Pensions,"  and SFAS 106,
"Employers'  Accounting for Postretirement  Benefits Other Than Pensions." These
standards  require the use of  assumptions in determining  the  obligations  and
annual  cost.  An  important   actuarial   assumption   for  pension  and  other
postretirement  benefit plans is the expected  long-term  rate of return on plan
assets. In establishing  this assumption,  we consider the  diversification  and
allocation of plan assets, the actual long-term  historical  performance for the
type of securities invested in, the actual long-term  historical  performance of
plan assets and the impact of current economic conditions,  if any, on long-term
historical returns. Our pension asset allocation is approximately 70% equity and
30%  fixed-rate  securities.  Equity  securities  consist  of a  mix  of  market
capitalization  sizes and also  include  investments  in real estate and venture
capital.  We  currently  use an expected  long-term  rate of return of 9% in our
pension  actuarial  study.  We annually  review our expected  long-term  rate of
return  assumption  and  will  adjust  it to  respond  to  any  changing  market
conditions.  A 1/2%  decrease in the  expected  long-term  rate of return  would
increase  the annual  expense for pension and other  postretirement  benefits by
approximately  $1 million after tax;  likewise,  a 1/2% increase in the expected
long-term rate of return would decrease the annual expense by  approximately  $1
million  after  tax.  (See  Note 16 for  additional  detail on our  pension  and
postretirement health and life plans.)

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS.  As part of our emerging technology portfolio, we have
several  minority  investments  in  venture  capital  funds and  privately-held,
start-up companies. We account for our investment in venture capital funds under
the  equity  method and  account  for our direct  investment  in  privately-held
companies under the cost method.  These  investments are included in Investments
on our  consolidated  balance  sheet.  Our policy is to  quarterly  review these
investments  for  impairment by assessing  such factors as continued  commercial
viability of products,  cash flow and earnings.  Any impairment would reduce the
carrying  value of the  investment  and be  recognized  as a loss.  In 2004,  we
recorded $6.5 million pretax of impairment  losses on these  investments  ($0 in
2003; $1.5 million pretax in 2002).

PROVISION  FOR  ENVIRONMENTAL   REMEDIATION.   Our  businesses  are  subject  to
regulation  by  various  federal,   state  and  local   authorities   concerning
environmental  matters.  We review  environmental  matters on a quarterly basis.
Accruals  for  environmental  matters are  recorded  when it is probable  that a
liability  has been  incurred and the amount of the  liability can be reasonably
estimated,  based on current law and existing  technologies.  These accruals are
adjusted  periodically as assessment and  remediation  efforts  progress,  or as
additional  technical  or legal  information  becomes  available.  Accruals  for
environmental  liabilities  are  included in the balance  sheet at  undiscounted
amounts and exclude claims for recoveries from insurance or other third parties.
Costs related to environmental  contamination  treatment and cleanup are charged
to expense.  We do not currently  anticipate  that  potential  expenditures  for
environmental  matters will be material;  however,  if we become subject to more
stringent remediation at known sites, if we discover additional contamination or
previously  unknown  sites,  or if we become  subject  to  related  personal  or
property  damage,   we  could  incur  material  costs  in  connection  with  our
environmental remediation.

TAXATION.  We are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects
of various  financial  transactions  and our ongoing  operations to estimate our
obligations to taxing  authorities.  These tax obligations  include income, real
estate and use taxes.  These judgments  include  reserves for potential  adverse
outcomes  regarding  tax positions  that we have taken.  We must also assess our
ability to  generate  capital  gains to realize  tax  benefits  associated  with
capital losses expected to be generated in future periods. Capital losses may be
deducted  only to the extent of capital  gains  realized  during the year of the
loss or during the three prior or five  succeeding  years.  As of  December  31,
2004, we have, where appropriate, recorded an allowance against our deferred tax
assets associated with impairment losses,  which will become capital losses when
realized for income tax  purposes.  While we believe the  resulting  tax reserve
balances as of  December  31, 2004  reflect  the most likely  probable  expected
outcome  of these  tax  matters  in  accordance  with  SFAS 5,  "Accounting  for
Contingencies,"  and SFAS 109,  "Accounting  for  Income  Taxes,"  the  ultimate
outcome  of  such  matters  could  result  in  additional   adjustments  to  our
consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material.

OUTLOOK

In the last 10  years,  our  average  annual  total  shareholder  return is 16%.
Approximately 4% of this average was attributed to dividends.  A $100 investment
in ALLETE  stock at the end of 1994  would  have been  worth  $439 at the end of
2004,  assuming  reinvestment  of  dividends  and shares  received  in the ADESA
distribution were sold and reinvested in ALLETE.  By comparison,  the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index averaged 12% for the same period, of which  approximately 2% of
the average was  attributed  to dividends.  A $100  investment in the Standard &
Poor's  500 Index at the end of 1994  would  have been  worth $312 at the end of
2004, assuming reinvestment of dividends.

Having completed the spin-off of our Automotive  Services  business and the sale
of our  Water  Services  businesses,  our  transformation  in 2004 has made us a
stronger company and positioned us for substantial growth in 2005.

2005 EARNINGS  GUIDANCE.  We expect ALLETE's  earnings per share from continuing
operations  to grow by 45% to 50% in 2005.  The growth is  expected to come from
continued  strong real estate sales,  lower interest expense and the transfer of
the Kendall County purchased power agreement.  The earnings expectation excludes
an anticipated one-time charge related to the Kendall County agreement.

The ESOP has been using proceeds from the sale of ADESA stock to purchase ALLETE
common stock on the open market.  Pursuant to AICPA  Statement of Position 93-6,
"Employers'  Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans,"  unallocated ALLETE
common  stock  currently  held and  purchased  by the ESOP  will be  treated  as
unearned ESOP shares and not  considered as  outstanding  for earnings per share
computations.  ESOP shares are included in earnings per share computations after
they are allocated to participants. At December 31, 2004, the ESOP had purchased
1.0 million  shares of ALLETE  common stock and had $30.3  million of restricted
cash.  During  January 2005, the ESOP purchased an additional 0.5 million shares
of ALLETE  common stock and had $8.9 million of  restricted  cash at January 31,
2005. (See Note 17.)

REGULATED UTILITY AND NONREGULATED ENERGY OPERATIONS.  Over the next five years,
we believe electric  utilities will face three major issues:  ongoing changes in
regional   transmission   structure;   the   probable   enactment   of  stricter
environmental  regulations;  and  possible  federal  legislation  impacting  the
structure  and  organization  of the  electric  utility  industry.  The FERC may
consolidate  transmission  regions,  which  could  impact  states'  transmission
regulation  rights  and create a more  standardized  wholesale  power  market to
oversee how  transmission  prices are determined.  As part of this larger policy
effort,  MISO will launch  day-ahead and real-time  energy market  operations on
April 1,  2005.  We are not yet able to  predict  the  impact of the  soon-to-be
initiated MISO Day 2 market on the Company's operations. We have been diligently
participating with MISO in market launch preparations and tests, and our systems
and  procedures  for  operating  within the new  market  are in place.  Stricter
environmental  requirements  through legislation and/or rulemakings are expected
to require significant  capital  investments in the 2008 to 2012 timeframe.  The
expenditures will relate to new emission controls on existing  generating units.
Congress is expected to take up energy legislation in 2005. Repeal of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) is likely to be one of the electric  utility
sector reforms addressed in the bill. PUHCA imposes  geographic  restrictions on
large  electric  and gas  utility  operations  and limits  diversification  into
non-utility businesses. More electric industry consolidation could occur and new
players could enter the industry if PUHCA is repealed.

We believe our Regulated Utility and Nonregulated  Energy Operations  businesses
are well positioned to  successfully  deal with the issues we have described and
to compete  successfully.  Our access to and ownership of low-cost power are our
greatest strengths.  We anticipate securing additional competitive resources for
our  forecasted  load growth.  We  anticipate  that we will have ready access to
sufficient capital for general business  purposes.  We believe electric industry
deregulation is unlikely in Minnesota or Wisconsin in the next five years.

REGULATED  UTILITY  STRATEGY.  We will  leverage the  strengths of our Regulated
Utility business to improve the Company's  strategic and financial  outlook.  In
addition, we will evaluate growth opportunities  through merger,  acquisition or
asset additions in our region.

RESOURCE  PLAN. In 2004, we filed an integrated  resource plan  (Resource  Plan)
with the MPUC,  detailing our retail energy  demand  projections  and our energy
sourcing  options to meet the  projected  demand over the next 15 years.  In the
Resource  Plan,  we predict  that  retail  demand by  customers  in our  service
territory  will increase at an average annual rate of 1.7% to 2019. The Resource
Plan forecasts growth of 20 MW to 30 MW per year, primarily from residential and
smaller commercial expansion,  and a positive outlook from Large Power Customers
in  northeastern  Minnesota,  such as taconite  processing  facilities and paper
mills.  We expect to realize a reduction in generating  resource supply over the
next few years under the terms of our  long-term  energy  supply  contract  with
Square Butte.  The combination of increased  demands and reduced supply means we
will need to secure additional base load energy to serve our customers in future
years.

The Resource  Plan sets forth  several  options  designed to meet our  predicted
retail base load demand growth.  Options range from purchasing  additional power
to building new base load energy generation facilities.  We will further analyze
portfolio  alternatives  for meeting our forecast and work with state regulators
and other  stakeholders  over the next  several  months to further  develop  the
Resource Plan. We anticipate  that the MPUC will formally  consider the Resource
Plan during 2005.

<PAGE>


RATE CASE. In other regulatory activity,  SWL&P filed a request with the PSCW in
2004 to increase retail rates. A ruling is anticipated  during the first half of
2005.  Minnesota  Power does not expect to file a request to increase  rates for
its retail utility operations during 2005. We will, however, continue to monitor
the costs of  serving  our retail  customers  and  evaluate  the need for a rate
filing in the future.

INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS.  Approximately 50% of our regulated utility electric sales
is made to taconite  producers,  paper  producers  and oil  pipeline  operators.
During 2004, the multi-year  domestic  integrated-steel  industry  consolidation
began  to  reach  operating   fruition.   Combined  with  improving  markets,  a
consolidated  steel industry should  continue to stabilize and potentially  even
increase the demand for taconite as a raw material in steel production. Based on
our research of the taconite industry, Minnesota taconite production for 2005 is
again  anticipated  to be about 41 million  tons (41  million  tons in 2004;  35
million tons in 2003;  39 million tons in 2002).  Although the current  taconite
pellet  market looks  strong,  the taconite  industry is cyclical and subject to
several factors,  which could dramatically change this forecast. In the event of
a significant  change in the taconite markets,  we expect that any excess energy
not used by our retail  customers  will be marketed  primarily  to the  regional
wholesale  market.  Paper  prices have also  improved  and we  anticipate a more
profitable outlook for the domestic paper industry over the next few years.

Since 2001, Mesabi Nugget,  owned by Kobe Steel, Ltd.,  Cleveland-Cliffs Inc and
Steel  Dynamics,  Inc., has been testing the  technology of converting  taconite
into  pig  iron  at a  pilot  plant  in  Silver  Bay,  Minnesota.  Environmental
permitting on a full-scale  production plant in northeast Minnesota is under way
and such plant would be a significant energy user. In 2004, UPM-Kymmene, a Large
Power Customer, began a year-long economic and environmental study to assess the
feasibility  of expanding its Blandin Paper mill in Grand Rapids,  Minnesota.  A
new paper machine would require an additional 100 MW of electricity by 2008. The
addition  of these two  potential  major  industrial  energy  users in  northern
Minnesota is positive for the Company, as well as the communities we serve.

Our strong  relationships  with industrial  customers are unique in the electric
industry and enable us to work  closely with them to help ensure their  success.
We continue to maintain these relationships with this group of customers to help
retain a solid industrial base in our region. We continue to make investments to
maintain  and  improve  the  integrity  of  our  generating,   transmission  and
distribution assets, and maintain environmental compliance.

FUEL CLAUSE.  In 2003, the MPUC initiated an  investigation  into the continuing
usefulness of the fuel clause as a regulatory tool for electric  utilities.  The
initial steps of the investigation were to review the clause's original purpose,
structure  and  rationale  (including  its current  operation  and  relevance in
today's regulatory  environment),  and then address its ongoing  appropriateness
and other issues if the need for continued use of the fuel adjustment  clause is
shown.  The MPUC has not taken action on any proposal  and, as a result,  we are
unable to predict the outcome or impact of this proceeding at this time.

KENDALL COUNTY. To eliminate ongoing losses from capacity charges for generation
secured through the Kendall County power purchase  agreement,  in December 2004,
we  entered  into an  agreement  to assign  this  power  purchase  agreement  to
Constellation Energy Commodities.  Under the terms of the agreement, we will pay
Constellation  Energy Commodities $73 million in cash (approximately $47 million
after taxes) to assume the power purchase agreement,  which is in effect through
mid-September  2017.  The proposed  transaction  is subject to the  approvals of
LSP-Kendall  Energy,  as well as of its project  lenders  and the FERC.  Pending
these  approvals,  the  transaction  is  scheduled  to close in April  2005.  We
currently have  approximately  130 MW of long-term  capacity sales contracts for
the Kendall County  generation,  which will also be transferred to Constellation
Energy Commodities at closing.

TACONITE  HARBOR.  A majority of the output from our Taconite Harbor  generating
unit is sold under long-term  wholesale  contracts through  mid-2010.  Remaining
Taconite  Harbor  energy  is sold on a  shorter-term  basis  into the  wholesale
market.

NONREGULATED ENERGY OPERATIONS STRATEGY.  Following the anticipated  disposition
of the Kendall County contractual  position in April 2005, this business segment
will be composed of generating assets in northeastern  Minnesota and BNI Coal in
North Dakota.  Our strategy is to enhance the  profitability of these operations
where possible and seek growth  opportunities in close  geographic  proximity to
existing operations in Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin.

REAL ESTATE.  With an inventory of land in desirable Florida  locations,  ALLETE
Properties is poised for a growing and consistent  contribution  to earnings and
cash flow. A large portion of our real estate  inventory is located in Florida's
Flagler  and  Volusia  Counties,  an  area  with  one  of  the  fastest  growing
populations in the United States.  We expect this population growth to continue,
which will increase the demand for real estate in the area.

We have three major planned developments under way. They are Town Center at Palm
Coast,  which will be a new downtown for Palm Coast, Palm Coast Park, located in
northwest  Palm  Coast,  and Ormond  Crossings,  located in Ormond  Beach  along
Interstate 95. As property within these developments is made available for sale,
we expect that these projects will contribute a significant amount of net income
for our real estate business.  Other ongoing land sales and rental income at the
retail shopping center in Winter Haven provide additional revenue.

Page 31                                                    ALLETE 2004 Form 10-K

<PAGE>

ALLETE  Properties plans to maximize the value of the property it currently owns
through entitlement and infrastructure improvements,  and then sell it at market
prices.  In addition  to managing  its  current  real estate  inventory,  ALLETE
Properties will focus on identifying, acquiring and entitling vacant land in the
coastal southeast United States.

OTHER.  We have  the  potential  to  recognize  gains or  losses  on the sale of
investments in our emerging technology portfolio. We plan to sell investments in
our  emerging  technology  portfolio  as  shares  are  distributed  to us.  Some
restrictions  on sales may  apply,  including  but not  limited  to  underwriter
lock-up  periods that typically  extend for 180 days following an initial public
offering.  We have committed to make additional  investments in certain emerging
technology  holdings.  The total future  commitment was $4.5 million at December
31, 2004 and is expected to be invested at various times through 2007. We do not
have plans to make any additional investments beyond this commitment.

DIVERSIFICATION.  We have a long history of both acquiring and selling companies
in a variety of industries,  and these activities have contributed significantly
to overall financial  results.  We will seek to diversify our earnings stream to
mitigate  potential  downside exposure to industrial  customers in our Regulated
Utility business and to provide additional earnings growth.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES

A primary goal of our  strategic  plan is to improve cash flow from  operations.
Our  strategy  includes  growing our  businesses  both  internally  by expanding
facilities,  services and operations (see Capital Requirements),  and externally
through acquisitions.

We believe our  financial  condition  is strong,  as  evidenced by cash and cash
equivalents  of  $194.1  million  and a debt to  total  capital  ratio of 38% at
December 31, 2004.  We  continued  to generate  strong cash flow from  operating
activities,  which  amounted to $62.3  million in 2004,  excluding  discontinued
operations ($118.0 million in 2003; $226.5 million in 2002). Cash from operating
activities was lower in 2004, due to a $6.7 million outstanding  receivable from
American  Transmission  Company  for work on the  Duluth-to-Wausau  transmission
line. This  receivable was paid in January 2005. Cash from operating  activities
in 2003 included the receipt of a $20.9 million  outstanding  receivable in 2002
related  to a  turbine  generator  sold  following  the  indefinite  delay  of a
generation  project in Superior,  Wisconsin.  Cash from operating  activities in
2002 included proceeds from the liquidation of our trading securities portfolio;
the proceeds were used to pay down short-term debt.

Cash from investing activities, excluding discontinued operations, was higher in
2004,  primarily  due to $12.0  million  received  from Split Rock  Energy  upon
termination  of the joint  venture and lower  additions to  property,  plant and
equipment, which vary from year to year depending on special projects. Additions
to property, plant and equipment in 2003 included expenses related to BNI Coal's
dragline  project;  2002 included  expenses  related to a generation  project in
Superior, Wisconsin.

Cash for financing  activities,  excluding  discontinued  operations,  reflected
significant  debt repayment in all periods  presented  ($183.1  million in 2004;
$431.5   million  in  2003;   $171.5   million  in  2002).   A  combination   of
internally-generated  funds, proceeds from the sale of our Water Services assets
in 2003 and 2004,  and proceeds  received  from ADESA in 2004 were used to repay
the debt in 2003 and 2004. See Note 8 for additional detail on debt repaid.  The
reduction in 2002 debt was  primarily  the  repayment of  commercial  paper with
proceeds from the liquidation of our trading securities portfolio.

WORKING CAPITAL.  Additional working capital,  if and when needed,  generally is
provided by the sale of commercial paper. Approximately 1 million original issue
shares of our common stock are available for issuance through INVEST DIRECT, our
direct  stock  purchase and dividend  reinvestment  plan.  We have bank lines of
credit  aggregating  $111.5  million,  the  majority of which expire in December
2007. These bank lines of credit provide credit support for our commercial paper
program.  The amount and timing of future  sales of our  securities  will depend
upon market  conditions and our specific  needs.  We may sell securities to meet
capital  requirements,  to provide for the  retirement  or early  redemption  of
issues of long-term  debt,  to reduce  short-term  debt and for other  corporate
purposes.

Our lines of credit and long-term  debt  agreements  contain  various  financial
covenants. The most restrictive of these covenants are discussed in Note 8.

SECURITIES

In March 2001, ALLETE, ALLETE Capital II and ALLETE Capital III, jointly filed a
registration  statement with the SEC,  pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities
Act of 1933. The registration  statement,  which has been declared  effective by
the SEC,  relates to the possible  issuance of a remaining  aggregate  amount of
$387  million of  securities,  which may  include  ALLETE  common  stock,  first
mortgage  bonds and other  debt  securities,  and  ALLETE  Capital II and ALLETE
Capital  III  preferred  trust  securities.   ALLETE  also  previously  filed  a
registration  statement,  which has been declared effective by the SEC, relating
to the possible  issuance of $25 million of first  mortgage bonds and other debt
securities.  We may sell all or a portion of the remaining registered securities
if warranted by market  conditions and our capital  requirements.  Any offer and
sale  of the  above  mentioned  securities  will  be made  only  by  means  of a
prospectus  meeting the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules
and regulations thereunder.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in Note 11.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

Our long-term debt  obligations,  including  long-term debt due within one year,
represent the principal  amount of bonds,  notes and loans which are recorded on
our consolidated  balance sheet, plus interest.  The following table assumes the
interest rate in effect at December 31, 2004 remains constant through  remaining
term.

Unconditional purchase obligations represent our Square Butte and Kendall County
power purchase agreements,  and minimum purchase commitments under coal and rail
contracts.

Under our power purchase  agreement with Square Butte that extends through 2026,
we are obligated to pay our pro rata share of Square  Butte's costs based on our
entitlement  to the output of Square Butte's 455 MW coal-fired  generating  unit
near Center,  North Dakota.  Our payment obligation is suspended if Square Butte
fails to deliver any power,  whether produced or purchased,  for a period of one
year.  Square Butte's fixed costs consist  primarily of debt service.  The table
below reflects our share of future debt service based on our output  entitlement
of  approximately  71% in 2005, 66% in 2006 and 60% thereafter.  Upon compliance
with a two-year  advance  notice  requirement,  Minnkota Power has the option to
reduce our entitlement by approximately  5% annually,  to a minimum of 50%. (See
Note 11.)

Under the  Kendall  County  agreement,  we pay a fixed  capacity  charge for the
right,  but not the  obligation,  to  utilize  one 275 MW  generating  unit near
Chicago,  Illinois. We are responsible for arranging the natural gas fuel supply
and are entitled to the electricity  produced. In December 2004, we entered into
an agreement to assign this power  purchase  agreement to  Constellation  Energy
Commodities. Pending certain approvals, the proposed transaction is scheduled to
close in April 2005. The following  table assumes the fixed capacity charge ends
April 1, 2005. (See Note 11.)

levels after 2005.

EMERGING  TECHNOLOGY  PORTFOLIO.  We have  investments in emerging  technologies
through the minority  investments in venture  capital funds and  privately-held,
start-up companies.  We have committed to make additional investments in certain
emerging  technology  holdings.  The total future commitment was $4.5 million at
December  31,  2004 ($4.8  million at December  31,  2003) and is expected to be
invested  at  various  times  through  2007.  We do not  have  plans to make any
additional investments beyond this commitment.

CREDIT RATINGS

Our  securities  have been rated by  Standard & Poor's  and by  Moody's.  Rating
agencies  use both  quantitative  and  qualitative  measures  in  determining  a
company's credit rating.  These measures include business risk,  liquidity risk,
competitive position,  capital mix, financial condition,  predictability of cash
flows,  management  strength  and  future  direction.  Some of the  quantitative
measures  can  be  analyzed  through  a few  key  financial  ratios,  while  the
qualitative ones are more subjective.  The disclosure of these credit ratings is
not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our securities. Ratings are subject to
revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning  rating  organization.  Each
rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

PAYOUT RATIO

In 2004, we paid out 77% (40% in 2003; 66% in 2002) of our per share earnings in
dividends.


CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

CONTINUING  OPERATIONS.  Capital  expenditures  for 2004 totaled  $63.0  million
($73.6 million in 2003;  $86.6 million in 2002).  Expenditures for 2004 included
$41.7  million for Regulated  Utility,  $15.7  million for  Nonregulated  Energy
Operations and $5.6 million for Other,  which  consisted of $5.2 million for our
telecommunications  business  and $0.4 million for general  corporate  purposes.
Except for BNI Coal's new  dragline,  which was funded with an operating  lease,
internally-generated funds were the source of funding for these expenditures.

Capital expenditures are expected to be $61 million in 2005 and total about $500
million for 2006 through 2009.  The 2005 amount  includes $48 million for system
component  replacement and upgrades within  Regulated  Utility,  $11 million for
system component  replacement and upgrades,  and coal handling  equipment within
Nonregulated Energy Operations and $2 million for telecommunication fiber within
Other.  We  expect  to  use  internally-generated  funds  to  fund  all  capital
expenditures.  Although the regulations have not yet been finalized,  we believe
that approximately half of the estimated  expenditures for 2006 through 2009 may
be necessary for environmental upgrades at our generation facilities.

DISCONTINUED  OPERATIONS.  Capital expenditures for discontinued  operations for
2004 totaled  $16.2 million  ($62.7  million in 2003;  $114.6  million in 2002).
Expenditures  for 2004 included  $13.1 million for Automotive  Services  capital
expenditures  incurred  prior to the September 2004 spin-off and $3.1 million to
maintain our remaining Water Services  businesses while they were in the process
of being sold.


ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS

As  previously  mentioned  in our  Critical  Accounting  Policies  section,  our
businesses  are  subject  to  regulation  by  various  federal,  state and local
authorities  concerning  environmental  matters.  We anticipate  that  potential
expenditures for  environmental  matters will be material in the future,  due to
stricter environmental  requirements through legislation and/or rulemakings that
are  expected  to  require  significant  capital  investments.  We are unable to
predict the outcome of the issues discussed in Note 11.


MARKET RISK

SECURITIES INVESTMENTS

Our securities  investments  include  certain  securities held for an indefinite
period  of time,  which  are  accounted  for as  available-for-sale  securities.
Available-for-sale  securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized  gains
and losses  included in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income,  net of tax.
Unrealized losses that are other than temporary are recognized in earnings.

ALLETE 2004 Form 10-K                                                    Page 34

<PAGE>

At December 31, 2004, our  available-for-sale  securities portfolio consisted of
securities in a grantor trust established to fund certain employee benefits. Our
available-for-sale  securities  portfolio  had a fair value of $30.2  million at
December 31, 2004 ($25.5  million at December  31, 2003) and a total  unrealized
after-tax  gain of $1.5 million at December  31, 2004 ($0.8  million at December
31,  2003).  We  use  the  specific  identification  method  as  the  basis  for
determining the cost of securities  sold. Our policy is to review on a quarterly
basis  available-for-sale  securities  for other than  temporary  impairment  by
assessing  such factors as the  continued  viability of products  offered,  cash
flow,  share  price  trends and the impact of overall  market  conditions.  As a
result of our periodic assessments,  we did not record any impairment write-down
on available-for-sale securities in 2004 or 2003.

As  part  of  our  emerging  technology  portfolio,  we  have  several  minority
investments in venture capital funds and direct  investments in  privately-held,
start-up companies. We account for our investment in venture capital funds under
the  equity  method and  account  for our direct  investment  in  privately-held
companies  under the cost  method.  The  total  carrying  value of our  emerging
technology  portfolio was $13.6 million at December 31, 2004, down $23.9 million
from December 31, 2003.  The decline was primarily due to a change to the equity
method of accounting for the venture capital funds (see Note 14) and impairments
related to investments  in  privately-held  companies.  Our basis in cost method
investments  included in the  emerging  technology  portfolio  was $4.5  million
($11.0 million in 2003). Our policy is to review these investments quarterly for
impairment  by  assessing  such  factors as  continued  commercial  viability of
products, cash flow and earnings. Any impairment would reduce the carrying value
of the investment. In 2004, we recorded $6.5 million ($4.1 million after tax) of
impairment  losses  related to direct  investments  in  certain  privately-held,
start-up   companies   whose   future   business   prospects   have   diminished
significantly.  Recent  developments  at these  companies  indicated that future
commercial  viability is  unlikely,  as is new  financing  necessary to continue
development.  We did not record any impairment loss on these investments in 2003
($1.5 million pretax in 2002).

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

Our regulated utility operations in Minnesota and Wisconsin incur costs for fuel
(primarily  coal),  power and natural gas  purchased for resale in our regulated
service  territories,  and  related  transportation.  Our  regulated  utilities'
exposure to price risk for these  commodities is significantly  mitigated by the
current ratemaking  process and regulatory  environment which generally allows a
fuel clause  surcharge  if costs are in excess of those in our last rate filing.
Conversely,  costs below those in our last rate filing  result in a rate credit.
We seek to prudently  manage our  customers'  exposure to price risk by entering
into contracts of various durations and terms for the purchase of coal and power
(in Minnesota), power and natural gas (in Wisconsin), and related transportation
costs.

POWER MARKETING

Our power marketing activities consist of (1) purchasing energy in the wholesale
market  for resale in our  regulated  service  territories  when  retail  energy
requirements   exceed  generation  output,  and  (2)  selling  excess  available
regulated   utility   generation  and  purchased   power,  as  well  as  selling
nonregulated generation.

From time to time, our regulated  utility  operations may have excess generation
that is  temporarily  not  required  by retail and  municipal  customers  in our
regulated service  territory.  We actively sell this generation to the wholesale
market to optimize the value of our generating  facilities.  This  generation is
generally  sold in the spot  market  or under  short-term  contracts  at  market
prices.

We have  approximately 500 MW of nonregulated  generation  available for sale to
the wholesale  markets.  This primarily consists of about 200 MW at our Taconite
Harbor  facility in  northern  Minnesota  and 275 MW obtained  through a 15-year
power purchase  agreement  with an  independent  power producer at a facility in
Kendall County near Chicago, Illinois.

Page 35                                                    ALLETE 2004 Form 10-K

<PAGE>

Taconite  Harbor's  capability  of  approximately  200 MW has been sold  through
various short-term and long-term  capacity and energy contracts.  Short term, we
have  approximately 116 MW of capacity and energy sales contracts,  all of which
expire on April 30,  2005.  Long term,  we have  entered  into two  capacity and
energy sales contracts  totaling 175 MW (201 MW including a 15% reserve),  which
are effective May 1, 2005 and expire on April 30, 2010.  Both contracts  contain
fixed monthly  capacity  charges and fixed minimum energy charges.  One contract
provides for an annual  escalator to the energy charge based on increases in our
cost of coal, subject to a small minimum annual  escalation.  The other contract
provides that the energy charge will be the greater of a fixed minimum charge or
an amount based on the variable production cost of a combined-cycle, natural gas
unit.  Our  exposure  in the event of a full or partial  outage at our  Taconite
Harbor facility is significantly limited under both contracts. When the buyer is
notified at least two months prior to an outage,  there is no exposure.  Outages
with less than two months' notice are subject to an annual  duration  limitation
typical of this type of contract. We also have a 50 MW capacity and energy sales
contract that extends  through April 2008 and a 15 MW energy sales contract that
extends through May 2007. The 50 MW capacity and energy sales contract has fixed
pricing through January 2006 and market-based pricing thereafter.

Under the Kendall County  agreement,  which expires in September  2017, we pay a
fixed capacity  charge for the right,  but not the  obligation,  to capacity and
energy from a 275-MW  generating  unit.  We are  responsible  for  arranging the
natural gas fuel supply. To date, this power purchase  agreement has resulted in
losses to us due to negative spark spreads (the  differential  between  electric
and  natural  gas  prices)  in the  wholesale  power  market  and our  resulting
inability to cover the fixed capacity charge on the unsold  capacity  (currently
145 MW). To eliminate ongoing losses from generation secured through the Kendall
County agreement,  in December 2004, we entered into an agreement to assign this
power purchase agreement to Constellation  Energy  Commodities.  Pending certain
approvals,  the  transaction  is scheduled to close in April 2005.  We currently
have  approximately 130 MW of long-term capacity sales contracts for the Kendall
County  generation,  which  will also be  transferred  to  Constellation  Energy
Commodities at closing.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

READERS ARE CAUTIONED THAT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE CONTAINED
IN THIS FORM 10-K,  SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR DISCLOSURES UNDER THE
HEADING:  "SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES  LITIGATION REFORM
ACT OF 1995"  LOCATED  ON PAGE 3 OF THIS  FORM  10-K AND THE  FACTORS  DESCRIBED
BELOW. THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES  DESCRIBED IN THIS FORM 10-K ARE NOT THE ONLY
ONES FACING OUR  COMPANY.  ADDITIONAL  RISKS AND  UNCERTAINTIES  THAT WE ARE NOT
PRESENTLY AWARE OF, OR THAT WE CURRENTLY  CONSIDER  IMMATERIAL,  MAY ALSO AFFECT
OUR  BUSINESS  OPERATIONS.  OUR  BUSINESS,  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  OR  RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS  COULD SUFFER IF THE CONCERNS  SET FORTH BELOW ARE  REALIZED.

IF OUR SIGNIFICANT  CUSTOMERS ARE NEGATIVELY  IMPACTED BY WORLD  ECONOMICS,  OUR
REVENUE MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

Our  industrial  customers  are  impacted by world  economics  that affect their
competitive position and profitability.  Taconite producers,  and paper and wood
products  customers served by Minnesota Power compete in this world marketplace.
Their inability to compete in their global markets could have a material adverse
effect on their  operations  and  continuation  as a business.  Any such failure
could have a  material  adverse  effect on our  results  of  operations  and the
communities we serve.

OUR ENERGY BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO INCREASED COMPETITION.

The independent power industry includes numerous strong and capable competitors,
many of which  have  extensive  experience  in the  operation,  acquisition  and
development of power generation  facilities.  Our competition is based primarily
on price and  reputation  for  quality,  safety and  reliability.  The  electric
utility and natural gas industries are also experiencing  increased  competitive
pressures as a result of consumer demands, technological advances, deregulation,
greater availability of natural gas-fired generation and other factors.

ALLETE 2004 Form 10-K                                                    Page 36

<PAGE>

WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE  GOVERNMENTAL  REGULATIONS  THAT MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE
IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

We are subject to  prevailing  governmental  policies  and  regulatory  actions,
including those of the United States Congress, state legislatures, the FERC, the
MPUC,  the FPSC,  the PSCW,  and various local and county  regulators,  and city
administrators.  These  governmental  regulations  relate  to  allowed  rates of
return,  financings,  industry and rate  structure,  acquisition and disposal of
assets and facilities,  real estate  development,  operation and construction of
plant  facilities,  recovery of  purchased  power and capital  investments,  and
present or  prospective  wholesale  and retail  competition  (including  but not
limited to transmission  costs).  These governmental  regulations  significantly
influence our operating  environment and may affect our ability to recover costs
from our  customers.  We are required to have  numerous  permits,  approvals and
certificates  from the  agencies  that  regulate  our  business.  We believe the
necessary  permits,  approvals and certificates  have been obtained for existing
operations  and that our  business is conducted in  accordance  with  applicable
laws; however, we are unable to predict the impact on operating results from the
future regulatory activities of any of these agencies. Changes in regulations or
the  imposition of additional  regulations  could have an adverse  impact on our
results of operations.

OUR  REGULATED   UTILITY  AND  NONREGULATED   ENERGY   OPERATIONS  POSE  CERTAIN
ENVIRONMENTAL  RISKS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY  AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION.

We are subject to extensive  environmental  laws and regulations  affecting many
aspects of our present  and future  operations,  including  air  quality,  water
quality, waste management,  reclamation and other environmental  considerations.
These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating, and other
costs,  as a result  of  compliance,  remediation,  containment  and  monitoring
obligations, particularly with regard to laws relating to power plant emissions.
These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide
variety of  environmental  licenses,  permits,  inspections and other approvals.
Both public  officials and private  individuals  may seek to enforce  applicable
environmental  laws  and  regulations.   We  cannot  predict  the  financial  or
operational outcome of any related litigation that may arise.

There are no assurances  that  existing  environmental  regulations  will not be
revised or that new regulations  seeking to protect the environment  will not be
adopted or become  applicable to us.  Revised or additional  regulations,  which
result in  increased  compliance  costs or  additional  operating  restrictions,
particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from customers, could have
a material effect on our results of operations.

We cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of all future expenditures
related to  environmental  matters  because of the difficulty of estimating such
costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying  liabilities under environmental
laws that impose  joint and several  liability  on all  potentially  responsible
parties. (See Note 11.)

THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF OUR  GENERATING  FACILITIES INVOLVES RISKS THAT
COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS.

The operation of generating  facilities involves many risks,  including start-up
risks,  breakdown  or  failure  of  facilities,  lack of  sufficient  capital to
maintain the facilities, the dependence on a specific fuel source, or the impact
of unusual or adverse weather conditions or other natural events, as well as the
risk  of  performance  below  expected  levels  of  output  or  efficiency,  the
occurrence  of any of  which  could  result  in lost  revenue  and/or  increased
expenses.  A significant portion of Minnesota Power's facilities was constructed
many years ago. In particular, older generating equipment, even if maintained in
accordance with good  engineering  practices,  may require  significant  capital
expenditures  to keep it operating at peak  efficiency.  This  equipment is also
likely to require periodic  upgrading and improvement.  Minnesota Power could be
subject to costs  associated  with any  unexpected  failure  to  produce  power,
including  failure  caused by breakdown or forced  outage,  as well as repairing
damage to facilities due to storms, natural disasters,  wars, terrorist acts and
other  catastrophic  events.  Further,  our ability to  successfully  and timely
complete capital  improvements to existing  facilities or other capital projects
is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial  risks.  Should any
such efforts be unsuccessful, we could be subject to additional costs and/or the
write-off of our investment in the project or improvement.

WE MUST HAVE ADEQUATE  AND RELIABLE TRANSMISSION AND  DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES TO
DELIVER OUR ELECTRICITY TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

Minnesota Power depends on transmission  and  distribution  facilities owned and
operated by other utilities, as well as its own such facilities,  to deliver the
electricity it produces and sells to its  customers,  as well as to other energy
suppliers.  If  transmission  capacity  is  inadequate,  our ability to sell and
deliver  electricity may be hindered,  we may have to forgo sales or we may have
to  buy  more  expensive   wholesale   electricity  that  is  available  in  the
capacity-constrained  area. The cost to provide  service to these  customers may
exceed the cost to serve other customers,  resulting in lower gross margins.  In
addition,  any  infrastructure  failure that  interrupts or impairs  delivery of
electricity to our customers  could  negatively  impact the  satisfaction of our
customers with our service.

Page 37                                                    ALLETE 2004 Form 10-K

<PAGE>

THE PRICE OF ONE OF OUR MAJOR  PRODUCTS,  ELECTRICITY,  AND/OR  ONE OF OUR MAJOR
EXPENSES, FUEL, MAY BE VOLATILE.

Volatility in market prices for electricity and fuel may result from:

  -  severe or unexpected weather conditions;
  -  seasonality;
  -  changes in electricity usage;
  -  the current diminished liquidity in the wholesale power markets, as well as
     any future illiquidity in these or other markets;
  -  transmission    or    transportation    constraints,    inoperability    or
     inefficiencies;
  -  availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources;
  -  changes in supply and demand for energy commodities;
  -  changes in power production capacity;
  -  outages at  Minnesota Power's   generating   facilities or   those of   our
     competitors;
  -  changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal, and
     crude oil and refined products;
  -  natural disasters, wars, sabotage, terrorist  acts and  other  catastrophic
     events; and
  -  federal, state, local  and  foreign  energy,   environmental,   and   other
     regulation and legislation.

Since  fluctuations in fuel expense related to our regulated utility  operations
are passed on to customers through our fuel clause, risk of volatility in market
prices for fuel and electricity  mainly impacts our  nonregulated  operations at
this time.

WE ARE DEPENDENT ON GOOD LABOR RELATIONS.

We believe our  relations  to be good with our  approximately  1,500  employees.
Approximately  700 of these  employees  are members of either the  International
Brotherhood  of  Electrical   Workers  Local  31  or  Local  1593.   Failure  to
successfully renegotiate labor agreements could adversely affect the services we
provide and our results of operations. The labor agreements with Local 31 expire

A DOWNTURN  IN  ECONOMIC  CONDITIONS  COULD  ADVERSELY  AFFECT  OUR REAL  ESTATE
BUSINESS.

The ability of our real estate business to generate  revenue is directly related
to the Florida real estate  market,  the national and local  economy in general,
and changes in interest rates. While real estate market conditions have remained
healthy in our regions of development, continued demand for land is dependent on
long-term prospects for strong, in-migration population expansion.

Over the last several years, investors have increasingly utilized real estate as
an investment.  Florida real estate has particularly  benefited from this trend,
creating  demand for our land. If this trend were to lessen,  the demand for our
land could decline, potentially impacting selling prices.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT.

Our real estate  development  activities entail risks that include  construction
delays or cost overruns, which may increase project development costs.

In addition,  our real estate development activities require significant capital
expenditures.  We obtain  funds for our capital  expenditures  through cash flow
from operations and financings.  We cannot be sure that the funds available from
these  sources  will be  sufficient  to fund our  required  or  desired  capital
expenditures for development.  If we are unable to obtain  sufficient  funds, we
may have to defer or  otherwise  limit  our  development  activities.  If we are
unsuccessful in our selling efforts, we may not be able to recover these capital
expenditures.

OUR REAL ESTATE  BUSINESS  IS SUBJECT TO  EXTENSIVE  REGULATION,  WHICH MAKES IT
DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE FOR US TO CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS.

Development of real property in Florida  entails an extensive  approval  process
involving  overlapping  regulatory  jurisdictions.  Real  estate  projects  must
generally  comply  with the  provisions  of the Local  Government  Comprehensive
Planning  and Land  Development  Regulation  Act  (Growth  Management  Act).  In
addition,   development   projects  that  exceed  certain  specified  regulatory
thresholds  require  approval of a comprehensive  Development of Regional Impact
(DRI) application. Compliance with the Growth Management Act and the DRI process
is usually lengthy and costly and can be expected to materially  affect our real
estate development activities.

ALLETE 2004 Form 10-K                                                    Page 38

<PAGE>

The Growth  Management Act requires  counties and cities to adopt  comprehensive
plans  guiding  and  controlling  future  real  property  development  in  their
respective  jurisdictions.  After a local  government  adopts its  comprehensive
plan, all development orders and development permits must be consistent with the
plan.  Each  plan  must  address  such  topics  as  future  land  use,   capital
improvements, traffic circulation, sanitation, sewerage, potable water, drainage
and solid waste disposal.  The local governments'  comprehensive plans must also
establish   "levels  of  service"  with  respect  to  certain  specified  public
facilities and services to residents.  Local  governments  are  prohibited  from
issuing  development  orders or  permits  if  facilities  and  services  are not
operating at established levels of service, or if the projects for which permits
are requested will reduce the level of service for public  facilities  below the
level of service  established in the local government's  comprehensive  plan. If
the proposed  development  would reduce the established  level of services below
the level set by the plan,  the  development  order will  require  that,  at the
outset of the project, the developer either sufficiently improve the services to
meet the required  level or provide  financial  assurances  that the  additional
services will be provided as the project progresses.

The Growth  Management  Act, in some  instances,  can  significantly  affect the
ability of developers to obtain local  government  approval in Florida.  In many
areas,  infrastructure  funding  has not kept  pace  with  growth.  As a result,
substandard  facilities  and  services  can delay or  prevent  the  issuance  of
permits.  Consequently,  the Growth  Management Act could  adversely  affect our
ability to develop our real estate projects.

The DRI review  process  includes an  evaluation  of a  project's  impact on the
environment,   infrastructure   and  government   services,   and  requires  the
involvement  of numerous  state and local  environmental,  zoning and  community
development agencies.  Local government approval of any DRI is subject to appeal
to the Governor and Cabinet by the Florida Department of Community Affairs,  and
adverse decisions by the Governor or Cabinet are subject to judicial appeal. The
DRI approval process is usually lengthy and costly, and conditions, standards or
requirements may be imposed on a developer with respect to a particular project,
which may materially increase the cost of the project.  The DRI approval process
is expected to have a material impact on our real estate development  activities
in the future.

ENVIRONMENTAL  AND  OTHER  REGULATIONS  MAY HAVE AN  ADVERSE  EFFECT ON OUR REAL
ESTATE BUSINESS.

A  substantial  portion of our  development  properties in Florida is subject to
federal,   state,  and  local  regulations  and  restrictions  that  may  impose
significant costs or limitations on our ability to develop our properties.  Much
of our  property is vacant  land and some is located in areas where  development
may affect the natural  habitats  of various  protected  wildlife  species or in
sensitive environmental areas such as wetlands.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE REVENUE
AND EARNINGS.

The energy industry is considered a mature  industry in which low,  single-digit
growth is expected  in  industry  unit  sales.  Accordingly,  our future  growth
depends in large part on our  ability to increase  our  volumes  relative to our
competition,  acquire additional businesses,  replenish land inventories for our
real  estate  business,  manage  expansion,  control  costs  in our  operations,
introduce  new  services  and  consolidate  future  acquisitions  into  existing
operations.  In pursuing a strategy of acquiring other businesses, we face risks
commonly encountered with growth through acquisitions.  These risks include, but
are not limited to:

  -  incurring significantly higher capital expenditures and operating expenses;
  -  failing  to  assimilate  the  operations  and  personnel  of  the  acquired
     businesses;
  -  entering new, unfamiliar markets;
  -  potential undiscovered liabilities at acquired businesses;
  -  disrupting our ongoing business;
  -  diverting our limited management resources;
  -  failing to maintain uniform standards, controls and policies;
  -  impairing relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes
     in management; and
  -  increasing  expenses  for  accounting  and  computer  systems,  as  well as
     integration difficulties.

We may not adequately  anticipate all of the demands that our growth will impose
on our systems, procedures and structures, including our financial and reporting
control systems, data processing systems and management structure.  If we cannot
adequately  anticipate  and  respond to these  demands,  our  business  could be
materially harmed.

Although  we  conduct  what we believe  to be a prudent  level of  investigation
regarding the operating condition of the businesses we purchase, in light of the
circumstances  of  each  transaction,  an  unavoidable  level  of  risk  remains
regarding the actual operating condition of these businesses.  Until we actually
assume  operating  control  of  such  business  assets,  we may  not be  able to
ascertain the actual value of the acquired entity.

Page 39                                                    ALLETE 2004 Form 10-K

<PAGE>

WE CAN OFFER YOU NO  ASSURANCES  THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EXECUTE AN  ACQUISITION
STRATEGY WITHOUT THE COSTS OF FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ESCALATING.

Although there are potential  acquisition  candidates  that fit our  acquisition
criteria,  we are not  certain  that we will  be  able to  consummate  any  such
transactions in the future or identify those candidates that would result in the
most successful  combinations,  or that future  acquisitions  will be able to be
consummated at acceptable prices and terms. In addition,  increased  competition
for acquisition  candidates could result in fewer acquisition  opportunities for
us and higher acquisition prices. The magnitude,  timing,  pricing and nature of
future acquisitions will depend upon various factors, including:

  -  the availability of suitable acquisition candidates;
  -  competition with other industry  groups or new  industry consolidators  for
     suitable acquisitions;
  -  the negotiation of acceptable terms;
  -  our financial capabilities;
  -  the availability of skilled employees to manage the acquired companies; and
  -  general economic and business conditions.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD BE REVISED DOWNWARD.

The current credit ratings for our long-term debt are investment grade. A rating
reflects only the view of a rating  agency,  and it is not a  recommendation  to
buy, sell or hold  securities.  Any rating can be revised  upward or downward at
any time by a rating  agency if such rating  agency  decides that  circumstances
warrant such a change.  If Standard & Poor's or Moody's  were to  downgrade  our
long-term ratings,  particularly  below investment grade,  borrowing costs would
increase and the potential  pool of investors  and funding  sources would likely
decrease.

WE RELY HEAVILY ON TECHNOLOGY TO AUTOMATE AND MAXIMIZE THE  EFFICIENCIES  OF OUR
BUSINESSES.  TECHNOLOGY  IS  CONSTANTLY  EVOLVING  AND IN ORDER FOR US TO REMAIN
COMPETITIVE  WE WILL  EMBRACE NEW  TECHNOLOGIES  AS THEY  BECOME  PROVEN AND ARE
ECONOMICALLY VIABLE.

Technology is an integral part of the operating and administrative  functions of
our  businesses.  The  information  systems and  processes  necessary to support
business areas such as risk management, sales, customer service, and procurement
and supply are complex and are constantly  evolving.  To successfully compete in
our businesses,  we must adapt to the evolving  market by continually  improving
the responsiveness,  functionality,  and features of our services and systems to
meet our customers' and other stakeholders' needs.  Increased automation through
proven,  economically viable technologies is among the primary tools that we use
to enhance our competitive position; without these technologies,  our businesses
would not be able to safely operate or adequately  respond to customer and other
stakeholder needs.

TAX  RESERVES  AND  THE  RECOVERABILITY  OF OUR  DEFERRED TAX  ASSETS MAY HAVE A
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

We are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various
financial transactions and our ongoing operations to estimate our obligations to
taxing  authorities.  These tax obligations include income, real estate, use and
employment-related taxes. These judgments include reserves for potential adverse
outcomes  regarding  tax positions  that we have taken.  We must also assess our
ability to  generate  capital  gains to realize  tax  benefits  associated  with
capital losses expected to be generated in future periods. Capital losses may be
deducted  only to the extent of capital  gains  realized  during the year of the
loss or during the three prior or five  succeeding  years.  As of  December  31,
2004, we have, where appropriate, recorded an allowance against our deferred tax
assets associated with impairment losses,  which will become capital losses when
realized for income tax  purposes.  The ultimate  outcome of such matters  could
result  in  adjustments  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  such
adjustments could be material.

ADEQUATE INSURANCE PROTECTION MAY NOT BE COST EFFECTIVE OR AVAILABLE TO MINIMIZE
RISK.

Insurance,  warranties or performance guarantees may not cover any or all of the
lost revenue or increased  expenses,  including the cost of  replacement  power.
Likewise, our ability to obtain insurance, and the cost of and coverage provided
by such insurance, could be affected by events outside our control.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RETAIN OUR EXECUTIVE  OFFICERS AND KEY  EMPLOYEES,  WE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER.

The success of our business  heavily  depends on the leadership of our executive
officers,  all of whom are employees-at-will and none of whom are subject to any
agreements  not to  compete.  If we  lose  the  service  of one or  more  of our
executive officers or key employees, or if one or more of them decides to join a
competitor or otherwise  compete  directly or indirectly  with us, we may not be
able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives.  We
may have  difficulty  in retaining  and  attracting  customers,  developing  new
services,   negotiating   favorable  agreements  with  customers  and  providing
acceptable levels of customer service.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial  reporting,  as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(f).  Under the supervision and with the  participation of our management,
including our principal  executive officer and principal  financial officer,  we
conducted  an  evaluation  of the  effectiveness  of our  internal  control over
financial  reporting  based on the  framework  in  Internal  Control--Integrated
Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations  of the Treadway
Commission.   Based  on  our   evaluation   under  the   framework  in  Internal
Control--Integrated  Framework,  our  management  concluded  that  our  internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004.

Our  management's  assessment of the  effectiveness of our internal control over
financial   reporting   as  of  December   31,   2004,   has  been   audited  by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein.


ITEM 9B.   OTHER INFORMATION

On December 14, 2004,  ALLETE entered into a committed,  syndicated,  unsecured,
revolving  credit  facility with LaSalle  Bank,  National  Association  for $100
million  (Line).  The Line matures on December 14, 2007. The Line may be used by
ALLETE for general corporate purposes,  working capital and to provide liquidity
in support of the ALLETE's  commercial paper program.  ALLETE may prepay amounts
outstanding under the Line in whole or in part at its discretion.  Additionally,
ALLETE  may  irrevocably  terminate  or  reduce  the size of the  Line  prior to
maturity.

ALLETE has agreed to certain  financial  covenants related to the Line. The most
restrictive covenants require ALLETE (1) to not exceed a maximum ratio of funded
debt to total capital of .65 to 1.00;  and (2) to maintain an interest  coverage
ratio of not less than  3.00 to 1.00.  The Line also  contains  a  cross-default
provision,  under  which an  event  of  default  would  arise  if  other  ALLETE
obligations in excess of $5.0 million were in default. (See Note 8.)

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of ALLETE, Inc.:

We have  completed  an  integrated  audit of ALLETE,  Inc.'s  2004  consolidated
financial  statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December  31,  2004 and  audits  of its 2003  and  2002  consolidated  financial
statements in accordance  with the  standards of the Public  Company  Accounting
Oversight  Board  (United  States).  Our  opinions,  based  on our  audits,  are
presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
------------------------------------------------------------------

In our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  listed  in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(1)  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the
financial  position  of ALLETE,  Inc. at  December  31,  2004 and 2003,  and the
results  of  its  operations and its cash flows for each of the three  years  in
the period ended  December 31, 2004 in  conformity  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial  statement  schedule listed in the  accompanying  index under Item
15(a)(2)  presents fairly, in all material  respects,  the information set forth
therein  when  read in  conjunction  with  the  related  consolidated  financial
statements.  These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial  statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits.  We conducted our audits of these  statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board (United  States).
Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit of financial  statements includes  examining,  on a test
basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial
statements,  assessing the accounting  principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 14 to the financial statements, in 2004 the Company changed
its method of  accounting  for  investments  in limited  liability  companies in
accordance with EITF 03-16,  "Accounting  for  Investments in Limited  Liability
Companies."

Internal control over financial reporting
-----------------------------------------

Also, in our opinion,  management's assessment,  included in Management's Report
on Internal Control Over Financial  Reporting  appearing under Item 9A, that the
Company  maintained  effective  internal control over financial  reporting as of
December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal  Control--Integrated
Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations  of the Treadway
Commission  (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material  respects,  based on those
criteria.  Furthermore,  in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, based on criteria  established in Internal  Control--Integrated  Framework
issued by the COSO.  The Company's  management is  responsible  for  maintaining
effective  internal  control over financial  reporting and for its assessment of
the   effectiveness   of  internal   control  over  financial   reporting.   Our
responsibility  is to express  opinions on  management's  assessment  and on the
effectiveness of the Company's  internal control over financial  reporting based
on our  audit.  We  conducted  our  audit of  internal  control  over  financial
reporting in  accordance  with the  standards of the Public  Company  Accounting
Oversight  Board  (United  States).  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform  the  audit to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all  material
respects.  An  audit of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes
obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,
evaluating  management's  assessment,  testing  and  evaluating  the  design and
operating   effectiveness  of  internal  control,   and  performing  such  other
procedures as we consider  necessary in the  circumstances.  We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's  internal control over financial  reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting
and the preparation of financial  statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial  reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the  maintenance  of records that, in reasonable  detail,  accurately and fairly
reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions of the assets of the company;  (ii)
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company;  and (iii) provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or
timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 2.    OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREPARATION. References  in  this  report to "we," "us"  and
"our" are to ALLETE and its subsidiaries, collectively. We prepare our financial
statements in conformity with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
United States of America.  These principles  require management to make informed
judgments,  best estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of
assets,  liabilities,  revenue and  expenses.  Actual  results could differ from
those estimates.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. Our consolidated financial statements  include  the
accounts  of ALLETE  and all of our  majority-owned  subsidiary  companies.  All
material   intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated  in
consolidation.  Information  for prior periods has been  reclassified to present
comparable information for all periods.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. Our Regulated Utility,  Nonregulated  Energy  Operations  and
Real Estate segments were determined based on products and services provided. We
measure  performance of our operations  through careful budgeting and monitoring
of  contributions   to  consolidated  net  income  by  each  business   segment.
Discontinued  Operations includes our Automotive Services business that was spun
off in September 2004, our Water Services businesses, the majority of which were
sold in 2003,  costs  associated  with the spin-off of ADESA incurred by ALLETE,
and our retail stores, which we exited in 2002.

REGULATED UTILITY includes retail and wholesale rate-regulated  electric,  water
and gas services in northeastern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin. Minnesota
Power, an operating  division of ALLETE,  and SWL&P, a wholly-owned  subsidiary,
provide  regulated  utility  electric  service to 150,000  retail  customers  in
northeastern  Minnesota  and  northwestern   Wisconsin.   Approximately  45%  of
regulated  utility  electric  revenue  is from  Large  Power  Customers  (32% of
consolidated revenue). Large Power Customers consist of five taconite producers,
four paper and pulp mills,  two pipeline  companies and one  manufacturer  under
all-requirements  contracts with  expiration  dates extending from February 2006
through April 2009. Revenue of $88.3 million (11.8% of consolidated revenue) was
received  from one  taconite  producer in 2004 (less than 10% in 2003 and 2002).
Regulated  utility rates are under the jurisdiction of various state and federal
regulatory  authorities.  Billings  are  rendered on a cycle  basis.  Revenue is
accrued for service  provided but not billed.  Regulated  utility electric rates
include  adjustment clauses that bill or credit customers for fuel and purchased
energy  costs  above or below the base  levels in rate  schedules  and that bill
retail  customers  for the recovery of CIP  expenditures  not  collected in base
rates.

Minnesota  Power  withdrew  from Split Rock Energy,  a joint  venture with Great
River Energy, in 2004. Upon withdrawal, we received a $12.0 million distribution
in 2004. We accounted for our 50% ownership  interest in Split Rock Energy under
the equity  method of  accounting.  For the year ended  December 31,  2004,  our
pre-tax  equity  income from Split Rock Energy was less than $0.1 million  ($2.9
million in 2003;  $7.3 million in 2002). In 2004,  prior to our  withdrawal,  we
made power  purchases  from Split Rock Energy of $6.2 million  ($50.9 million in
2003;  $34.3  million  in 2002) and  power  sales to Split  Rock  Energy of $1.9
million ($19.6 million in 2003; $14.5 million in 2002).

NONREGULATED ENERGY OPERATIONS includes  nonregulated  generation (non-rate base
generation  sold at  market-based  rates to the  wholesale  market),  consisting
primarily  of  generation  from  Taconite  Harbor  in  northern   Minnesota  and
generation secured through the Kendall County power purchase agreement.  Subject
to certain approvals, we expect to transfer the Kendall power purchase agreement
to  Constellation  Energy  Commodities in April 2005. (See Note 11.) Revenue for
nonregulated  generation is recognized under terms of contracts and as energy is
delivered.   Nonregulated  Energy  Operations  also  includes  our  coal  mining
activities in North Dakota. BNI Coal, a wholly-owned subsidiary, mines and sells
lignite coal to two North Dakota  mine-mouth  generating  units, one of which is
Square Butte. Square Butte supplies  approximately 71% (323 MW) of its output to
Minnesota  Power  under a  long-term  contract.  (See Note  11.) Coal  sales are
recognized when delivered at the cost of production plus a specified  profit per
ton of coal delivered.

REAL  ESTATE  includes  our  Florida  real  estate  operations.  Our real estate
operations  include several  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  and an 80% ownership in
Lehigh  Acquisition  Corporation,  which are consolidated in ALLETE's  financial
statements.  All of our Florida real estate companies are principally engaged in
real estate  acquisitions,  development  and sales.  Full profit  recognition is
recorded on sales upon closing,  provided cash  collections  are at least 20% of
the contract price and the other  requirements of SFAS 66, "Accounting for Sales
of Real Estate," are met. Costs of real estate sales include  capitalized  costs
incurred since  acquisition and the allocated cost of the underlying real estate
determined at  acquisition.  Land held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost
or fair value determined by the evaluation of individual land parcels.

OTHER  includes  our  telecommunications  activities,  investments  in  emerging
technologies  related to the electric  utility  industry,  earnings on cash, and
general  corporate  charges and  interest  not  specifically  related to any one
business  segment.  General  corporate  charges  include  employee  salaries and
benefits,  as well as legal and other outside service fees.  Enventis Telecom, a
wholly-owned  subsidiary,  is  our  telecommunications  business,  which  is  an
integrated data services provider  offering fiber optic-based  communication and
advanced data services to businesses and communities in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Revenue is generally  recognized  when  equipment is delivered and when services
are completed under  short-term  contracts.  Revenue from  fiber-optic  sales is
recognized under the straight-line basis for contracts over 12 months.

Other included Operation and Other Expense totaling $12.6 million in 2004 ($14.8
million in 2003; $17.0 million in 2002) for general  corporate  expenses such as
employee  salaries and benefits,  and legal and other outside  contract  service
fees,  and  Interest  Expense of $11.2  million in 2004 ($28.0  million in 2003;
$28.2 million in 2002).

<PAGE>

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. Property, plant  and  equipment  are  recorded at
original  cost  and  are  reported  on the  balance  sheet  net  of  accumulated
depreciation.  Expenditures  for  additions  and  significant  replacements  and
improvements  are  capitalized;  maintenance  and repair  costs are  expensed as
incurred.  Expenditures  for major plant  overhauls are also accounted for using
this same policy. Gains or losses on nonregulated property,  plant and equipment
are  recognized  when they are retired or otherwise  disposed of. When regulated
utility property,  plant and equipment are retired or otherwise  disposed of, no
gain or loss is  recognized.  Our  Regulated  Utility  operations  capitalize an
allowance for funds used during  construction,  which  includes both an interest
and equity component. Our other operations capitalize interest during the course
of a construction project.

LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS. We annually review our assets for impairment. SFAS
144,  "Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets," is the
basis for these analyses.  Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application
of accounting for asset impairment include economic conditions  affecting market
valuations,  changes in our  business  strategy,  and changes in our forecast of
future operating cash flows and earnings.

We  account  for  our  long-lived  assets  at  depreciated  historical  cost.  A
long-lived  asset is tested  for  recoverability  whenever  events or changes in
circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. We would
recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying  amount of a long-lived  asset
is not recoverable  from its  undiscounted  cash flows.  Management  judgment is
involved in both  deciding if testing for  recoverability  is  necessary  and in
estimating undiscounted cash flows. As of December 31, 2004, no write-downs were
required.

ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE.  Accounts receivable are reported on the balance sheet net
of an allowance for doubtful accounts.  The allowance is based on our evaluation
of the receivable portfolio under current conditions, the size of the portfolio,
overall  portfolio  quality,  review of specific problems and such other factors
that, in our judgment, deserve recognition in estimating losses.

UNAMORTIZED EXPENSE, DISCOUNT AND PREMIUM ON DEBT. Expense, discount and premium
on debt are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related issues.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. We consider all investments purchased with maturities
of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

RESTRICTED  CASH. We sponsor a leveraged ESOP as part of our Retirement  Savings
and Stock  Ownership  Plan.  The ESOP had $30.3 million in cash,  which is being
used to purchase  ALLETE common stock on the open market.  We reflected the cash
held by the ESOP as Restricted Cash on our consolidated balance sheet. (See Note
17.)

ACCOUNTING  FOR  STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION.  We  have  elected  to  account  for
stock-based compensation under the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB
Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees."  Accordingly,  we
recognize  expense for  performance  share awards  granted and do not  recognize
expense for employee stock options granted. The after-tax expense recognized for
performance  share  awards was  approximately  $1 million in 2004 ($3 million in
2003). The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per
share if we had  applied  the fair  value  recognition  provisions  of SFAS 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."

</TABLE>

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES. We review environmental matters on a quarterly basis.
Accruals  for  environmental  matters are  recorded  when it is probable  that a
liability  has been  incurred and the amount of the  liability can be reasonably
estimated,  based on current law and existing  technologies.  These accruals are
adjusted  periodically  as assessment  and  remediation  efforts  progress or as
additional  technical  or legal  information  becomes  available.  Accruals  for
environmental  liabilities  are  included in the balance  sheet at  undiscounted
amounts and exclude claims for recoveries from insurance or other third parties.
Costs related to environmental  contamination  treatment and cleanup are charged
to expense.

INCOME TAXES. We file a consolidated federal income tax return. Income taxes are
allocated  to each  subsidiary  based on their  taxable  income.  We account for
income taxes using the liability  method as prescribed by SFAS 109,  "Accounting
for Income Taxes." Under the liability  method,  deferred income tax liabilities
are  established  for all  temporary  differences  in the book and tax  basis of
assets and liabilities,  based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the
periods in which the taxes become  payable.  Due to the effects of regulation on
Minnesota Power, certain adjustments made to deferred income taxes are, in turn,
recorded as regulatory  assets or liabilities.  Investment tax credits have been
recorded as deferred  credits and are being amortized to income tax expense over
the service lives of the related property.

EXCISE TAXES.  We collect  excise taxes from our customers  levied by government
entities.  These taxes are stated  separately on the billing to the customer and
recorded as a liability to be remitted to the government  entity. We account for
the  collection  and  payment of these  taxes on the net basis and  neither  the
amounts collected or paid are reflected on our consolidated statement of income.

NEW  ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS.  In December  2004,  the FASB  issued  SFAS  123(R),
"Share-Based  Payment,"  which will be effective  for public  entities as of the
first interim or annual  reporting  period that begins after June 15, 2005. SFAS
123(R)  replaces  SFAS  123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation,"  and
supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to Employees." The
new standard requires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment
be recognized in financial statements at fair value. As such, reporting employee
stock options under the intrinsic  value-based  method prescribed by APB 25 will
no longer be allowed.  We have  historically  elected to use the intrinsic value
method and have not recognized  expense for employee stock options  granted.  We
estimate  that  the  impact  of  adoption  of SFAS  123(R)  in  2005  will be an
additional  expense of  approximately  $0.2  million  after tax. We also have an
Employee  Stock  Purchase Plan that provides a discount of 5% from market price.
Current accounting rules do not require the recognition of compensation  expense
for employee stock  purchase plans such as ours, and SFAS 123(R)  continues this
exception.


NOTE 3.    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES.  On September 20, 2004, the spin-off of Automotive Services
was completed by distributing to ALLETE  shareholders  all of ALLETE's shares of
ADESA common  stock.  One share of ADESA common stock was  distributed  for each
outstanding  share of ALLETE  common  stock held at the close of business on the
September 13, 2004 record date. The distribution was made from ALLETE's retained
earnings to the extent of ADESA's undistributed earnings ($363.4 million),  with
the remainder made from common stock ($600.2 million).

In June 2004,  ADESA issued 6.3 million  shares of common  stock  through an IPO
priced at $24.00  per share,  which  netted  proceeds  of $136.0  million  after
transaction costs, issued $125 million of senior notes and borrowed $275 million
under a new $525  million  credit  facility.  With  these  funds,  ADESA  repaid
previously  existing debt and all intercompany  debt outstanding to ALLETE.  The
IPO  represented  6.6% of ADESA's 94.9  million  shares then  outstanding.  As a
result of the IPO, ALLETE recorded a $70.1 million increase to Common Stock with
no  gain  recognized  pursuant  to  SEC  Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  Topic  5H,
"Accounting  for  Sales of Stock by a  Subsidiary."  We  accounted  for the 6.6%
public  ownership  of ADESA as a  minority  interest  and  continued  to own and
consolidate  the remaining  portion of ADESA until the spin-off was completed on
September 20, 2004.

In  accordance  with SFAS 144,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  or Disposal of
Long-Lived  Assets,"  we have  reported  our  Automotive  Services  business  in
Discontinued Operations.

WATER SERVICES.  During 2003, we sold, under  condemnation or imminent threat of
condemnation, substantially all of our water assets in Florida for a total sales
price of approximately  $445 million.  Income from  discontinued  operations for
2003 included a $71.6 million  after-tax gain on the sale of  substantially  all
our Water Services businesses. The gain was net of all selling,  transaction and
employee  termination benefit expenses,  as well as impairment losses on certain
remaining assets.

In June 2004, we  essentially  concluded our strategy to exit our Water Services
businesses when we completed the sale of our North Carolina water assets and the
sale of the remaining 72 water and wastewater  systems in Florida.  Aqua America
purchased  our  North   Carolina  water  assets  for  $48  million  and  assumed
approximately  $28  million  in debt,  and also  purchased  63 of our  water and
wastewater  systems in Florida for $14 million.  Seminole  County  purchased the
remaining 9 Florida  systems for a total of $4 million.  The FPSC  approved  the
Seminole County  transaction in September 2004. The transaction  relating to the
sale of 63 water and  wastewater  systems  in Florida  to Aqua  America  remains
subject to regulatory  approval by the FPSC. The approval  process may result in
an adjustment to the final purchase price, based on the FPSC's  determination of
plant investment for the systems.  A decision is expected in late 2005. Gains in
2004 from the sale of our North  Carolina  assets and the  remaining  systems in
Florida were offset by an adjustment to gains reported in 2003,  resulting in an
overall net loss of $0.5 million in 2004.  The  adjustment to gains  reported in
2003 resulted primarily from an arbitration award in December 2004 relating to a
gain-sharing  provision  on a system sold in 2003;  $5.1 million was recorded in
2004  ($1.2  million  in 2003).  We sold our  wastewater  assets in  Georgia  in
February 2005.

The net cash proceeds from the sale of all water assets in 2003 and 2004,  after
transaction  costs,  retirement of most Florida Water debt and payment of income
taxes, were approximately  $300 million.  These net proceeds were used to retire
debt at ALLETE.

In  accordance  with SFAS 144,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  or Disposal of
Long-Lived  Assets," we suspended  depreciating  our Water Services  assets when
they  were   classified  as   held-for-sale   in  2001.  Had  we  not  suspended
depreciation,  depreciation  expense at our Water Services businesses would have
been $2.6 million in 2004 ($12.9 million in 2003; $14.7 million in 2002).

ELECTRIC ODYSSEY. In 2002 we exited our retail stores.

ASSET  RETIREMENT  OBLIGATIONS.  Pursuant  to SFAS  143,  "Accounting  for Asset
Retirement  Obligations," we recognize,  at fair value,  obligations  associated
with  the  retirement  of  tangible,  long-lived  assets  that  result  from the
acquisition,  construction or development  and/or normal operation of the asset.
The  associated  retirement  costs  are  capitalized  as  part  of  the  related
long-lived  asset and  depreciated  over the  useful  life of the  asset.  Asset
retirement  obligations  relate primarily to the  decommissioning of our utility
steam  generating  facilities  and  reclamation at BNI Coal, and are included in
Other  Liabilities on our consolidated  balance sheet.  Removal costs associated
with certain  distribution and  transmission  assets have not been recognized as
these facilities have been determined to have indeterminate  useful lives. Prior
to the adoption of SFAS 143,  utility  decommissioning  obligations were accrued
through  depreciation  expense at depreciation  rates approved by the MPUC. Upon
implementation of SFAS 143, we reclassified  previously recorded  liabilities of
$12.5  million  from  Accumulated  Depreciation  and  capitalized  a  net  asset
retirement cost of $6.7 million.

NOTE 5.    REGULATORY MATTERS

Entities  within our regulated  utility segment file for periodic rate revisions
with the MPUC, the FERC or the PSCW.  Minnesota  Power's last retail rate filing
with the MPUC was in 1994. SWL&P's current retail rates are based on a 2001 PSCW
retail rate order.  During  2004,  SWL&P filed an  application  with the PSCW to
increase retail utility rates by an average of  approximately  6%. New rates, if
approved, are expected to go into effect in the first half of 2005. In 2004, 70%
of our consolidated  operating  revenue was under  regulatory  authority (69% in
2003; 73% in 2002). The MPUC had regulatory  authority over approximately 56% of
our consolidated operating revenue in 2004 (54% in 2003; 58% in 2002).

ELECTRIC RATES. Federal legislation and FERC regulations have been proposed that
aim  to  maintain  reliability,  assure  adequate  energy  supply,  and  address
wholesale price volatility while encouraging wholesale competition.  Legislation
or regulation  that initiates a process which may lead to retail customer choice
of their electric  service  provider  currently lacks momentum in both Minnesota
and Wisconsin.  Legislative and regulatory  activity,  as well as the actions of
competitors,  affect the way Minnesota Power strategically plans for its future.
We  cannot  predict  the  timing  or  substance  of any  future  legislation  or
regulation.

DEFERRED  REGULATORY  CHARGES AND CREDITS.  Our regulated utility operations are
subject to the  provisions  of SFAS 71,  "Accounting  for the Effects of Certain
Types of  Regulation."  We capitalize as deferred  regulatory  charges  incurred
costs  which  are  probable  of  recovery  in  future  utility  rates.  Deferred
regulatory  credits  represent  amounts  expected to be credited to customers in
rates.  Deferred regulatory charges and credits are included in Other Assets and
Other Liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.

NOTE 7.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

SECURITIES  INVESTMENTS.  At December 31, 2004,  Investments included securities
accounted  for as  available-for-sale  under SFAS 115,  "Accounting  for Certain
Investments  in Debt and Equity  Securities,"  and  securities  in our  emerging
technology  portfolio.  Income and  realized  gains and losses  from  securities
investments were included in Other Income  (Expense) on our consolidated  income
statement.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE  SECURITIES.  At December  31, 2004,  our  available-for-sale
securities  portfolio  consisted of securities in a grantor trust established to
fund certain employee  benefits.  Available-for-sale  securities are recorded at
fair value  with  unrealized  gains and losses  included  in  accumulated  other
comprehensive  income,  net of  tax.  Unrealized  losses  that  are  other  than
temporary are recognized in earnings. We use the specific  identification method
as the basis for  determining  the cost of  securities  sold.  Our  policy is to
review  on a  quarterly  basis  available-for-sale  securities  for  other  than
temporary  impairment by assessing  such factors as the  continued  viability of
products offered, cash flow, share price trends and the impact of overall market
conditions.  As a result of our  periodic  assessments,  we did not  record  any
impairment write-down on available-for-sale securities in 2004 or 2003.

During the fourth  quarter of 2004,  we sold 3.3  million  shares of ADESA stock
received  by our ESOP  plan  (see  Note 17) as a result  of the  September  2004
spin-off of ADESA. In total,  the ESOP received total proceeds of $65.9 million,
resulting  in a gain of $11.5  million,  which we  recognized  during the fourth
quarter. We accounted for the ADESA stock as available-for-sale.

During the second quarter of 2003, we sold the publicly-traded  investments held
in our emerging  technology  portfolio and  recognized a $2.3 million  after-tax
loss. These publicly-traded  emerging technology  investments were accounted for
as available-for-sale securities prior to sale.

</TABLE>

EMERGING TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO.  As part of our emerging technology portfolio, we
have  several   minority   investments  in  venture  capital  funds  and  direct
investments in privately-held, start-up companies. We account for our investment
in venture  capital  funds  under the equity  method and  account for our direct
investment in privately-held companies under the cost method. The total carrying
value of our emerging  technology  portfolio  was $13.6  million at December 31,
2004,  down $23.9 million from December 31, 2003.  The decline was primarily due
to a change to the equity  method of  accounting  for the venture  capital funds
(see  Note  14)  and  impairments   related  to  investments  in  privately-held
companies.  Our  basis  in cost  method  investments  included  in the  emerging
technology  portfolio was $4.5 million ($11.0 million in 2003). Our policy is to
review these  investments  quarterly for impairment by assessing such factors as
continued  commercial  viability  of  products,  cash  flow  and  earnings.  Any
impairment  would  reduce the  carrying  value of the  investment.  In 2004,  we
recorded $6.5 million ($4.1 million after tax) of impairment  losses  related to
direct  investments in certain  privately-held,  start-up companies whose future
business prospects have diminished  significantly.  Recent developments at these
companies  indicated  that future  commercial  viability is unlikely,  as is new
financing  necessary to continue  development.  We did not record any impairment
loss on these investments in 2003 ($1.5 million pretax in 2002).

OTHER.  During the second half of 2002, we substantially  liquidated our trading

CONCENTRATION  OF  CREDIT  RISK.  Financial   instruments  that  subject  us  to
concentrations  of  credit  risk  consist  primarily  of  accounts   receivable.
Minnesota Power sells electricity to 12 Large Power Customers.  Receivables from
these  customers  totaled  approximately  $9 million at  December  31,  2004 ($9
million at December 31,  2003).  Minnesota  Power does not obtain  collateral to
support  utility  receivables,   but  monitors  the  credit  standing  of  major
customers.  In addition, our  taconite-producing  Large Power Customers are on a
weekly billing cycle.


NOTE 8.    SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT

SHORT-TERM DEBT. Total short-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2004 was $1.8
million  ($88.6  million at December  31,  2003.) This  consisted of $0 in Notes
Payable ($53  million at December  31, 2003) and $1.8 million of Long-Term  Debt
Due Within One Year ($35.6 million at December 31, 2003).

In July 2003,  ALLETE entered into a one-year credit agreement for $250 million.
The proceeds  were used to redeem $250 million of the  Company's  Floating  Rate
First Mortgage Bonds due October 20, 2003. In April 2004, ALLETE used internally
generated  funds  and  proceeds  from the sale of water  assets  to repay  $53.0
million outstanding under this credit agreement.  The credit agreement contained
certain  mandatory  prepayment  provisions,  including a requirement to repay an
amount  equal to 75% of the net  proceeds  from the  sale of  water  assets.  In
accordance with these provisions, $197.0 million was repaid in 2003.

We have bank  lines of credit  aggregating  $111.5  million  ($176.5  million at
December 31, 2003),  the majority of which will expire in December  2007.  These
bank lines of credit make financing  available through short-term bank loans and
provide  credit  support for  commercial  paper.  At December 31,  2004,  $111.5
million was  available for use ($176.5  million at December 31,  2003).  Certain
lines of credit require a commitment fee of 0.15%. There was no commercial paper
issued as of December 31, 2004 or December 31, 2003.

Our lines of credit contain financial covenants.  The most restrictive covenants
require ALLETE (1) to not exceed a maximum ratio of funded debt to total capital
of .60 to 1.0 and (2) to maintain an  interest  coverage  ratio of not less than
3.00 to 1.00.  Failure  to meet these  covenants  could give rise to an event of
default,  if not corrected  after notice from the lender,  in which event ALLETE
may need to pursue alternative sources of funding.  Certain of ALLETE's lines of
credit contain  cross-default  provisions  under which an event of default would
arise if other ALLETE obligations in excess of $5.0 million were in default.  As
of December 31, 2004, ALLETE was in compliance with these financial covenants.

LONG-TERM  DEBT. The aggregate  amount of long-term debt maturing during 2005 is
$1.8 million ($2.4  million in 2006;  $119.2  million in 2007;  $57.5 million in
2008; $10.3 million in 2009; and $200.8 million  thereafter).  Substantially all
of our electric plant is subject to the lien of the mortgages  securing  various
first mortgage bonds.

At December 31, 2003, BNI Coal had a $28.8 million long-term bank line of credit
outstanding.  The  amount was  repaid in 2004 when BNI Coal  entered  into a new
operating lease agreement. (See Note 11.)

In January 2004, we used internally-generated funds to retire approximately $3.5
million in  principal  amount of  Industrial  Development  Revenue  Bonds Series
1994-A, due January 1, 2004.

In July 2004,  we repaid $125 million in principal  amount of 7.80% Senior Notes
due 2008.  Proceeds from the sale of our water assets and proceeds received from
ADESA were used to repay this debt. As a result of the redemption, we recognized
an expense of $18.5 million in the third  quarter of 2004  comprised of an early
redemption premium and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.

In  August  2004,   we  issued  $111  million  in  principal   amount  of  4.95%
Collateralized  Pollution  Control Refunding Revenue Bonds Series 2004 due 2022.
Proceeds   were  used  to  redeem  $111  million  in  principal   amount  of  6%
Collateralized Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds Series E due 2022.

ALLETE's  letters  of credit  supporting  certain  long-term  debt  arrangements
contain financial  covenants.  The most restrictive covenant requires ALLETE not
to exceed a maximum ratio of funded debt to total capital of .65 to 1.0. Failure
to meet these  covenants may give rise to an event of default,  if not corrected
after  notice from the trustee or security  holder.  Some of ALLETE's  long-term
debt  arrangements  contain  "cross-default"  provisions that would result in an
event of default if there is a failure  under other  financing  arrangements  to
meet  payment  terms or to  observe  other  covenants  that  would  result in an
acceleration of payments due. As of December 31, 2004,  ALLETE was in compliance
with these financial covenants.

SHAREHOLDER  RIGHTS PLAN.  In 1996, we adopted a rights plan that provides for a
dividend  distribution  of one  preferred  share  purchase  right  (Right) to be
attached to each share of common stock.

The Rights,  which are currently not exercisable or transferable  apart from our
common stock,  entitle the holder to purchase  one-and-a-half  of  one-hundredth
(three  two-hundredths)  of a share of ALLETE's Junior Serial Preferred Stock A,
without par value. The purchase price as defined in the Rights Plan,  remains at
$90.  These  Rights  would  become  exercisable  if a person  or group  acquires
beneficial  ownership  of 15% or more of our common  stock or announces a tender
offer which would increase the person's or group's beneficial ownership interest
to 15% or more of our common stock,  subject to certain  exceptions.  If the 15%
threshold  is met,  each Right  entitles  the holder  (other than the  acquiring
person or group) to purchase common stock (or, in certain  circumstances,  cash,
property or other  securities  of ours) having a market price equal to twice the
exercise  price  of the  Right.  If we are  acquired  in a  merger  or  business
combination,  or 50% or more of our  assets or  earning  power  are  sold,  each
exercisable  Right entitles the holder to purchase common stock of the acquiring
or surviving  company  having a value equal to twice the  exercise  price of the
Right.  Certain stock acquisitions will also trigger a provision  permitting the
Board of Directors to exchange each Right for one share of our common stock.

The Rights,  which expire on July 23, 2006, are nonvoting and may be redeemed by
us at a price of  $0.005  per Right at any time  they are not  exercisable.  One
million shares of Junior Serial  Preferred  Stock A have been authorized and are
reserved for issuance under the plan.

NOTE 10.   JOINTLY-OWNED ELECTRIC FACILITY

We own 80% of the 537-MW Boswell Energy Center Unit 4 (Boswell Unit 4). While we
operate the plant,  certain decisions about the operations of Boswell Unit 4 are
subject to the oversight of a committee on which we and Wisconsin  Public Power,
Inc.  (WPPI),  the  owner  of the  other  20% of  Boswell  Unit  4,  have  equal
representation and voting rights.  Each of us must provide our own financing and
is obligated to pay our ownership share of operating  costs. Our share of direct
operating  expenses of Boswell  Unit 4 is included in  operating  expense on our
consolidated statement of income. Our 80% share of the original cost included in
property,  plant and  equipment  at  December  31, 2004 was $309  million  ($308
million at  December  31,  2003).  The  corresponding  accumulated  depreciation

2003).


NOTE 11.   COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES

SQUARE BUTTE POWER  PURCHASE  AGREEMENT.  Minnesota  Power has a power  purchase
agreement with Square Butte that extends through 2026 (Agreement). It provides a
long-term  supply  of  low-cost  energy to  customers  in our  electric  service
territory and enables  Minnesota Power to meet power pool reserve  requirements.
Square Butte, a North Dakota cooperative  corporation,  owns a 455-MW coal-fired
generating  unit (Unit) near  Center,  North  Dakota.  The Unit is adjacent to a
generating unit owned by Minnkota Power, a North Dakota cooperative  corporation
whose Class A members are also members of Square Butte. Minnkota Power serves as
the operator of the Unit and also purchases power from Square Butte.

Minnesota Power is entitled to approximately  71% of the Unit's output under the
Agreement.  After  2005,  and upon  compliance  with a two-year  advance  notice
requirement,   Minnkota  Power  has  the  option  to  reduce  Minnesota  Power's
entitlement by approximately 5% annually,  to a minimum of 50%. In December 2004
and 2003,  we received  notices  from  Minnkota  Power that they will reduce our
output  entitlement  by  approximately  5% in 2006  and  2007,  to 66% and  60%,
respectively.

Minnesota  Power is obligated to pay its pro rata share of Square  Butte's costs
based on Minnesota Power's entitlement to Unit output. Minnesota Power's payment
obligation will be suspended if Square Butte fails to deliver any power, whether
produced or  purchased,  for a period of one year.  Square  Butte's  fixed costs
consist primarily of debt service.  At December 31, 2004, Square Butte had total
debt  outstanding of $314.9 million.  Total annual debt service for Square Butte
is expected to be  approximately  $25 million in each of the years 2005  through
2009.  Variable  operating  costs include the price of coal  purchased  from BNI
Coal, our subsidiary, under a long-term contract.

Minnesota  Power's  cost of power  purchased  from Square  Butte during 2004 was
$56.1 million ($52.3  million in 2003 and $60.9 million in 2002).  This reflects
Minnesota  Power's pro rata share of total Square Butte costs,  based on the 71%
output entitlement in 2004, 2003 and 2002. Included in this amount was Minnesota
Power's  pro rata  share of  interest  expense of $12.6  million in 2004  ($12.8
million in 2003;  $13.7 million in 2002).  Minnesota  Power's payments to Square
Butte are approved as a purchased power expense for ratemaking  purposes by both
the MPUC and the FERC.

LEASING AGREEMENTS.  In September 2004, BNI Coal entered into an operating lease
agreement  for a new  dragline  that was placed in service at BNI Coal's mine on
September 30, 2004. BNI Coal is obligated to make lease  payments  totaling $2.8
million  annually  for the lease  term which  expires in 2027.  BNI Coal has the
option at the end of the lease term to renew the lease at a fair market  rental,
to purchase the dragline at fair market value,  or to surrender the dragline and
pay a $3.0 million termination fee.

We lease other  properties and equipment under  operating lease  agreements with
terms expiring  through 2013. The aggregate amount of minimum lease payments for
all of these other  operating  leases is $6.3  million in 2005,  $6.0 million in
2006, $5.6 million in 2007,  $4.9 million in 2008 and $53.4 million  thereafter.
Total rent expense was $2.8 million in 2004 ($3.8 million in 2003;  $3.2 million
in 2002).

KENDALL  COUNTY  POWER  PURCHASE  AGREEMENT.  We  have  275  MW of  nonregulated
generation (non rate-base generation sold at market-based rates to the wholesale
market)  through an  agreement  with  LSP-Kendall  Energy that  extends  through
mid-September 2017. Under the agreement,  we pay a fixed capacity charge for the
right, but not the obligation,  to capacity and energy from a 275-MW  generating
unit at a facility in Kendall County near Chicago,  Illinois.  We currently have
130 MW of long-term  capacity sales contracts for the Kendall County generation,
with 50 MW expiring in April 2012 and 80 MW expiring in September 2017. To date,
this power purchase agreement has resulted in losses to us due to negative spark
spreads  (the  differential  between  electric  and  natural  gas prices) in the
wholesale  power market and our resulting  inability to cover the fixed capacity
charge on unsold capacity (currently 145 MW). An after-tax loss of approximately
$8 million was recognized in 2004.

In December  2004,  we entered into an  agreement to assign this power  purchase
agreement to Constellation Energy Commodities. Under the terms of the agreement,
we will pay Constellation  Energy  Commodities $73 million in cash to assume the
power purchase agreement.  The proposed  transaction is subject to the approvals
of LSP-Kendall  Energy, as well as of its project lenders and the FERC.  Pending
these approvals, the transaction is scheduled to close in April 2005. The 130 MW
of long-term  capacity sales contracts will also be transferred to Constellation
Energy  Commodities  at  closing.   We  will  recognize  an  after-tax  loss  of
approximately $47 million upon the closing of this transaction.

COAL AND SHIPPING  CONTRACTS.  We have three coal supply agreements with various
expiration  dates ranging from December 2006 to December 2009. We also have rail
and shipping  agreements  for  transportation  of all of our coal,  with various
expiration dates ranging from December 2005 to December 2011. Our minimum annual
obligation under these coal and shipping  agreements  ranges from  approximately
$32 million in 2005 to $6 million in 2009.

EMERGING  TECHNOLOGY  PORTFOLIO.  We have  investments in emerging  technologies
through  minority  investments  in venture  capital funds  structured as limited
liability  companies,   and  direct  investments  in  privately-held,   start-up
companies.  We have committed to make additional investments in certain emerging
technology  holdings.  The total future  commitment was $4.5 million at December
31, 2004 ($4.8  million at December  31, 2003) and is expected to be invested at
various  times  through  2007.  We do not  have  plans  to make  any  additional
investments beyond this commitment.

ENVIRONMENTAL  MATTERS.  Our  businesses  are subject to  regulation  by various
federal,  state and  local  authorities  concerning  environmental  matters.  We
anticipate  that  potential  expenditures  for  environmental  matters  will  be
material  in the  future,  due to stricter  environmental  requirements  through
legislation and/or rulemakings that are expected to require  significant capital
investments.   We  are  unable  to  predict  if  and  when  any  such   stricter
environmental  requirements will be imposed and the impact they will have on the
Company.  We review  environmental  matters on a quarterly  basis.  Accruals for
environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably  estimated,  based on
current law and existing technologies.  These accruals are adjusted periodically
as assessment and  remediation  efforts  progress or as additional  technical or
legal information becomes available.  Accruals for environmental liabilities are
included in the balance  sheet at  undiscounted  amounts and exclude  claims for
recoveries from insurance or other third parties. Costs related to environmental
contamination treatment and cleanup are charged to expense unless recoverable in
rates from customers.

SWL&P  MANUFACTURED  GAS PLANT. In May 2001, SWL&P received notice from the WDNR
that the City of Superior had found soil  contamination on property  adjoining a
former  Manufactured  Gas  Plant  (MGP)  site  owned  and  operated  by  SWL&P's
predecessors  from  1889 to  1904.  The WDNR  requested  SWL&P  to  initiate  an
environmental  investigation.  The WDNR also issued  SWL&P a  Responsible  Party
letter in  February  2002.  The  environmental  investigation  is under way.  In
February  2003,  SWL&P  submitted a Phase II  environmental  site  investigation
report to the WDNR.  This report  identified  some MGP-like  chemicals that were
found in the soil near the  former  plant  site.  During  March and April  2003,
sediment  samples were taken from nearby Superior Bay. The report on the results
of this  sampling was completed and sent to the WDNR during the first quarter of
2004. The next phase of the  investigation is to determine any impact to soil or
ground  water  between the former MGP site and  Superior  Bay. The site work for
this phase of the investigation was performed during October 2004, and the final
report is expected to be sent to the WDNR during the first  quarter of 2005.  It
is anticipated  that additional site  investigation  will be needed during 2005.
Although it is not possible to quantify the  potential  clean-up  cost until the
investigation  is completed,  a $0.5 million  liability was recorded in December
2003  to  address  the  known  areas  of  contamination.   We  have  recorded  a
corresponding dollar amount as a regulatory asset to offset this liability.  The
PSCW has approved SWL&P's deferral of these MGP environmental  investigation and
potential  clean-up costs for future recovery in rates,  subject to a regulatory
prudency review.  ALLETE maintains  pollution  liability insurance coverage that
includes coverage for SWL&P. A claim has been filed with respect to this matter.
The insurance  carrier has issued a reservation of rights letter and we continue
to work with the insurer to determine the availability of insurance coverage.

SQUARE BUTTE GENERATING FACILITY.  In June 2002, Minnkota Power, the operator of
Square Butte,  received a Notice of Violation from the EPA regarding alleged New
Source Review  violations at the M.R. Young  Station,  which includes the Square
Butte  generating  unit. The EPA claims certain  capital  projects  completed by
Minnkota  Power  should have been  reviewed  pursuant  to the New Source  Review
regulations,  potentially  resulting  in new air  permit  operating  conditions.
Minnkota  Power has held  several  meetings  with the EPA to discuss the alleged
violations.  Discussions  with the EPA are  ongoing and we are unable to predict
the outcome or cost  impacts.  If Square  Butte is required to make  significant
capital  expenditures  to comply with EPA  requirements,  we expect such capital
expenditures  to be debt  financed.  Our future  cost of  purchased  power would
include our pro rata share of this additional debt service.

OTHER.  We are involved in litigation  arising in the normal course of business.
Also in the normal course of business,  we are involved in tax,  regulatory  and
other  governmental  audits,  inspections,  investigations and other proceedings
that involve state and federal taxes, safety, compliance with regulations,  rate
base and cost of service  issues,  among other things.  While the  resolution of
such matters could have a material effect on earnings and cash flows in the year
of  resolution,  none of these  matters are  expected to change  materially  our
present liquidity position,  nor have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition.

NOTE 14.   CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

In the third quarter of 2004, we adopted EITF 03-16, "Accounting for Investments
in Limited Liability  Companies," which requires the use of the equity method of
accounting  for  investments  in  all  limited  liability  companies,  including
investments  we have in venture  capital  funds within our  emerging  technology
portfolio.  EITF  03-16  was  issued  in the  second  quarter  of  2004.  We had
previously  accounted for these investments under the cost method of accounting.
EITF 03-16 is effective for  reporting  periods  beginning  after June 15, 2004.
Pursuant  to EITF 03-16,  the effect of  adoption is reported as the  cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of this change
on prior years was a loss of $13.3 million ($7.8 million  after-tax),  which was
recorded as a change in  accounting  principle  and  reflected in income for the
year ended December 31, 2004.  During 2004, $1.6 million of current losses under
the equity method were recognized.

NOTE 16.   PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

We  have  noncontributory   defined  benefit  pension  plans  covering  eligible
employees.  The plans  provide  defined  benefits  based on years of service and
final  average pay. We also have defined  contribution  pension  plans  covering
substantially  all  employees;  employer  contributions  are  made  through  our
employee  stock  ownership plan (see Note 17),  except for BNI Coal,  which made
cash contributions of $0.6 million in 2004 ($0.6 million in 2003).

We have  postretirement  health care and life insurance plans covering  eligible
employees.  The  postretirement  health plans are contributory  with participant
contributions  adjusted  annually.  Postretirement  health and life benefits are
funded through a combination of Voluntary  Employee Benefit  Association  trusts
(VEBAs),  established  under section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code, and
an irrevocable grantor trust.  Contributions  deductible for income tax purposes
are made  directly  to the VEBAs;  nondeductible  contributions  are made to the
irrevocable grantor trust.  Amounts are transferred from the irrevocable grantor
trust to the VEBAs when they become deductible for income tax purposes.

We use a September 30 measurement date for the pension and postretirement health
and life plans.

Under SFAS 106,  "Employers'  Accounting for Postretirement  Benefits Other Than
Pensions,"  only  assets in the VEBAs are  treated  as plan  assets in the table
above  for  the  purpose  of  determining  funded  status.  In  addition  to the
postretirement health and life assets reported above, we had $24.4 million in an
irrevocable  grantor  trust at December 31, 2004 ($20.2  million at December 31,
2003).  We  consolidate  the  irrevocable  grantor  trust and it is  included in
Investments on our consolidated balance sheet.

We expect to contribute  approximately $6 million to our  postretirement  health
and life plans in 2005.  We are not  required to make any  contributions  to our
defined benefit pension plans in 2005.

In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP 106-2,  "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003 (Act)," which provides  accounting  and  disclosure  guidance for employers
that sponsor  postretirement  health care plans that provide  prescription  drug
benefits.  FSP  106-2  requires  that  the  accumulated  postretirement  benefit
obligation  and  postretirement  benefit cost reflect the impact of the Act upon
adoption.  We provide  postretirement  health benefits that include prescription
drug  benefits and have  concluded  that our  prescription  drug  benefits  will
qualify us for the federal  subsidy to be provided for under the Act. We adopted
FSP 106-2 in the third  quarter of 2004.  The  impact of  adoption  reduced  our
after-tax postretirement medical expense by $1.6 million for 2004.

NOTE 17.   EMPLOYEE STOCK AND INCENTIVE PLANS

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP  PLAN. We sponsor a leveraged  employee stock ownership
plan (ESOP) within the Retirement  Savings and Stock  Ownership Plan (RSOP) that
covers certain  eligible  employees.  In 1989, the ESOP used the proceeds from a
$16.5 million third-party loan, guaranteed by us, to purchase 0.4 million shares
of our common stock on the open market.  This loan was fully repaid in 2004, and
all shares  originally  purchased  with loan  proceeds  have been  allocated  to
participants. In 1990, the ESOP issued a $75 million note (term not to exceed 25
years at  10.25%) to us as  consideration  for 1.9  million  shares of our newly
issued common stock. The Company makes annual contributions to the ESOP equal to
the ESOP's debt  service  less  available  dividends  received by the ESOP.  The
majority of dividends  received by the ESOP are used to pay debt  service,  with
the balance distributed to participants.  The ESOP shares were initially pledged
as  collateral  for its debt.  As the debt is repaid,  shares are released  from
collateral  and  allocated  to  participants,  based on the  proportion  of debt
service paid in the year.  As shares are released from  collateral,  the Company
reports  compensation  expense equal to the current  market price of the shares.
Dividends  on  allocated  ESOP shares are  recorded  as a reduction  of retained
earnings;  available  dividends  on  unallocated  ESOP shares are  recorded as a
reduction  of debt and  accrued  interest.  ESOP  compensation  expense was $5.0
million in 2004 ($3.7 million in 2003; $3.9 million in 2002).

As a result of the  September  2004  spin-off of ADESA,  the ESOP  received  3.3
million shares of ADESA stock related to unearned ESOP shares that have not been
allocated to participants. The ESOP was required to sell the ADESA stock and use
the proceeds to purchase  ALLETE common stock on the open market.  In accordance
with a private  letter  ruling  received  from the Internal  Revenue  Service in
December  2004,  the ESOP has until May 2006 to complete the sale of ADESA stock
and the purchase of ALLETE common stock. At December 31, 2004, the ESOP had sold
all of these ADESA shares. The 3.3 million ADESA shares sold by the ESOP in 2004
resulted in total  proceeds  of $65.9  million  and an  after-tax  gain of $11.5
million,  which we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2004. The ESOP used $35.6
million of the  proceeds to purchase 1.0 million  shares of ALLETE  common stock
during  the  fourth  quarter  of 2004.  Under the  direction  of an  independent
trustee,  the ESOP had $30.3  million of cash  available at December 31, 2004 to
purchase  ALLETE  common  stock;  we  reported  the  cash  held  by the  ESOP as
Restricted  Cash on our  consolidated  balance  sheet.  During January 2005, the
trustee  purchased an additional  0.5 million  shares of ALLETE common stock and
$8.9 million remains as Restricted Cash.

As of January  31,  2005,  participants  in the RSOP had $52.2  million,  or 2.5
million  shares,  invested in ADESA common stock.  Beginning  later in 2005, the
RSOP trustee will be selling the ADESA common stock and purchasing ALLETE common
stock according to the  requirements of the RSOP.  Participants may transfer out
of the ADESA common stock fund at any time.  That decision also initiates a sale
of ADESA  common  stock but may not  initiate  an ALLETE  purchase,  unless  the
participant chooses to transfer to the ALLETE common stock fund.

Pursuant  to AICPA  Statement  of  Position  93-6,  "Employers'  Accounting  for
Employee Stock Ownership Plans,"  unallocated ALLETE common stock currently held
and  purchased  by the ESOP will be  treated  as  unearned  ESOP  shares and not
considered as outstanding for earnings per share  computations.  ESOP shares are
included  in  earnings  per  share  computations  after  they are  allocated  to
participants.

STOCK  OPTION  AND  AWARD  PLANS.  We  have  an  Executive  Long-Term  Incentive
Compensation Plan (Executive Plan) and a Director Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan
(Director  Plan).  The Executive  Plan allows for the grant of up to 3.2 million
shares of our common stock to key  employees.  To date,  these grants have taken
the form of stock options, performance share awards and restricted stock awards.
The Director Plan allows for the grant of up to 0.1 million shares of our common
stock to nonemployee directors.  Each nonemployee director may receive an annual
grant of 500 stock options and a biennial grant of  performance  shares equal to
$10,000 in value of common stock at the date of grant.  No grants have been made
since 2003 under the Director Plan.  Stock options are exercisable at the market
price of common  shares on the date the  options  are  granted and vest in equal
annual  installments  over two years, with expiration ten years from the date of
grant.  Performance  shares are earned  over  multi-year  time  periods  and are
contingent  upon  the  attainment  of  certain   performance  goals  of  ALLETE.
Restricted  stock vests once certain  periods of time have elapsed.  At December
31, 2004, 1.3 million shares were held in reserve for future  issuance under the
Executive Plan and Director Plan.

The  employee  stock  options  outstanding  at the  date  of the  spin-off  were
converted to reflect the spin-off and  one-for-three  reverse stock split.  This
conversion was done to preserve the noncompensatory  nature of the options under
FASB Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation."

At December 31,  2004,  options  outstanding  consisted of less than 0.1 million
with an exercise  price of $15.88 to $18.85,  0.3 million with an exercise price
of $23.79 to $29.79  and 0.1  million  with an  exercise  price of  $37.76.  The
options  with an exercise  price of $23.79 to $29.79  have an average  remaining
contractual  life of 6.6 years,  with 0.3 million  exercisable  on December  31,
2004,  at an average  price of $27.46.  The options  with an  exercise  price of
$37.76 have an average  remaining  contractual life of 9 years, with 0.1 million
exercisable on December 31, 2004.

A total of 0.1 million  performance  share grants were awarded in February  2004
for  performance  periods  ending in 2005 and 2006.  The  ultimate  issuance  is
contingent  upon the  attainment of certain future  performance  goals of ALLETE
during the  performance  periods.  The grant date fair value of the  performance
share awards was $1.6 million.

A total of 0.1 million  performance  share  grants were awarded in 2002 and 2003
for the performance period ended December 31, 2003. The grant date fair value of
the share awards was $8.3 million.  In early 2004, 50% of the shares were issued
with the balance to be issued in 2005.

In February  2005,  we granted  stock  options to purchase less than 0.1 million
shares of common stock (exercise price of $41.35 per share).

EMPLOYEE  STOCK  PURCHASE  PLAN.  We have an Employee  Stock  Purchase Plan that
permits eligible  employees to buy up to $23,750 per year of our common stock at
95% of the market  price.  At December  31,  2004,  1.3 million  shares had been
issued  under the plan and 0.1  million  shares  were held in reserve for future
issuance.

NOTE 18.   QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)

Information for any one quarterly  period is not  necessarily  indicative of the
results  which may be  expected  for the year.  Financial  results for the first
quarter of 2004 included a $7.8 million, or $0.27 per share,  non-cash after-tax
charge  for a change in  accounting  principle  related  to  investments  in our
emerging technology  portfolio.  Financial results for the third quarter of 2004
included a $10.9 million, or $0.38 per share,  after-tax debt prepayment cost as
part of ALLETE's  financial  restructuring  in  preparation  for the spin-off of
ADESA,  which occurred on September 20, 2004.  Financial  results for the fourth
quarter of 2004 included an $11.5 million, or $0.41 per share, after-tax gain on
the sale of ADESA shares held by our ESOP. The ESOP received the ADESA shares as
a result of the spin-off.

Financial  results  for 2003  included  a $71.6  million,  or $2.59  per  share,
after-tax gain on the sale of  substantially  all our Water Services  businesses
($0.2  million  first quarter and second  quarter;  $3.0  million,  or $0.11 per
share, third quarter;  $68.2 million, or $2.47 per share,  fourth quarter).  The
gain  was net of all  selling,  transaction  and  employee  termination  benefit
expenses, as well as impairment losses on certain remaining assets.
