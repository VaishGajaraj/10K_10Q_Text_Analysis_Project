                         SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE
                          PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION
                               REFORM ACT OF 1995

   In  connection  with the safe harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995,  we are  hereby  filing  cautionary  statements
identifying  important  factors  that could  cause our actual  results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as such term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE  in this  Annual  Report on Form  10-K,  in  presentations,  in
response to questions or otherwise.  Any  statements  that  express,  or involve
discussions as to,  expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions or
future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or
phrases such as "anticipates,"  "believes,"  "estimates,"  "expects," "intends,"
"plans,"   "projects,"   "will  likely   result,"  "will  continue"  or  similar
expressions) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward-looking.
   Forward-looking   statements  involve  estimates,   assumptions,   risks  and
uncertainties  and are  qualified  in their  entirety by  reference  to, and are
accompanied by, the following important factors, which are difficult to predict,
contain  uncertainties,  are beyond our control and may cause actual  results or
outcomes  to  differ   materially  from  those   contained  in   forward-looking
statements:

   - war and acts of terrorism;
   - prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions, including those of
     the United States  Congress,  state  legislatures,  the FERC, the MPUC, the
     FPSC, the NCUC, the PSCW and various county regulators, about allowed rates
     of  return,  financings,  industry  and  rate  structure,  acquisition  and
     disposal of assets and  facilities,  operation  and  construction  of plant
     facilities,  recovery  of  purchased  power and  capital  investments,  and
     present or prospective wholesale and retail competition  (including but not
     limited to  transmission  costs) as well as general  vehicle-related  laws,
     including vehicle brokerage and auction laws;
   - unanticipated   impacts  of  restructuring  initiatives  in   the  electric
     industry;
   - economic and geographic factors, including political and economic risks;
   - changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies;
   - weather conditions;
   - natural disasters;
   - market factors affecting supply and demand for used vehicles;
   - wholesale power market conditions;
   - population growth rates and demographic patterns;
   - the effects of competition, including competition for retail and  wholesale
     customers, as well as suppliers and purchasers of vehicles;
   - pricing and transportation of commodities;
   - changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
   - unanticipated project delays or changes in project costs;
   - unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;
   - capital market conditions;
   - competition for economic expansion or development opportunities;
   - our ability to manage expansion and integrate recent acquisitions; and
   - the outcome  of  legal  and  administrative  proceedings (whether civil  or
     criminal) and settlements that  affect the business and   profitability  of
     ALLETE.

   Any  forward-looking  statement  speaks  only as of the  date on  which  such
statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any  forward-looking
statement  to  reflect  events or  circumstances  after  the date on which  that
statement is made or to reflect the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events.  New
factors  emerge  from  time to time and it is not  possible  for  management  to
predict  all of these  factors,  nor can it assess  the  impact of each of these
factors  on the  businesses  of ALLETE or the  extent  to which any  factor,  or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.

                                     PART 1

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

   ALLETE is a  diversified  company  incorporated  under the laws of  Minnesota
since  1906.  References  in this report to "we" and "our" are to ALLETE and its
subsidiaries, collectively.
   ALLETE files annual,  quarterly and other reports and other  information with
the SEC. You can read and copy any  information  filed by ALLETE with the SEC at
the SEC's Public  Reference  Room at 450 Fifth Street,  N.W.,  Washington,  D.C.
20549. You can obtain additional  information about the Public Reference Room by
calling the SEC at  1-800-SEC-0330.  In addition,  the SEC maintains an Internet
site (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements,  and
other  information  regarding  issuers  that file  electronically  with the SEC,
including ALLETE.  ALLETE also maintains an Internet site  (www.allete.com) that
contains  documents as soon as  reasonably  practicable  after such  material is
electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
   As of December 31, 2002 we had approximately 14,000 employees, 4,600 of which
were part time. Our core  operations in 42 states,  nine Canadian  provinces and
Mexico focus on two segments:  ENERGY  SERVICES which includes  electric and gas
services,  coal mining and  telecommunications;  and  AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES which
includes  a network of  wholesale  and total loss  vehicle  auctions,  a finance
company,  a  vehicle  remarketing  company,  a  company  that  provides  vehicle
inspection  services to the automotive  industry and its lenders,  and a company
that provides  Internet-based  parts location and insurance claim audit services
nationwide.
   INVESTMENTS  AND  CORPORATE  CHARGES  include  our  real  estate  operations,
investments in emerging  technologies  related to the electric  utility industry
and corporate charges.  Corporate charges represent general corporate  expenses,
including interest, not specifically related to any one business segment.
   In  2002  Energy  Services  completed  the  restarting  of  the  nonregulated
generating  facilities at Taconite Harbor.  We integrated our MPEX division into
Split Rock Energy and combined Minnesota Power Telecom, Inc. and Enventis,  Inc.
operations  into Enventis  Telecom.  During 2002 we also  cancelled a generation
project in Grand Rapids,  Minnesota, and indefinitely delayed one that was under
way in Superior,  Wisconsin.  The  construction  of the  transmission  line from
Duluth,   Minnesota,  to  Wausau,  Wisconsin,  has  been  delayed.  (See  Energy
Services.)
   In 2002  Automotive  Services  opened ADESA Golden Gate, the largest  vehicle
auction in California,  and ADESA Vancouver in Richmond,  British Columbia. Both
were built to replace aging facilities that were too small to efficiently  serve
our growing customer demand.  Wholesale auction  facilities in Long Island,  New
York; Atlanta,  Georgia; and Edmonton,  Alberta, are also under construction and
slated to open in 2003. A small  auction has been  initiated in Mexico at a Ford
Motor Company facility. Finally, we increased our total loss vehicle auctions by
two, buying one and building another.
   In 2002 Investments  purchased additional real estate for sale in Florida and
liquidated the trading securities portfolio.

   In 2002 we executed plans developed in a 2001 strategic  review of all of the
Company's  businesses  to  identify  ways of  unlocking  shareholder  value  not
reflected in the price of our common stock. Businesses identified as having more
value if operated by potential  purchasers than by us include our Water Services
businesses in Florida,  North Carolina and Georgia,  our auto transport business
and the retail store. We sold our auto transport  business and exited our retail
store at the end of first quarter 2002.
   In 2002 Florida  Water  signed an asset  purchase  agreement  for the sale of
substantially all of its assets to the Florida Water Services  Authority (FWSA),
a  governmental  authority  formed  under the laws of the state of Florida,  for
$492.5 million.  Florida Water anticipates receiving  approximately $420 million
at closing and an  additional  $36.5  million  three years  after  closing  once
certain contingencies have been satisfied. In addition, Florida Water expects to
receive up to $36  million of future  customer  hookup  fees to be paid over the
next six years. Cash proceeds to ALLETE after taxes and

repayment  of existing  debt are  expected to be  approximately  $180 million in
2003, and $250 million for the entire  transaction.  The gain on the transaction
is estimated at $100 million after taxes and related  costs.  While the majority
of the cash will be received at closing,  the gain is expected to be  recognized
in future years as required by accounting rules.
   Eleven lawsuits  seeking to halt the sale of Florida Water assets to the FWSA
have been  filed,  primarily  by local  governments  which had hoped to purchase
Florida  Water's assets through a competing  buyer.  Pursuant to notice given on
January  28,  2003,  the FPSC held an agenda  conference  on February 4, 2003 in
which it ordered  Florida Water to file, in advance of closing the  transaction,
an  application  requesting  approval of the transfer of its assets to the FWSA,
and further ordered Florida Water to refrain from closing the transaction before
FPSC  approval.  Florida Water is asking a court to determine  that the FPSC may
not delay closing of the sale and is required by law to approve this transfer as
a matter of  right. Florida Water considers the lawsuits to be without merit and
is vigorously contesting these lawsuits. Litigation challenging this transaction
continues to delay its closing.
   We anticipate  selling our Water  Services  businesses in North  Carolina and
Georgia by the end of 2003.

ENERGY SERVICES

   We categorize our Energy  Services  businesses as utility,  nonregulated,  or
nonutility. Utility operations include rate regulated activities associated with
generation,  transmission and distribution of electricity under the jurisdiction
of state and federal regulatory authorities.  Nonregulated generation operations
consist  primarily  of Taconite  Harbor in  northern  Minnesota  and  generation
obtained  from a  facility  near  Chicago,  Illinois,  through a  15-year  power
purchase  agreement  with NRG Energy.  Nonregulated  generation is non-rate base
generation sold at wholesale at market-based  rates,  pursuant to authority from
the  FERC.  Coal  mining  and  telecommunications  are also  included  in Energy
Services and are categorized as nonutility.  The discussion below summarizes the
major  businesses  we include in Energy  Services.  Statistical  information  is
presented as of December 31, 2002 unless otherwise  indicated.  All subsidiaries
are wholly owned unless otherwise specifically indicated.
   MINNESOTA POWER, an operating division of ALLETE,  provides  electricity in a
26,000 square mile electric service territory located in northeastern Minnesota.
Minnesota Power supplies  utility  electric  service to 133,000 retail customers
and wholesale electric service to 16 municipalities. SWL&P sells electricity and
natural gas, and provides  water service in  northwestern  Wisconsin.  SWL&P has
14,000  electric  customers,  12,000  natural  gas  customers  and 10,000  water
customers.
   Minnesota  Power had an annual  net peak load of 1,402 MW on January 7, 2002.
Our power supply  sources are listed on the  following  page.
   We have electric transmission and distribution lines of 500 kV (8 miles), 230
kV (606 miles),  161 kV (43 miles),  138 kV (66 miles), 115 kV (1,259 miles) and
less than 115 kV (6,557 miles).  We own and operate 180 substations with a total
capacity of 8,550  megavoltamperes.  Some of our  transmission  and distribution
lines interconnect with other utilities.
   We own offices and service  buildings,  an energy  control  center and repair
shops; and lease offices and storerooms in various localities. Substantially all
of  our  electric  plant  is  subject  to  mortgages  which   collateralize  the
outstanding first mortgage bonds of Minnesota Power and of SWL&P. Generally, the
Company  holds fee interest in its real  properties  subject only to the lien of
the mortgages.  Most of our electric lines are located on land not owned in fee,
but are covered by  appropriate  easement  rights or by  necessary  permits from
governmental authorities. WPPI owns 20% of Boswell Unit 4. WPPI has the right to
use  our  transmission  line  facilities  to  transport  its  share  of  Boswell
generation. (See Note 7.)
   In early 2002 Minnesota Power  integrated its power  marketing  division into
Split Rock Energy. (See discussion of Split Rock Energy below.)
   BNI COAL owns and  operates  a lignite  mine in North  Dakota.  Two  electric
generating  cooperatives,  Minnkota  Power and Square Butte,  presently  consume
virtually all of BNI Coal's  production of lignite under  cost-plus  coal supply
agreements expiring in 2027. (See Fuel and Note 13.)
   ENVENTIS  TELECOM.  In  early  2002  our   telecommunications   subsidiaries,
Minnesota  Power  Telecom,  Inc. and Enventis,  Inc.  which was acquired in July
2001,  were  merged to  operate  as  Enventis  Telecom.  Enventis  Telecom is an
integrated data services provider  offering fiber optic-based  communication and
advanced data services to businesses and communities in Minnesota, Wisconsin and
Missouri. Enventis Telecom provides converged IP (or Internet protocol) services
that  allow  all  communications  (voice,  video  and  data)  to  use  the  same
optic-based  delivery  technology.  Enventis  Telecom  owns  or  has  rights  to
approximately  1,500 route miles of fiber optic cable. These route miles contain
multiple fibers that total  approximately  48,000 fiber miles.  Enventis Telecom
also owns optronic and data  switching  equipment that is used to "light up" the
fiber optic cable.  Enventis Telecom services customers from facilities that are
primarily leased from third parties.
   RAINY  RIVER  ENERGY  is  engaged  in  the  acquisition  and  development  of
nonregulated generation and wholesale power marketing.

   Minnesota  Power has wholesale  contracts with 16 municipal  customers.  (See
Regulatory Issues - Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.)
   Approximately  60% of the ore consumed by integrated  steel facilities in the
United  States  originates  from six  taconite  customers  of  Minnesota  Power.
Taconite, an iron-bearing rock of relatively low iron content that is abundantly
available in Minnesota,  is an important domestic source of raw material for the
steel  industry.  Taconite  processing  plants use large  quantities of electric
power to grind the  ore-bearing  rock,  and  agglomerate  and pelletize the iron
particles into taconite pellets.  Annual taconite production in Minnesota was 39
million  tons in 2002 (33 million tons in 2001;  47 million  tons in 2000).  The
decrease  in 2001  taconite  production  was due to the  closing  of LTV and the
reduced  demand for iron ore from the operating  mines as a result of high steel
import levels and a softer  economy.  LTV,  which was not a Large Power Customer
(defined  below),  formerly  produced  7 million to 8 million  tons of  taconite
annually.  Based on our research of the taconite  industry,  Minnesota  taconite
production  for 2003 is  anticipated to be about 37 million tons. As a result of
continuing  consolidation  in the  integrated  steel  business and its resulting
impact on  taconite  producers,  Minnesota  Power is unable to predict  taconite
production  levels for the next two to five years.  We expect any excess  energy
not used by our retail customers will be marketed  primarily  through Split Rock
Energy to the wholesale market.
   LARGE POWER  CUSTOMER  CONTRACTS.  Minnesota  Power has large power  customer
contracts with 13 customers (Large Power  Customers),  each of which requires 10
MW or more of  generating  capacity.  Large  Power  Customer  contracts  require
Minnesota Power to have a certain amount of generating capacity available.  (See
table  below.) In turn,  each Large Power  Customer is required to pay a minimum
monthly  demand charge that covers the fixed costs  associated  with having this
capacity  available to serve the customer,  including a return on common equity.
Most contracts allow customers to establish the level of megawatts  subject to a
demand charge on a biannual (power pool season) basis and require that a portion
of their megawatt needs be committed on a take-or-pay  basis for the entire term
of the agreement. In addition to the demand charge, each Large Power Customer is
billed an energy  charge for each  kilowatthour  used that recovers the variable
costs incurred in generating electricity.  Six of the Large Power Customers have
interruptible  service for a portion of their needs which  provides a discounted
demand  rate and  energy  priced at  Minnesota  Power's  incremental  cost after
serving all firm power  obligations.  Minnesota Power also provides  incremental
production  service for customer  demand  levels above the contract  take-or-pay
levels.  There is no demand  charge for this  service and energy is priced at an
increment  above  Minnesota  Power's  cost.  Incremental  production  service is
interruptible.  Contracts  with 11 of the 13 Large Power  Customers  provide for
deferral  without  interest of one-half of demand  charge  obligations  incurred
during the first  three  months of a strike or illegal  walkout at a  customer's
facilities,   with  repayment   required  over  the  12-month  period  following
resolution of the work stoppage.
   All contracts continue past the contract termination date unless the required
advance  notice  of  cancellation   has  been  given.   The  advance  notice  of
cancellation  varies from one to four years. Such contracts  minimize the impact
on  earnings  that  otherwise  would  result  from  significant   reductions  in
kilowatthour  sales to such  customers.  Large Power  Customers  are required to
purchase all electric service requirements from Minnesota Power for the duration
of their contracts. The rates and corresponding revenue associated with capacity
and energy provided under these contracts are subject to change through the same

UTILITY PURCHASED POWER
   Minnesota  Power has  contracts to purchase  capacity and energy from various
entities.  The largest  contract is with Square Butte.  Under an agreement  with
Square Butte, expiring at the end of 2026, Minnesota Power is currently entitled
to  approximately  71% of the  output  of a 455-MW  coal-fired  generating  unit
located near Center, North Dakota. (See Note 13.)
   In October 2000 Minnesota Power entered into a power purchase  agreement with
Great River Energy.  Under this agreement,  as amended in 2002,  Minnesota Power
purchases 240 MW beginning June 2001 until April 2003 and 80 MW from May 2003 to
October 2003 from Lakefield  Junction Station, a natural gas-fired peaking plant
located in southern Minnesota.

FUEL
   Minnesota Power  purchases  low-sulfur,  sub-bituminous  coal from the Powder
River Basin coal field located in Montana. Coal consumption in 2002 for electric
generation at Minnesota Power's  Minnesota  coal-fired  generating  stations was
about 5.3 million  tons.  As of December  31,  2002  Minnesota  Power had a coal
inventory of about 635,000 tons. Minnesota Power has four coal supply agreements
with various  expiration  dates extending  through 2006.  Under these agreements
Minnesota Power has the tonnage  flexibility to procure 70% to 100% of its total
coal  requirements.  Minnesota  Power  will  obtain  coal  in 2003  under  these
agreements  and in the spot  market.  This  mix of coal  supply  options  allows
Minnesota  Power to manage market price and supply risk and to take advantage of
favorable spot market prices.  Although Minnesota Power is exploring future coal
supply options, it believes that adequate supplies of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous
coal will continue to be available.
   The Burlington  Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company transports coal by unit
train from the Powder River Basin to Minnesota Power's generating  stations.  In
2001 Minnesota Power and Burlington  Northern  entered into a 10-year  agreement
under which Burlington Northern will ship all of Minnesota Power's coal.

   The Square Butte generating  unit  operated  by Minnkota  Power  burns  North
Dakota  lignite coal  supplied by BNI Coal,  in  accordance  with the terms of a
contract  expiring in 2027.  Square  Butte's cost of lignite  burned in 2002 was
approximately  61 cents per MBtu. The lignite acreage that has been dedicated to
Square Butte by BNI Coal is located on lands  essentially all of which are under
private  control  and  presently  leased by BNI  Coal.  This  lignite  supply is
sufficient to provide the fuel for the anticipated useful life of the generating
unit.

NONREGULATED GENERATION AND POWER MARKETING
   SPLIT ROCK  ENERGY.  Split Rock Energy LLC, is a joint  venture of  Minnesota
Power and Great River Energy. Great River Energy is a consumer-owned  generation
and transmission  cooperative and is Minnesota's second largest utility in terms
of generating  capacity.  The joint venture  combines the two  companies'  power
supply  capabilities and customer loads for power pool operations and generation
outage  protection.  Ownership of generation  assets and current customer supply
arrangements  have not changed for either company.  Split Rock Energy has access
to members' resources,  assets and financial support. Split Rock Energy provides
power marketing,  energy sourcing and risk management services to both Minnesota
Power and Great River Energy.  Split Rock Energy's risk management  policies are
consistent with Minnesota Power's.  In a volatile wholesale  marketplace,  Split
Rock Energy  mitigates  marketplace  risk while  creating  additional  marketing
opportunities for both Minnesota Power and Great River Energy.
   TACONITE  HARBOR.  In  2002  we  restarted  the  Taconite  Harbor  generating
facilities.  The  generation  output is  primarily  being sold in the  wholesale
market and is allocated in limited  circumstances  to Minnesota  Power's utility
customers.
   KENDALL COUNTY.  In September 1999 Rainy River Energy entered into an amended
15-year  power  purchase  agreement  (Kendall  County)  with a company  that was
subsequently purchased by NRG Energy, an independent power producer. The Kendall
County  agreement  includes  the  purchase  of the  output  of one  entire  unit
(approximately 275 MW) of a four unit (approximately 1,100 MW) natural gas-fired
combined cycle generation facility located near Chicago, Illinois.  Construction
of the generation  facility began in 2000 and was completed in 2002. Rainy River
Energy's  obligation to pay fixed capacity related charges began May 1, 2002. We
currently have two long-term  forward capacity and energy  contracts  related to
generation obtained through the Kendall County agreement. Each is for 50 MW with
one having a 10-year term and the other a 15-year term.  Our strategy is to sell
a significant portion of the remaining nonregulated generation through long-term
contracts  of various  durations.  Any  balance  will be sold in the spot market
through short-term agreements.
   OTHER.  In  2002  Minnesota  Power  canceled  plans  to  construct  a  225-MW
combined-heat-and-power  facility in Grand Rapids,  Minnesota,  because its cost
was too high.  Minnesota  Power also  indefinitely  delayed plans to build a $70
million  160-MW  natural  gas-fired  electric  generating  facility in Superior,
Wisconsin,  due to lack of growth in the region and the unsettled nature of both
the economy and wholesale power markets.  As a result of this indefinite  delay,
ALLETE's 2002 earnings  included a $5.5 million charge.
   In 2002 the  Company  sold 1.2 million MWh of  nonregulated  generation  (0.2
million in both 2001 and 2000).

                                     PART I


REGULATORY ISSUES
   We are exempt from regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, except as to Section 9(a)(2) which relates to acquisition of securities of
public utility companies.
   We are subject to the  jurisdiction of various  regulatory  authorities.  The
MPUC has regulatory  authority over Minnesota Power's service area in Minnesota,
retail rates,  retail  services,  issuance of securities and other matters.  The
FERC  has  jurisdiction  over  the  licensing  of  hydroelectric  projects,  the
establishment  of rates and charges for the sale of  electricity  for resale and
transmission of electricity in interstate  commerce,  and certain accounting and
record  keeping  practices.  The PSCW has  regulatory  authority over the retail
sales of  electricity,  water  and gas by  SWL&P.  The  MPUC,  FERC and PSCW had
regulatory authority over 25%, 3% and 3%, respectively, of our 2002 consolidated
operating revenue.
   ELECTRIC  RATES.  Minnesota  Power has  historically  designed  its  electric
service rates based on cost of service studies under which  allocations are made
to the various  classes of customers.  Nearly all retail sales  include  billing
adjustment  clauses which adjust electric  service rates for changes in the cost
of fuel  and  purchased  energy,  and  recovery  of  current  and  deferred  CIP
expenditures.
   In addition  to Large  Power  Customer  contracts,  Minnesota  Power also has
contracts with large industrial and commercial customers with monthly demands of
more than 2 MW but less  than 10 MW of  capacity.  The terms of these  contracts
vary depending  upon the  customer's  demand for power and the cost of extending
Minnesota Power's facilities to provide electric service.
   Minnesota Power requires that all large  industrial and commercial  customers
under contract specify the date when power is first required, and thereafter the
customer  is billed  monthly  for at least  the  minimum  power  for which  they
contracted.  These  conditions  are part of all contracts  covering  power to be
supplied  to new  large  industrial  and  commercial  customers  and to  current
customers as their contracts expire or are amended. All rates and other contract
terms are subject to approval by appropriate regulatory authorities.
   FEDERAL ENERGY  REGULATORY  COMMISSION.  The FERC has  jurisdiction  over our
wholesale  electric  service and  operations.  Minnesota  Power's  hydroelectric
facilities,  which are located in  Minnesota,  are  licensed  by the FERC.  (See
Environmental Matters - Water.)
   Minnesota  Power has  long-term  contracts  with 16 Minnesota  municipalities
receiving  wholesale  electric  service.  Two contracts are for service  through
2005,  while the other 14 are for service  through at least 2007.  All contracts
limit FERC rate increases on a cumulative  basis.  In 2002  municipal  customers
purchased 715,000 MWh from Minnesota Power.
   In  February  2001  Minnesota  Power and  SWL&P  became  members  of the MISO
pursuant to FERC's Order No. 2000 and Wisconsin  state law.  Minnesota Power and
SWL&P retain ownership of their respective  transmission assets and control area
functions,  but now  operate  their  transmission  network  under  the  regional
operational control of the MISO and take and provide  transmission service under
the MISO open access  transmission  tariff.  In December  2001 FERC approved the
MISO as the nation's first regional transmission  organization (RTO) under Order
No. 2000  criteria,  noting that it  believes  the MISO will  benefit the public
interest  by  enhancing  the  reliability  of  the  Midwest  electric  grid  and
facilitating and enhancing wholesale competition.  The MISO will accomplish this
primarily through standardization of rates, terms and conditions of transmission
service  over a broad  region  encompassing  all or parts of 20  states  and one
Canadian province,  and over 120,000 MW of generating capacity.  MISO operations
were phased in during the first half of 2002.
   The FERC is currently  developing rules for a standard market design intended
to further  define the functions and  transmission  tariff of the MISO and other
regional transmission providers. The MISO has filed proposed energy market rules
with FERC for day-ahead and real time energy markets and financial  transmission
rights. The MISO has requested assurances from FERC that all start-up costs will
be recoverable from market participants.
   Minnesota Power also participates in MAPP, a power pool operating in parts of
eight  states  in the Upper  Midwest  and in three  provinces  in  Canada.  MAPP
functions  include a regional  reliability  council  that  maintains  generation
reserve sharing requirements and a wholesale power and energy market committee.
   MINNESOTA PUBLIC  UTILITIES  COMMISSION.  Minnesota  Power's retail rates are
based on a 1994 MPUC retail rate order that allows for an 11.6% return on common
equity dedicated to utility plant.
   Minnesota  requires  investor owned electric  utilities to spend a minimum of
1.5% of gross annual retail electric revenue on CIP each year. These investments
are recovered  from retail  customers  through a billing  adjustment and amounts
included in retail base rates.  The MPUC allows  utilities to  accumulate,  in a
deferred account for future recovery, all CIP expenditures as well as a carrying
charge  on  the  deferred  account  balance.  Minnesota  Power's  2000/2001  CIP
investment  goal was $2.7 million each year with actual spending at $1.9 million
and $2.6 million, respectively.  Minnesota Power's 2002/2003 CIP investment goal
is $2.9 million each year.  During 2002  Minnesota  Power  invested $4.0 million
which  satisfied  current  spending  requirements  and all prior years' spending
shortfalls.
   PUBLIC  SERVICE  COMMISSION OF WISCONSIN.  SWL&P's  current  retail rates are
based on a September 2001 PSCW retail rate order that allows for a 12.25% return
on common  equity.
   In May 2002  SWL&P  filed an  application  with  the  PSCW for  authority  to
increase retail utility rates 4.5%. This average increase is comprised of a 6.8%
increase in gas rates, a 19.2% increase in water rates and no change in electric
rates. The

                                     PART I


proposed  increases are due in part to the completion of  construction  projects
that added a second gas supply line into  Superior,  Wisconsin,  and replaced an
aging well system in the water  utility.  SWL&P is requesting a 12.25% return on
common  equity.  Hearings  have been held and a final  order is  expected in the
spring of 2003.
   Minnesota Power, the American Transmission Company (ATC) and Wisconsin Public
Service Corporation,  filed new cost estimates with the PSCW estimating that the
Wausau-to-Duluth  electric transmission line will cost $396 million. When it was
proposed,  the line had been projected to cost about $215 million. The increased
costs for the  220-mile,  345-kV  line are  attributable  to higher  prices  for
construction  materials,  increased  payments  to  landowners,  more  aggressive
environmental  safeguards and a different estimating system used by ATC. Despite
the cost increase,  Minnesota  Power and  transmission  planners  throughout the
region  believe the  transmission  line is  necessary.  Minnesota  Power will be
actively  involved in the permitting and construction  activities;  however,  it
does not intend to finance nor own the proposed line.
   The PSCW must approve the ownership,  control and operation of any affiliated
wholesale nonregulated  generating plants in Wisconsin.  (See Wholesale Electric
Sales.)

COMPETITION
   INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING. State and federal efforts to restructure the electric
utility  industry  have  slowed  amid  concerns  fueled by  California's  retail
competition  experience  and  Enron  Corp.'s  collapse,  among  others.  At  the
wholesale level, the FERC is in the midst of a major rulemaking  called Standard
Market  Design  (SMD).  Once  implemented,   SMD  should  facilitate   wholesale
transactions  by  improving  the   functionality   of  the  wholesale   electric
transmission market.
   New federal  legislation  has been proposed  that,  among other things and in
concert with the FERC's efforts, aims to maintain reliability,  assures adequate
energy  supply  and  addresses  wholesale  price  volatility  while  encouraging
wholesale competition.  Legislation or regulation that initiates a process which
may lead to retail customer choice of their electric service provider  currently
lacks momentum in both Minnesota and  Wisconsin.  Federal and state  legislative
and regulatory activity,  as well as the actions of competitors,  affect the way
Minnesota Power strategically plans for its future. We cannot predict the timing
or substance of any future legislation or regulation.

FRANCHISES
   Minnesota  Power  holds  franchises  to  construct  and  maintain an electric
distribution and  transmission  system in 90 cities and towns located within its
electric service territory. SWL&P holds similar franchises for electric, natural
gas and/or water  systems in 15 cities and towns  within its service  territory.
The  remaining  cities and towns  served do not require a  franchise  to operate
within their boundaries.  Our exclusive  service  territories are established by
state regulatory agencies.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
   Certain  businesses  included in our Energy  Services  segment are subject to
regulation by various federal, state and local authorities of air quality, water
quality,  solid  wastes  and other  environmental  matters.  We  consider  these
businesses to be in substantial compliance with those environmental  regulations
currently  applicable to their  operations and believe all necessary  permits to
conduct such operations have been obtained.  Environmental  laws and regulations
are constantly  evolving.  Due to their  uncertainty,  the character,  scope and
ultimate  costs of  emerging  environmental  compliance  requirements  cannot be
estimated.
   AIR.  Minnesota  Power's  generating  facilities  in  Minnesota  burn  mainly
low-sulfur  western  sub-bituminous  coal and  Square  Butte,  located  in North
Dakota,  burns lignite coal. All of these facilities are equipped with pollution
control equipment such as scrubbers,  baghouses or electrostatic  precipitators.
The federal Clean Air Act  Amendments  of 1990 (Clean Air Act) created  emission
allowances for sulfur dioxide.  Each allowance is an  authorization  to emit one
ton of sulfur dioxide, and each utility must have sufficient allowances to cover
its annual emissions.  Sulfur dioxide emission  requirements are currently being
met by all of Minnesota  Power's  generating  facilities.  Most Minnesota  Power
facilities have surplus  allowances.  Taconite Harbor expects to meet its sulfur
dioxide  requirements by annually  purchasing  allowances,  since it receives no
allowance  allocation.  Square  Butte  anticipates  meeting  its sulfur  dioxide
requirements  through  increased  use of  existing  scrubbers  and  by  annually
purchasing additional allowances as necessary.
   In accordance with the Clean Air Act, the EPA has established  nitrogen oxide
limitations for electric  generating units. To meet nitrogen oxide  limitations,
Minnesota Power installed advanced low-emission burner technology and associated
control  equipment to operate the Boswell and Laskin  facilities at or below the
compliance emission limits. Nitrogen oxide limitations at Square Butte are being
met by combustion tuning.
   Minnesota Power has obtained all necessary Title V air operating permits from
the MPCA for its applicable facilities to conduct electric operations.
   In December 2000 the EPA announced its decision to regulate mercury emissions
from coal and  oil-fired  power plants  under  Section 112 of the Clean Air Act.
Section 112 will require all such power plants in the United States to adhere to
the EPA maximum  achievable  control  technology  (MACT)  standards for mercury.
Final regulations  defining control  requirements are planned for December 2004.
Cost estimates would be premature at this time.
   In May 2002 Minnesota  Power received and  subsequently  responded to a third
request from the EPA, under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act, seeking additional
information

regarding  capital  expenditures at all of its coal-fired  generating  stations.
This action is part of an industry-wide  investigation assessing compliance with
the New Source Review  and  the  New  Source  Performance  Standards  (emissions
standards  that apply to new and changed units) of the Clean Air Act at electric
generating  stations.  We are  unable to predict  whether  the EPA will take any
action on this matter or whether  Minnesota  Power will be required to incur any
costs as a result.
   In December  2002 the EPA issued  changes to the existing  New Source  Review
rules.  These changes are not expected to result in any  significant  additional
costs to Minnesota Power. The EPA also proposed changes  clarifying  application
of  certain  sections  of the  New  Source  Review  rules.  Minnesota  Power  is
evaluating the proposal.  After taking  comments in early 2003, the EPA plans to
go through a new rule making process over the next one to two years.
   In June 2002 Minnkota Power, the operator of Square Butte,  received a Notice
of Violation from the EPA regarding  alleged New Source Review violations at the
M.R.  Young Station which  includes the Square Butte  generating  unit.  The EPA
claims  certain  capital  projects  completed by Minnkota Power should have gone
through the New Source Review  process  potentially  resulting in new air permit
operating  conditions.  The  Company  is unable to predict  the  outcome of this
matter  or the  magnitude  of costs  should  additional  pollution  controls  be
required.  Minnesota  Power is  obligated  to pay its pro rata  share of  Square
Butte's  costs  based on  Minnesota  Power's  entitlement  to the  Square  Butte
generating unit's output. (See Note 13.)
   WATER. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (FWPCA), as amended by
the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water Quality Act of 1987,  established  the
National  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System (NPDES) permit program.  The
FWPCA  requires  NPDES permits to be obtained from the EPA (or, when  delegated,
from individual state pollution control agencies) for any wastewater  discharged
into navigable waters. Minnesota Power has obtained all necessary NPDES permits,
including  NPDES storm water permits for applicable  facilities,  to conduct its
electric operations.
   Minnesota  Power holds FERC licenses  authorizing the ownership and operation
of seven  hydroelectric  generating projects with a total generating capacity of
about 115 MW. In June 1996  Minnesota  Power filed in the U.S.  Court of Appeals
for the  District  of Columbia  Circuit a petition  for review of the license as
issued by the FERC for Minnesota Power's St. Louis River Hydro Project. Separate
petitions for review were also filed by the U.S.  Department of the Interior and
the  Fond  du Lac  Band  of Lake  Superior  Chippewa  (Fond  du Lac  Band),  two
intervenors  in the  licensing  proceedings.  The court  consolidated  the three
petitions for review and suspended the briefing  schedule while  Minnesota Power
and the Fond du Lac Band negotiate the reasonable fee for use of tribal lands as
mandated  by the new  license.  Both  parties  informed  the  court  that  these
negotiations may resolve other disputed issues, and they are obligated to report
periodically  to the court the status of these  discussions.  Beginning in 1996,
and most recently in January 2002,  Minnesota Power filed requests with the FERC
for extensions of time to comply with certain plans and studies  required by the
license that might  conflict with the  settlement  discussions.  The Fond du Lac
Band and Minnesota  Power have reached a confidential  settlement  agreement for
the St. Louis River Hydro Project and have  included the U.S.  Department of the
Interior  in the  settlement  process  in an effort to  achieve a  comprehensive
agreement  with all  intervening  parties  to the  project  license.  Any  final
settlement  must be  approved  by the FERC,  who would  then  amend the  project
license in accordance with the settlement agreement.
   SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTE. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976
regulates the management and disposal of solid wastes and hazardous wastes. As a
result of this  legislation,  the EPA has  promulgated  various  hazardous waste
rules. Minnesota Power is required to notify the EPA of hazardous waste activity
and routinely  submits the necessary annual reports to the EPA. The MPCA and the
Wisconsin   Department  of  Natural   Resources   (WDNR)  are   responsible  for
administering  solid and hazardous waste rules on the state level with oversight
by the EPA.
   During 2002 Minnesota Power constructed a dry ash disposal landfill to handle
ash generated from Taconite Harbor. The landfill cost approximately $800,000.
   In response to EPA Region V's request for  utilities  to  participate  in the
Great  Lakes  Initiative  by  voluntarily  removing  remaining   polychlorinated
biphenyl  (PCB)  inventories,  Minnesota  Power  has  scheduled  replacement  of
PCB-contaminated  oil by the end of 2004. The total cost is expected to be about
$2.0 million of which $1.3 million was spent through December 31, 2002.
   In May 2001 SWL&P received notice from the WDNR that the City of Superior had
found soil contamination on property  adjoining a former  Manufactured Gas Plant
(MGP) site owned and  operated by SWL&P's  predecessors  from 1889 to 1904.  The
WDNR requested an environmental investigation be initiated. The WDNR also issued
SWL&P a Responsible  Party letter in February  2002 to initiate  tracking of the
project  in  the  WDNR  database  so  that   progress  can  be  monitored.   The
environmental investigation is underway and the Company is unable to predict the
outcome of this matter at this time.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES

   Automotive Services includes several  subsidiaries that are integral parts of
the vehicle redistribution  business.  Automotive Services plans to grow through
increased sales at existing businesses, selective acquisitions in both wholesale
and total loss vehicle  auction  facilities,  integration  of total loss vehicle
services at certain  wholesale  vehicle  auction  facilities  and  expansion  of
services to customers.  The discussion  below summarizes the major businesses we
include in  Automotive  Services.  Statistical  information  is  presented as of
December 31, 2002 unless otherwise indicated.  All subsidiaries are wholly owned
unless otherwise specifically indicated.
   ADESA is the  second  largest  wholesale  vehicle  auction  network  in North
America.  Headquartered  in  Indianapolis,  Indiana,  ADESA owns (or leases) and
operates 52 wholesale vehicle auction facilities in the United States and Canada
through  which used cars and other  vehicles are sold to  franchised  automobile
dealers and licensed used car dealers.  Initiated in 2002,  ADESA holds auctions
in Mexico  City,  Mexico,  in  partnership  with Ford  Motor  Company  at Ford's
facilities.  Sellers at ADESA's  auctions  include  domestic  and  foreign  auto
manufacturers,  car dealers, automotive fleet/lease companies, banks and finance
companies.  During the sales  process,  ADESA does not  typically  take title to
vehicles.
   The table on the next page  lists the  wholesale  vehicle  auctions  owned or
leased by ADESA. Each auction is a multi-lane,  drive-through  facility, and has
additional buildings for reconditioning,  registration,  maintenance,  bodywork,
and other ancillary and  administrative  services.  Each auction also has secure
parking areas to store vehicles for auction.
   New facilities are under construction in Atlanta,  Georgia;  Long Island, New
York; and Edmonton,  Alberta. The new facility in Long Island is a greenfield (a
newly constructed facility in a new market), while the new facilities in Atlanta
and Edmonton will replace  aging  facilities  that are too small to  efficiently
serve our growing customer demand. All three are expected to open in 2003.
   ADESA  IMPACT in the U.S.  and  IMPACT  AUTO in  Canada,  collectively  ADESA
Impact, represent the third largest total loss vehicle service business in North
America.  They provide total loss vehicle  auction  services to the property and
casualty  insurance  industry,  and vehicle  leasing  and rental car  companies.
Buyers reclaim and recycle total loss vehicles. ADESA Impact provides total loss
vehicle claim  services such as vehicle  appraisals,  inspections,  evaluations,
titling and settlement  administration  to its clients.  Auto imaging,  Internet
bidding and vehicle enhancement  services are provided through an array of total
loss management  programs.  ADESA Impact has 25 total loss auction facilities in
the United States and Canada.  United States  operations  are  headquartered  in
Indianapolis,  Indiana,  and Canadian  operations are  headquartered in Toronto,
Ontario.
   COMSEARCH provides  professional  claim outsourcing  services to the property
and casualty insurance industry and is the nation's largest automobile  recycled
part  locating  service,  processing  over  100,000 part  searches a month.  Our
locating service has over 2,300 customers. ComSearch's services complement ADESA
Impact's business. ComSearch is headquartered in Warren, Rhode Island.
   AFC provides inventory financing for automobile dealers who purchase vehicles
from ADESA  auctions,  independent  auctions,  other auction  chains and outside
sources. AFC is headquartered in Indianapolis,  Indiana,  and, as of February 1,
2003,  has 81 loan  production  offices at or near auto  auctions  across  North
America.  These offices provide qualified dealers credit to purchase vehicles at
any of the 500 plus auctions and other outside  sources  approved by AFC.  AFC's
computer-based  system  follows each loan from  origination to payoff and allows
AFC to better manage its business,  while expediting services through its branch
network to 17,000 registered dealers.
   PAR,  which is doing  business  as PAR  North  America,  provides  customized
vehicle  remarketing  services  to various  companies  such as banks,  non-prime
finance companies,  captive finance,  leasing  companies,  commercial fleets and
rental car  companies  throughout  the United  States.  PAR's  services  include
nationwide repossessions,  remarketing, pre- and post-term lease-end management,
50-state titling services and Canadian  registrations turned to U.S. titles. PAR
offers its telemarketing  service through its affiliate company,  EndTrust.  PAR
has its headquarters in Carmel, Indiana.
   AUTOVIN provides technology-enabled vehicle inspection services and inventory
auditing  to  the  automotive  industry  and  the  industry's  secured  lenders.
AutoVIN's services include vehicle condition reporting,  inventory  verification
auditing, program compliance auditing and facility inspection.

COMPETITION
   In the wholesale  vehicle  market,  ADESA competes with Manheim  Auctions,  a
subsidiary  of Cox  Enterprises,  Inc.,  as well as  several  smaller  chains of
auctions,  and independent  auctions some of which are affiliated  through their
membership in an industry organization named ServNet(R). Due to ADESA's national
presence,  competition is strongest with Manheim for the supply of vehicles from
the national level accounts such as manufacturers,  fleet/lease companies, banks
and finance companies.  Although the supply of these vehicles is dispersed among
all of the auctions in the wholesale vehicle market, ADESA competes most heavily
with the independent  auctions (as well as Manheim and all others in the market)
for the supply of  vehicles  from both the  franchised  used car dealers and the
independent used car dealers. Due to the increased acceptance of e-business as a
standard  business  practice,  new  competition  has arisen  over the years from
Internet-based  companies and our own customers who supply vehicles for auction.

competes for these  customers by attempting to attract a large number of dealers
to purchase vehicles,  which ensures  competitive prices and supports the volume
of vehicles  auctioned.  ADESA is also  competitive by providing a full range of
automotive  services,  including  dealer  inventory  financing,   reconditioning
services that prepare vehicles for auction and processing of sales transactions.
   Other factors affect the  competition for supply of vehicles sold at auction.
The rental car market has yet to re-fleet up to levels  prior to  September  11,
2001,   and   manufacturer   incentives   on  new  vehicles   temporarily,   but
significantly, disrupted the price spreads between new and used vehicles. During
most of 2002 and into 2003 aggressive  financing  incentives  offered by vehicle
manufacturers have lowered the cost of owning a new vehicle, which, in turn, has
depressed  prices for  late-model  used  vehicles.  This  reduced  the number of
vehicles sold at auctions because car dealers  restocked their  inventories from
the increased  volume of  late-model  vehicles  traded in for new vehicles,  and
sellers at auction tended to hold their vehicles rather than immediately  accept
the  lower  prices.  Vehicle  manufacturers  have  also  begun  to  offer  their
end-of-term   lease  vehicles  and  other  program   vehicles  for  sale  online
electronically  prior to the  vehicles  being  offered  for  sale at a  physical
auction location. As a result, there has been a negative effect on the value and
quantity of the vehicles that are offered for sale at ADESA auction facilities.
   ADESA  utilizes  e-commerce  as another  component  in its array of services.
Dealers are  provided  training  on how to use online  products,  including  the
purchase of vehicles  online.  The dealers can also access auction  runlists and
other market report information offered on ADESA's website, www.adesa.com. ADESA
believes it has a  competitive  advantage in a small but growing  segment of the
used vehicle  market  combining  online  services  with auction  facilities  and
knowledgeable auction personnel located across North America.
   AFC is the largest  provider of dealer  floorplan  financing  to  independent
automobile dealers in North America.  AFC's competition includes other specialty
lenders,  banks and other financial  institutions.  AFC has distinguished itself
from its competitors by convenience of payment,  quality of service and scope of
services offered.
   PAR  provides  customized  remarketing  services  throughout  North  America.
Although other providers are larger in size and volume,  PAR's competition comes
from a handful of similar service providers, none of which offer as many diverse
services. PAR offers an interactive website, electronically connecting customers
with its services and includes  interactive  connection with repossession agents
and  auction  vendor  networks.  PAR's  affiliation  with  EndTrust  gives  it a
competitive  edge in gaining market share in the lease-end  management  services
arena.
   In the total loss vehicle market, ADESA Impact competes against Copart, Inc.,
Insurance  Auto  Auctions,   Inc.,  independent  auctions,  some  of  which  are
affiliated   through  their  membership  in  an  industry   organization   named
SADISCO(R),  and wholesale  vehicle auctions that regularly  remarket total loss
vehicles  in certain  locations.  Additionally,  the  dismantlers  of total loss
vehicles and internet  based  companies  have entered the market thus  providing
alternate  avenues for the suppliers to remarket their total loss  vehicles.  We
believe  through  strategic  acquisitions,  shared  facilities  with ADESA,  and
greenfield  expansion  that  ADESA  Impact  can  become a  prominent  total loss
services  provider to the insurance  industry in the United  States.  We believe
further  consolidation of the total loss vehicle auction industry will occur and
are  evaluating  various  means by which we can  continue  our growth  plan.  In
Canada, ADESA Impact is the largest provider of total loss vehicle services. Its
competitors  include auto recyclers and dismantlers,  independent auto auctions,
brokers  and  Internet   auction   companies.   ADESA  Impact   believes  it  is
strategically  positioned  in this  niche  market in  providing  a full array of
value-added  services to its  insurance  clients  including  auctions,  Internet
programs, data analyses, consultation, the services of ComSearch and other total
loss vehicle services throughout North America.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
   Certain  businesses  in  our  Automotive  Services  segment  are  subject  to
regulation  by  various  federal,  state and local  authorities  concerning  air
quality,  water  quality,  solid  wastes  and other  environmental  matters.  We
consider  these   businesses  to  be  in  substantial   compliance   with  those
environmental  regulations  currently applicable to their operations and believe
all necessary  permits to conduct such operations have been obtained.  We do not
currently  anticipate  that potential  capital  expenditures  for  environmental
matters will be material.  However,  because  environmental laws and regulations
are  constantly   evolving,   the   character,   scope  and  ultimate  costs  of
environmental compliance cannot be estimated.

                                     PART I


INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES

   Our  Investments  and  Corporate  Charges  segment  consists  of real  estate
operations, investments in emerging technologies related to the electric utility
industry and corporate  charges.  Corporate  Charges represent general corporate
expenses,  including  interest,  not  specifically  related to any one  business
segment. The trading securities portfolio, previously a significant part of this
segment,  was liquidated  during the third quarter of 2002. The discussion below
summarizes  the  major  components  of the  Investments  and  Corporate  Charges
segment.  Statistical  information  is  presented as of December 31, 2002 unless
otherwise noted. All subsidiaries are wholly owned unless otherwise specifically
indicated.
   REAL  ESTATE  OPERATIONS.  Our real  estate  operations  include  CAPE  CORAL
HOLDINGS,  INC.; PALM COAST LAND, LLC; PALM COAST FOREST,  LLC; TOMOKA HOLDINGS,
LLC;  WINTER HAVEN CITI CENTRE,  LLC;  and an 80%  ownership in LEHIGH.  Through
subsidiaries, we own Florida real estate operations in six different locations:
   - Lehigh Acres with 1,000 acres of residential  and commercial  land, east of
     Fort Myers,  Florida;
   - Cape Coral,  located west of Fort Myers,  Florida, with 185 acres of mostly
     commercially  zoned land;
   - Palm Coast, a planned community  between St.  Augustine and  Daytona Beach,
     Florida,  with 16,000 acres of residential,commercial and industrial land;
   - Tomoka,  located near Ormand Beach, Florida with 6,200 acres of property;
   - Winter Haven, located in central Florida, with a retail shopping center and
     several  parcels of land adjacent to the shopping center that are available
     for sale; and
   - Sugarmill Woods with 330 home sites and some commercially and residentially
     zoned acreage in Citrus County,  Florida.
   Our real  estate  operations  may,  from time to time,  acquire  packages  of
diversified  properties  at low cost,  then add value through  entitlements  and
infrastructure enhancements, and sell the properties at current market prices.
   EMERGING  TECHNOLOGY  INVESTMENTS.  From 1985 through  2002 we have  invested
$49.9 million in start-up  companies which are developing  technologies that may
be utilized by the  electric  utility  industry.  We are  committed to invest an
additional $7.7 million  through 2007. The  investments  were first made through
emerging  technology funds (Funds) initiated by other electric utilities and us.
More recently,  we have made  investments  directly in privately held companies.
The  majority  of  our  direct  investments  relate  to  distributed  generation
technology,  such as micro  generation and fuel cell  technology.  Many of these
direct investments are also investments in the Funds' portfolios.
   The Funds have also made  investments  in  companies  that  develop  advanced
technologies to be used by the utility industry, including  electrotechnologies,
renewable  energy  technologies,  and software and  communications  technologies
related to utility customer support systems.
   Several of the companies in the Funds'  portfolios  completed  initial public
offerings (IPOs) in 2000. Subsequent to the public trading of the IPO companies,
the Funds will, in some instances,  distribute  publicly  tradable shares to us.
Some restrictions on sale may apply, including,  but not limited to, underwriter
lock-up  periods  that  typically  extend  for 180  days  following  an IPO.  As
companies  included in our emerging  technology  investments  are sold,  we will
recognize a gain or loss.
   Since going public,  the market value of the publicly traded  investments has
experienced significant volatility.  Our direct investment in the companies that
have gone public had a cost basis of  approximately  $10 million at December 31,
2002 ($7 million at December  31,  2001).  The  aggregate  market value of these
investments  at December 31, 2002 was  approximately  $6 million ($12 million at
December 31, 2001).
   We also have several  minority  investments  in the Funds and  privately-held
start-up  companies.  These  investments are accounted for under the cost method
and included with  Investments  on our  consolidated  balance  sheet.  The total
carrying  value of these  investments  was $38.7  million at  December  31, 2002
($40.6 million at December 31, 2001).
   Our policy is to  periodically  review these  investments  for  impairment by
assessing such factors as continued commercial viability of products,  cash flow
and earnings. Any impairment would reduce the carrying value of the investment.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
   Certain businesses  included in our Investments and Corporate Charges segment
are  subject to  regulation  by  various  federal,  state and local  authorities
concerning  air quality,  water  quality,  solid wastes and other  environmental
matters. We consider these businesses to be in substantial compliance with those
environmental  regulations  currently applicable to their operations and believe
all necessary  permits to conduct such operations have been obtained.  We do not
currently  anticipate  that potential  capital  expenditures  for  environmental
matters will be material.  However,  because  environmental laws and regulations
are  constantly   evolving,   the   character,   scope  and  ultimate  costs  of
environmental compliance cannot be estimated.

ITEM 5.  MARKET  FOR THE  REGISTRANT'S  COMMON  EQUITY AND  RELATED  STOCKHOLDER
         MATTERS

   We have paid dividends without interruption on our common stock since 1948. A
quarterly  dividend  of $0.2825  per share on our  common  stock will be paid on
March 1, 2003 to the holders of record on February 15, 2003. Our common stock is
listed on the New York Stock Exchange  under the symbol ALE.  Dividends paid per
share,  and the  high  and low  prices  for our  common  stock  for the  periods
indicated as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on its NYSEnet website, are
in the accompanying chart.
   The amount and timing of dividends payable on our common stock are within the
sole  discretion of our Board of  Directors.  In 2002 we paid out 66% of our per
share earnings in dividends.
   Our  Articles  of  Incorporation,  and  Mortgage  and Deed of  Trust  contain
provisions  which under  certain  circumstances  would  restrict  the payment of
common  stock  dividends.  As of December  31, 2002 no  retained  earnings  were
restricted  as a result of these  provisions.  At  January  31,  2003 there were
approximately 38,000 common stock shareholders of record.

   During 2002 we accomplished several important goals. We began simplifying our
Company  by  exiting  non-strategic   businesses  and  liquidating  the  trading
securities portfolio.  In doing so we will strengthen our balance sheet. We also
made  progress on the sale of our Water  Services  businesses  and continued our
efforts to communicate to investors our focus on our two core businesses, Energy
Services and Automotive Services.
   Net income and earnings per share for 2002 decreased 1% and 7%, respectively,
from the same period in 2001.  Factors  reflected in the comparison of 2002 with
2001 include:
   -   CHARGES. Net income for  2002 included $9.4 million of charges related to
       our exit  from non-strategic  businesses  and the  indefinite  delay of a
       generation project in Superior, Wisconsin ($4.4 million in 2001).
   -   GOODWILL. Earnings for 2001 included $11.3 million, or  $0.15  per share,
       of  goodwill  amortization expense. As  required  by  SFAS 142,  goodwill
       amortization was discontinued in 2002.
   -   REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION. Earnings for 2001 included an $11.1 million,  or
       $0.15 per share, gain associated with our largest ever single real estate
       transaction.
   -   COMMON STOCK ISSUANCE. The decrease in earnings per share was in part due
       to the issuance of 6.6 million shares of our common stock in  the  second
       quarter of 2001.
   We measure  performance  of our  operations  through  careful  budgeting  and
monitoring of contributions to consolidated net income by each business segment.

NET INCOME

   ENERGY SERVICES. Net income was down $9.9 million, or 19%, in 2002. Excluding
a charge  related to the indefinite  delay of a generation  project in Superior,
Wisconsin,  net income was down $4.4 million,  or 8%. The decrease was primarily
due to weak wholesale  power prices which  negatively  impacted  wholesale power
marketing activities. In 2001 our wholesale power marketing activities were more
profitable  due to warmer summer  weather and overall  market  conditions.  Weak
wholesale  power prices in 2002 more than offset the  positive  impact of an 11%
increase in megawatthour  sales.  Total  megawatthour sales were 12.3 million in
2002 (11.1 million in 2001; 11.9 million in 2000). The megawatthour increase was
mainly  attributable to about 500 MW of nonregulated  wholesale  generation that
came online in 2002; 1.2 million  megawatthours of nonregulated  generation were
sold in 2002 (0.2  million  in both 2001 and 2000).  Megawatthour  sales in 2001
reflected decreased sales to our taconite customers because of planned shutdowns
and reduced taconite  production.  Net income in 2001 also included the recovery
of $2.6 million for 1998 CIP lost margins.
   AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES. Net income in 2002 increased $18.1 million, or 24%, over
2001.  The  continued  growth in net  income  during  2002 was due to a mandated
goodwill amortization accounting change, lower interest expense and

improved  operating  efficiencies,  while during 2001 and 2000  acquisitions and
increased sales at both ADESA and AFC were the contributing factors. During 2001
ADESA  acquired or opened 13 auction  facilities (10 in 2000) that provide total
loss vehicle services to insurance  companies,  and added one wholesale  vehicle
auction facility (28 in 2000).
   At ADESA wholesale auction  facilities 1.7 million vehicles were sold in 2002
(1.8 million in 2001;  1.3 million in 2000).  Volumes were lower in 2002 because
the rental car market has yet to  re-fleet  up to levels  prior to the events of
September 11, 2001, and manufacturer incentives on new vehicles temporarily, but
significantly,  disrupted  the  price  spreads  between  new and used  vehicles.
Aggressive  financing  incentives offered by vehicle  manufacturers  lowered the
cost of owning a new vehicle,  which, in turn,  depressed  prices for late-model
used vehicles.  This reduced the number of vehicles sold at auctions because car
dealers  restocked  their  inventories  from the increased  volume of late-model
vehicles traded in for new vehicles, and sellers at auction tended to hold their
vehicles  rather than  immediately  accept the lower prices.  In 2001  increased
costs and  reduced  sales  volumes  because of  inclement  weather in early 2001
hampered  financial  results,  as did the  events of  September  11. For 2001 we
estimated  that the  impact of the events of  September  11  resulted  in a $3.5
million decrease to net income.  Costs of assimilating the 28 wholesale  vehicle
auction facilities acquired or opened in 2000 also impacted 2001 results.
   Conversion rates are the percentage of vehicles sold from those that were run
through  auction  lanes.  We  achieved  a 59%  conversion  rate  related  to our
wholesale vehicles sold for 2002 (58% for 2001; 59% for 2000).
   Despite unseasonably dry weather conditions in 2002 which usually means fewer
total loss  vehicles,  the  number of  vehicles  sold at our total loss  vehicle
auction  facilities  was higher in 2002  reflecting  expansion into new markets,
which  included  adding  total loss  auctions at some of our  wholesale  vehicle
auction  facilities.  At our total loss vehicle  auctions  175,000 vehicles were
sold in 2002 (148,000 in 2001; 33,000 in 2000).
   AFC contributed  38% of the net income from Automotive  Services in 2002 (40%
in 2001;  47% in 2000).  AFC has 81 loan  production  offices (82 in 2001; 86 in
2000). The growth of AFC's dealer/customer base from 15,000 in 2000 to 17,000 in
2002 has enabled AFC to finance more vehicles; 946,000 vehicles in 2002 (904,000
in 2001;  795,000 in 2000).  AFC managed  total  receivables  of $495 million at
December 31, 2002 ($500  million at December 31, 2001;  $436 million at December
31, 2000).
   INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE  CHARGES  reported $19.5 million less net income in
2002 due to smaller real estate  transactions in 2002 and the liquidation of the
trading securities portfolio in the second half of 2002. In 2001 our real estate
operations  reported  stronger  sales  including  an $11.1  million  gain on its
largest single sale ever.  Our trading  securities  portfolio  earned a negative
1.5%  after-tax  annualized  return prior to  liquidation  in 2002 compared to a
positive 5.6% in 2001 (7.0% in 2000). The 2001 return on our trading  securities
portfolio reflected earnings on a lower average balance.  During 2000 we reduced
the size of our trading  securities  portfolio  to  partially  fund  significant
acquisitions made by Automotive  Services.  Net income in 2000 reflected a $30.4
million, or $0.44 per share, after-tax gain on the sale of 4.7 million shares of
ACE that we received in 1999 when Capital Re merged with ACE.
   Corporate  charges in 2002 and 2001 reflected  higher  interest  expense as a
result of debt issued to fund  strategic  initiatives  in early 2001.  Incentive
compensation expenses,  however, were lower in 2002. The decrease was attributed
in part to lower 2002  earnings.  Also,  2001 included  additional  expenses for
severance  packages.  In 2000  financial  results  reflected  the  resolution of
various federal and state tax issues which increased net income.
   DISCONTINUED  OPERATIONS included the operating results of our Water Services
businesses,  which are currently held for sale, our auto transport  business and
our retail store.
   Income from  discontinued  operations was up $9.8 million from 2001 primarily
due to the suspension of depreciation on our Water Services  assets. Income from
discontinued  operations included $7.5 million of depreciation expense after tax
in 2001 ($8.1 million in 2000).
   Our Water Services  businesses  reported an 8% increase in water  consumption
during 2002 as a result of drier weather  conditions  and  increased  customers.
Organic  customer growth was 4.5% in 2002.  Strategic  acquisitions and customer
growth  since  1999  within  our Water  Services  businesses  helped  temper the
negative  financial  impact  of  above-average  rainfall  in  Florida  and North
Carolina  during the majority of 2001 and  conservation  efforts in Florida.  In
addition,  operating  results for Water Services  reflected gains related to the
disposal of certain assets in 2001, an October 2000 rate increase implemented by
Heater Utilities, Inc. and regulatory relief granted in Florida in 2000.
   Income from  discontinued  operations  also  reflected  $3.9  million of exit
charges associated with the auto transport business and the retail store in 2002
and a $4.4 million charge to exit the auto transport business in 2001.

Kendall County power purchase agreement,  a 15-year agreement with NRG Energy at
a  facility  near  Chicago,  Illinois.
   OPERATING REVENUE in total was up $11.6 million,  or 2%, in 2002 as increased
revenue  from  nonregulated/nonutility  operations  was  partially  offset  by a
decrease in utility revenue.  Despite a slight increase in utility  megawatthour
sales,  utility revenue  decreased $33.1 million,  or 6%, due to lower wholesale
prices and fuel clause recoveries. Fuel clause recoveries decreased due to lower
purchased power costs in 2002. Total utility  megawatthour sales were up 2% over
the prior year  reflecting  increased  retail  sales to taconite  customers.  In
addition, utility revenue in 2001 included the recovery of $4.5 million for 1998
CIP lost margins.  Nonregulated/nonutility  revenue increased $44.7 million,  or
56%, in 2002  primarily as a result of about 500 MW of  nonregulated  generation
that came online in 2002.  There were 1.2 million  megawatthours of nonregulated
generation sold in 2002.
   OPERATING  EXPENSES  in  total  increased  $30.2  million,  or 6%,  in  2002.
Excluding the charge related to the indefinite delay of a generation  project in
Superior,  Wisconsin,  total operating expenses increased $20.7 million,  or 4%,
over 2001. The increase was attributable to additional expenses for nonregulated
generation that came online in 2002 which were partially offset by lower utility
operating  expenses.  Utility operating expenses were down $36.3 million, or 8%,
in 2002 primarily due to lower  purchased  power costs.  Lower  purchased  power
costs resulted from both lower wholesale  prices and a reduction in the quantity
of power purchased.  Extended planned  maintenance  outages in 2001 necessitated
higher  quantities  of  purchased  power  last  year.  Nonregulated/  nonutility
operating expenses  increased $66.5 million,  or 88%, over the prior year mainly
due to  expenses  for  nonregulated  generation  that came  online in 2002.  The
increase in  nonregulated/nonutility  operating  expenses also included the $9.5
million  charge related to the  indefinite  delay of the  generation  project in
Superior, Wisconsin.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES
   OPERATING  REVENUE was up $12.0 million,  or 1%, in 2002. At ADESA  wholesale
auction  facilities  the number of  vehicles  sold in 2002 were  similar to 2001
because  the rental car market  has yet to  re-fleet  up to levels  prior to the
events of  September  11,  2001,  and  manufacturer  incentives  on new vehicles
temporarily, but significantly, disrupted the price spreads between new and used
vehicles.
   Despite unseasonably dry weather conditions in 2002 which usually means fewer
total loss vehicles,  vehicles sold at our total loss vehicle auction facilities
were up 18% reflecting  expansion into new markets,  which included adding total
loss auctions at some of our wholesale  vehicle  auction  facilities.  Operating
revenue  from AFC was higher in 2002 due to a 5% increase  in vehicles  financed
through our loan production offices.
   OPERATING  EXPENSES  were down $21.3  million,  or 3%, in 2002 due to reduced
interest expense ($14.1 million) as a result of lower interest rates and a lower
debt balance,  the discontinuance of goodwill  amortization  ($13.7 million) and
improved  operating  efficiencies.  These decreases were partially  offset by an
increase in operating  expenses  incurred to  standardize  operations at all our
total loss  auction  facilities  and  expenditures  for  information  technology
initiatives.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES
   OPERATING REVENUE was down $42.3 million,  or 57%, in 2002 primarily due to a
large real estate transaction  recorded in 2001. Five large real estate sales in
2002  contributed  $8.5 million to revenue,  while in 2001 six large real estate
sales  contributed  $37.5  million to revenue,  one of which was our real estate
operations'  largest single  transaction  ever.  Operating  revenue in 2002 also
reflected  less  income  from  our  trading   securities   portfolio  which  was
substantially   liquidated   during  the  second   half  of  the  year  and  had
significantly lower returns during the year.
   OPERATING  EXPENSES  were down  $14.7  million,  or 21%,  in 2002  because of
expenses  associated  with  larger  real  estate  sales in 2001.  Also,  in 2001
additional expenses were incurred for incentive compensation.

2001 COMPARED TO 2000

ENERGY SERVICES
   OPERATING  REVENUE in total was up $32.3 million,  or 6%, in 2001  reflecting
increased revenue from nonregulated/  nonutility operations,  as well as a small
increase in utility revenue.  Despite a decrease in utility  megawatthour sales,
utility revenue increased $6.6 million,  or 1%, due to improved wholesale market
conditions  and higher fuel clause  recoveries,  as well as more demand  revenue
from Large Power Customers.  Total utility  megawatthour sales decreased 7% from
the prior  year  mainly due to  planned  shutdowns  and  reduced  production  by
taconite customers.  In addition,  utility revenue in 2001 included the recovery
of $4.5  million  for  1998 CIP lost  margins.  Nonregulated/nonutility  revenue
increased  $25.7 million,  or 47%, in 2001  primarily due to the  acquisition of
Enventis, Inc. which was acquired in July 2001 and accounted for as a pooling of
interests.
   OPERATING  EXPENSES in total increased  $21.5 million,  or 4%, in 2001 mainly
due  to  additional  nonregulated/nonutility  expenses.  Nonregulated/nonutility
operating expenses  increased $22.9 million,  or 43%, over 2000 primarily due to
the inclusion of Enventis, Inc.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES
   Both operating  revenue and expenses for Automotive  Services were up in 2001
due to significant  acquisitions made in 2000 and early 2001.  Financial results
for 2001  included 12 full months of  operations  from 28 wholesale and 10 total
loss vehicle auction facilities acquired or opened primarily in the

second half of 2000 and results from acquisitions made in January and May 2001.
   OPERATING  REVENUE was up $309.5  million,  or 59%, in 2001  reflecting a 37%
increase in vehicles sold at ADESA wholesale auction  facilities,  the inclusion
of revenue related to total loss vehicle services and a 14% increase in vehicles
financed at AFC's loan production offices.  Sales volumes in 2001, however, were
negatively  impacted by the events of September 11 and the impact of  aggressive
new  vehicle  financing  incentives  offered  by  vehicle  manufacturers.  Also,
inclement  weather  earlier in the year  resulted in both low  attendance at and
canceled auctions.
   OPERATING  EXPENSES  were  up  $274.5  million,  or 63%,  in 2001  reflecting
additional  expenses  associated  with  increased  vehicle  sales and  financing
activity.  Expenses in 2001  included  increased  direct costs  associated  with
processing  vehicles  multiple  times that did not sell as a result of depressed
wholesale  prices  resulting  from the events of September 11 and aggressive new
vehicle  financing  incentives  offered  by  vehicle  manufacturers.   Operating
expenses in 2001 also included  integration  costs,  additional  amortization of
goodwill,  additional  interest  expense  related to debt issued in late 2000 to
finance acquisitions,  higher utility expense and more labor costs incurred as a
result of inclement weather in early 2001.

INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES
   OPERATING  REVENUE  was down $2.6  million,  or 3%, in 2001  reflecting  less
revenue from our trading securities portfolio,  partially due to a lower average
balance for most of the year.  The  decrease in revenue was also  attributed  to
$4.9 million less from our emerging technology  investments as a result of fewer
sales of  these  investments  in 2001.  Our  real  estate  operations,  however,
reported stronger sales in 2001, including its largest sale ever. Six large real
estate sales in 2001 contributed  $37.5 million to revenue,  while in 2000 seven
large real estate sales contributed $31.9 million to revenue.
   OPERATING  EXPENSES  in 2001  were up $6.0  million,  or 9%,  as a result  of
increased interest expense and additional  expenses for incentive  compensation.
These increases were tempered by lower expenses at our real estate operations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Certain   accounting   measurements   under  applicable   generally  accepted
accounting principles involve management's judgment about subjective factors and
estimates,  the  effects  of  which  are  inherently  uncertain.  The  following
summarizes  those  accounting  measurements  we believe are most critical to our
reported results of operations and financial condition.

   The allowance for doubtful accounts and related bad debt expense is primarily
attributable  to the  financing  activities  of AFC.  In  establishing  a proper
allowance for doubtful  accounts,  AFC's  evaluation  includes  consideration of
historical  charge-off  experience and current economic  conditions.  Changes to
historical   charge-off   experience  or  existing  economic   conditions  would
necessitate a  corresponding  increase or decrease in the allowance for doubtful
accounts.  The credit quality of AFC's finance receivable portfolio has remained
strong and the total  amount of the  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  has not
changed  materially  over the last three years.  A 10% increase in AFC's current
allowance for doubtful accounts would increase bad debt expense by approximately
$1 million  after tax;  likewise,  a 10% decrease in the current  allowance  for
doubtful accounts would decrease expense by aproximately $1 million after tax.
   An  important  actuarial  assumption  for  pension  and other  postretirement
benefit  plans is the  expected  long-term  rate of  return on plan  assets.  In
establishing this assumption,  we consider the allocation and diversification of
our plan assets,  current  economic  conditions,  actual  historical  investment
performance,  the  historical  performance  of  equity  and debt  securities  in
general,  and our  performance  versus  similar  sized plans.  Our pension asset
allocation is  approximately  70% equity and 30% fixed-rate  securities.  Equity
securities  consist  of a mix of market  capitalization  sizes and also  include
investments in real estate and venture  capital.  In response to changing market
conditions,  we have lowered our actuarial assumption for the expected long-term
rate of return and used

9.5% in the  September  30, 2002 pension  actuarial  study (10% at September 30,
2001;  10.25% at September 30, 2000). We annually review our expected  long-term
rate of return  assumption,  and will  continue  to adjust it to  respond to any
changing  market  conditions.  A 1% decrease in the expected  long-term  rate of
return would  increase the annual  expense for pension and other  postretirement
benefits by approximately $2 million after tax;  likewise,  a 1% increase in the
expected  long-term rate of return would decrease  expense by  approximately  $2
million after tax.

OUTLOOK

   CORPORATE.  Our operations in 42 states,  nine Canadian  provinces and Mexico
employ approximately  14,000 employees.  Since 1980 our annual total shareholder
return  averaged  16%.  Approximately  50% of this  average  was  attributed  to
dividends.  By comparison,  the Standard & Poor's 500 Index averaged 12% for the
same  period,  of which  approximately  25% of the  average  was  attributed  to
dividends.
   We remain focused on  continuously  improving the performance of our two core
businesses, Energy and Automotive Services, and monetizing those businesses that
are  non-strategic  or non-core.  Our two core businesses  remain strong and are
poised for earnings growth in their  respective  markets as economic  conditions
improve.
   Once we have sold our Water  Services  businesses in Florida,  North Carolina
and Georgia,  we will have further  simplified our Company.  The pending sale of
Florida  Water for $492.5  million has been  delayed by legal  challenges.  Cash
proceeds to ALLETE after taxes and repayment of existing debt are expected to be
approximately $180 million in 2003, and $250 million for the entire transaction.
The gain on the transaction is estimated at $100 million after taxes and related
costs.  While the majority of the cash will be received at closing,  the gain is
expected to be recognized in future years as required by accounting  rules.  The
proceeds  from the sale will give us the  ability  to reduce  debt,  which  will
further  strengthen our balance sheet. We anticipate  selling our Water Services
businesses in North Carolina and Georgia in 2003. (See Item 1.)
   Our Board of Directors and management remain committed to unlocking the value
of ALLETE. In 2002 we undertook an examination of the benefits of separating our
Energy and Automotive businesses into separate companies.  At that time we chose
not to separate because all of the businesses of our Company  benefited from the
cash  flow  and  credit  position  of the  consolidated  company.  We are  again
reviewing this issue both internally and with outside advisors.
   ENERGY SERVICES  continues to generate strong cash flow from  operations.  We
anticipate,  however,  net  income for 2003 from  Energy  Services  to  decrease
slightly from 2002 levels.  If wholesale power prices  improve,  so too will our
profitability  from Energy Services.  To combat  continuing  depressed prices in
wholesale energy markets, minimal growth in our service area and uncertain state
and national economies,  we will focus on cost reductions while seeking new ways
to maintain or enhance revenue.
   Our access to and ownership of low-cost power are Energy  Services'  greatest
strengths.  We have adequate generation to serve our native load. Power over and
above our customers'  requirements is and will continue to be marketed primarily
through Split Rock Energy.
   Over one-half of Minnesota  Power's  utility power sales are made to taconite
mines, paper producers and oil pipeline  operators.  Minnesota Power's paper and
taconite customers supply industries that are undergoing  significant structural
change in the face of continued  globalization and  consolidation.  For taconite
producers,  the ongoing  consolidation of the domestic integrated steel industry
has  both  positive  and  negative  implications.   As  steel  companies  divest
themselves  of raw  material  operations  and  address  decades  of legacy  cost
accumulation,  they will use  acquisitions  to  position  themselves  for future
successes  in  a  worldwide  steel  market  that  rewards  low-cost,   efficient
producers.
   Unfortunately,  the process of rationalizing  steel  production  capacity may
lead to a reduction  in the number of iron ore mines  required to supply  United
States and Canadian  blast  furnaces.  The near term impacts of a taconite plant
closure would be significant for Minnesota Power and northeastern  Minnesota. In
the long term,  however,  improving  the cost  competitiveness  of the  domestic
integrated  steelmakers  is critical to  assuring a stable  production  base for
Minnesota iron ore once steel import tariff  protections are lifted.  The annual
taconite production in Minnesota was 39 million tons in 2002 (33 million tons in
2001; 47 million tons in 2000).  Based on our research of the taconite industry,
Minnesota  taconite  production  for 2003 is  anticipated to be about 37 million
tons. As a result of continuing  consolidation  in the integrated steel business
and its resulting  impact on taconite  producers,  Minnesota  Power is unable to
predict  taconite  production  levels for the next two to five years.  Minnesota
Power  believes it is  positioned  to mitigate the impacts of reduced  load,  if
necessary,  by selling any excess  low-cost  generation in the  wholesale  power
marketplace.
   The paper manufacturing  business is also weathering  significant  structural
change as  international  consolidation  continues and North American  producers
aggressively  cut costs and look for an end to the  current  down cycle in paper
pricing.  Three  of  Minnesota  Power's  four  major  pulp and  paper  producing
customers  are  now  owned  by  international  firms.  As  these  firms  seek to
rationalize world production capacity with demand, they are removing older paper
machines from their asset  portfolios  and focusing on improving  efficiency and
cost  competitiveness  at their newer and larger  machines.  Actions by Potlatch
Corporation and UPM-Kymmene  Corporation (the owner of Blandin Paper Company) to
stop producing paper from their oldest and

smallest  machines  in 2002 and 2003  reflect  this trend.  We believe  that the
papermaking  assets that remain in our service  area have the ability to be cost
competitive  in the  region or global  markets  they  serve.  Minnesota  Power's
ongoing  focus has been and will  continue to be on  providing  energy at prices
that enable these mills to maintain or improve their competitive positions.
   Nonregulated generation operations, which began in 2002 at Taconite Harbor in
northern Minnesota and generation  obtained through a 15-year agreement with NRG
Energy at the Kendall  County  facility near  Chicago,  Illinois,  help position
Minnesota Power to generate more electricity,  move it more readily, manage more
transactions with less risk and benefit system reliability.
   Plans to construct a 220-mile,  345-kV Duluth-to-Wausau electric transmission
line proposed by Minnesota Power,  American  Transmission  Company and Wisconsin
Public Service Corporation continue to be developed.  The new line addresses the
pressing  need  for more  dependable  electricity  in  Wisconsin  and the  Upper
Midwest. (See Item 1. - Energy Services - Regulatory Issues.)
   Our telecommunications  business,  Enventis Telecom, grew its revenue in 2002
by  approximately  19%  despite  the  challenging  economy  and drop in  overall
information  technology  spending.  Enventis  Telecom is well  recognized in the
Upper Midwest as one of the leading  integrated data services providers offering
a mix  of  transport,  complex  network  integration,  and  related  application
development  services.  Our  plan  is to  continue  to  leverage  our  excellent
reputation and key industry partners to further our success in the marketplace.
   AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES continues to be our largest contributor to net income. We
anticipate  earnings from Automotive  Services to increase by about 15% in 2003.
While we believe that the volume of used  vehicles  sold within the auto auction
industry  will  rise  at a rate  of 2%  compounded  annually  through  2007,  we
anticipate vehicles sold through our wholesale and total loss auction facilities
combined will increase by 4% to 7% in 2003,  and vehicles  financed  through AFC
will increase by about 11% in 2003.  Automotive  Services  continues to focus on
growth  in the  volume  of  vehicles  sold  and  financed,  increased  ancillary
services, and operating and technological efficiencies.  Selective fee increases
will also be considered.
   By offering an  expanding  circle of  customers  new levels of service in the
vehicle remarketing industry, Automotive Services expects to expand its presence
in the North  American auto  industry.  In 2002 we opened ADESA Golden Gate, the
largest vehicle auction facility in California, and ADESA Vancouver in Richmond,
British  Columbia.  Both were built to replace  aging  facilities  that were too
small to efficiently  serve our growing customer demand.  New wholesale  auction
facilities in Long Island, New York; Atlanta,  Georgia;  and Edmonton,  Alberta,
are also under construction and slated to open in 2003. The new facility in Long
Island is a greenfield (a newly constructed facility in a new market), while the
new  facilities  in Atlanta and  Edmonton  will  replace  aging  facilities.  In
addition  to  internally  growing our  existing  auctions  and dealer  floorplan
financing business, we will continue to consider accretive  acquisitions in both
the wholesale and total loss vehicle auction  businesses.  We will also consider
greenfield  sites as  appropriate  and the  integration  of total  loss  vehicle
services at certain  wholesale  vehicle auction  facilities.  We believe further
consolidation  of the total loss  vehicle  auction  industry  will occur and are
evaluating various means by which we can continue our growth plan.
   ADESA's  leadership  expects to adapt to  changing  used  vehicle  markets by
better serving used vehicle  dealers,  who are the bread and butter of wholesale
vehicle auctions and the backbone of AFC's customer base. The number of vehicles
coming off lease is expected to slow down in mid-2003,  which will place an even
higher premium on catering to individual dealers seeking to replenish  inventory
at auctions.
   The  vehicle  remarketing  industry  has been  challenged  by the  events  of
September  11,  2001,  by a  softening  economy  and by lower  wholesale  prices
resulting from high used vehicle  inventories and zero-percent  financing on new
vehicles.  The  rental  car market  has yet to  re-fleet  up to levels  prior to
September  11, and  manufacturer  incentives  on new vehicles  temporarily,  but
significantly,  disrupted  the  price  spreads  between  new and used  vehicles.
Aggressive  financing  incentives offered by vehicle  manufacturers  lowered the
cost of owning a new vehicle,  which, in turn,  depressed  prices for late-model
used vehicles.  This reduced the number of vehicles sold at auctions because car
dealers  restocked  their  inventories  from the increased  volume of late-model
vehicles traded in for new vehicles, and sellers at auction tended to hold their
vehicles rather than immediately accept the lower prices.
   If the economy improves,  retail demand should improve as well, and this will
allow a welcome  resumption  of the used vehicle  sales growth we saw earlier in
2002.
   INVESTMENTS  AND CORPORATE  CHARGES.  We anticipate  net income from our real
estate operations to remain stable in 2003, while corporate charges are expected
to  reflect  less  unallocated  interest  expense  as a  result  of  lower  debt
obligations.
   Revenue from property sales by real estate  operations  continues to be three
to four times more than the  acquisition  cost,  creating strong cash generation
and  profitability.  Our real estate operations may, from time to time,  acquire
packages of diversified  properties at low cost, add value through  entitlements
and  infrastructure  enhancements,  and sell the  properties  at current  market
prices.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES
   A primary goal of our strategic plan is to improve cash flow from operations.
Our strategy  includes  growing the  businesses  both  internally  with expanded
facilities,  services and operations (see Capital Requirements),  and externally
through acquisitions.
   During 2002 strong cash flow from operating  activities  reflected  operating
results  and  continued  focus on  working  capital  management.  Cash flow from
operating  activities was higher in 2002 due to the  substantial  liquidation of
the trading  securities  portfolio  and the timing of the  collection of certain
finance  receivables  outstanding at December 31, 2001. Also, in 2001 additional
trading  securities  were purchased with a portion of the proceeds from a common
stock  issuance.  Cash flow from  operations  was also  affected  by a number of
factors representative of normal operations.
   WORKING  CAPITAL.  At December 31, 2002 working  capital needs  included $275
million of long-term debt due in 2003.  Additional working capital,  if and when
needed,  generally is provided by the sale of commercial  paper.  During 2002 we
liquidated our trading securities  portfolio and used the proceeds to reduce our
short-term debt.  Approximately  4.6 million original issue shares of our common
stock are  available  for  issuance  through  INVEST  DIRECT,  our direct  stock
purchase  and dividend  reinvestment  plan.  ALLETE's  $175 million bank line of
credit provides credit support for our commercial paper program.  The amount and
timing of future sales of our securities will depend upon market  conditions and
our specific  needs.  We may sell  securities to meet capital  requirements,  to
provide for the retirement or early  redemption of issues of long-term  debt, to
reduce short-term debt and for other corporate purposes.
   A substantial amount of ADESA's working capital is generated  internally from
payments for services provided. ADESA, however, has arrangements to use proceeds
from the sale of commercial  paper issued by ALLETE to meet  short-term  working
capital  requirements  arising from the timing of payment obligations to vehicle
sellers and the availability of funds from vehicle purchasers.  During the sales
process, ADESA does not typically take title to vehicles.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
   In July 2001 ADESA  entered into a lease  agreement for the ADESA Golden Gate
facility in Tracy, California, which was completed in the third quarter of 2002.
The term of the lease is through July 2006 with no renewal options.  The cost to
the lessor of the facility was approximately  $45 million.  ADESA has guaranteed
up to $38 million of any deficiency in sales  proceeds that the lessor  realizes
in disposing of the leased  property.  ADESA will receive any sales  proceeds in
excess of cost.
   ADESA has  guaranteed the payment of principal and interest up to $38 million
on the lessor's indebtedness. Terms of the mortgage notes payable require, among
other things,  that ADESA maintain certain minimum  financial  ratios. It is not
practical to estimate the fair value of the guarantee;  however,  ADESA does not
anticipate  that it will  incur  losses as a result of this  guarantee.  We have
guaranteed ADESA's obligation under this lease.
   In April 2000 leases for three ADESA auction  facilities  (Boston,  Charlotte
and Knoxville)  were  refinanced in a $28.4 million lease  transaction.  The new
lease is treated as an  operating  lease for  financial  reporting  purposes and
expires in April 2010 with no renewal  options.  ADESA has  guaranteed up to $23
million  of any  deficiency  in sales  proceeds  that  the  lessor  realizes  in
disposing  of the leased  properties.  ADESA is  entitled  to receive  any sales
proceeds in excess of $29.3 million.
   ADESA has  guaranteed the payment of principal and interest up to $23 million
on the lessor's  indebtedness,  which  consists of $28.4 million  mortgage notes
payable,  due April 1, 2020. Terms of the mortgage notes payable require,  among
other things, that ADESA maintain certain minimum financial ratios.  Interest on
the notes  varies and is payable  monthly.  It is not  practical to estimate the
fair value of the guarantee;  however,  ADESA does not  anticipate  that it will
incur  losses  as a  result  of  this  guarantee.  We  have  guaranteed  ADESA's
obligations under this lease.
   AFC offers  short-term  on-site  financing  for dealers to purchase  vehicles
mostly at auctions  in exchange  for a security  interest in each  vehicle.  The
financing  is  provided  through  the  earlier of the date the dealer  sells the
vehicle or a general  borrowing term of 30 to 45 days. AFC has  arrangements  to
use  proceeds  from the sale of  commercial  paper  issued by ALLETE to meet its
short-term working capital requirements.
   AFC,  through a wholly owned  subsidiary,  sells certain finance  receivables
through a revolving private  securitization  structure.  In May 2002 AFC and its
subsidiary entered into a revised  securitization  agreement that allows for the
revolving  sale by the  subsidiary  to third  parties  of up to $500  million in
undivided  interests  in eligible  finance  receivables.  The revised  agreement
expires in 2005.  The  securitization  agreement  in place prior to May 31, 2002
limited the sale of undivided interests to $325 million. In accordance with SFAS
140,   "Accounting   for  Transfers  and  Servicing  of  Financial   Assets  and
Extinguishments  of Liabilities,"  which became applicable to AFC upon amendment
of  the  securitization   agreement,   AFC,  for  accounting   purposes,   began
consolidating  the subsidiary  used in the  securitization  structure on June 1,
2002.  Previously,  AFC's interest in this  subsidiary was recorded by ALLETE as
residual  interest in other  current  assets ($103 million at December 31, 2001)
net of the subsidiary's allowance for doubtful accounts. The residual interest

previously  reflected  in prior  periods  has been  reclassified  by  ALLETE  to
accounts receivable to conform to current year presentations.
   AFC managed total  receivables of $495.1 million at December 31, 2002 ($500.2
million at December 31, 2001);  $191.3 million represent  receivables which were
included  in accounts  receivable  on our  consolidated  balance  sheet  ($233.2
million at December 31, 2001) and $303.8 million  represent  receivables sold in
undivided  interests  through the  securitization  agreement  ($267.0 million at
December 31, 2001) which are off-balance  sheet. AFC's proceeds from the sale of
the  receivables to third parties were used to repay  borrowings from ALLETE and
fund new loans to AFC's  customers.  AFC and the  subsidiary  must each maintain
certain  financial  covenants such as minimum  tangible net worth to comply with
the terms of the securitization agreement. AFC has historically performed better
than the covenant thresholds set forth in the securitization  agreement.  We are
not  currently  aware  of any  changing  circumstances  that  would  put  AFC in
noncompliance with the covenants.

SECURITIES
   In March 2001 ALLETE, ALLETE Capital II and ALLETE Capital III, jointly filed
a registration  statement with the SEC pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities
Act of 1933. The registration  statement,  which has been declared  effective by
the SEC,  relates to the possible  issuance of a remaining  aggregate  amount of
$387 million of securities which may include ALLETE common stock, first mortgage
bonds and other debt  securities,  and ALLETE  Capital II and ALLETE Capital III
preferred  trust  securities.   ALLETE  also  previously  filed  a  registration
statement,  which  has  been  declared  effective  by the SEC,  relating  to the
possible  issuance  of $25  million  of first  mortgage  bonds  and  other  debt
securities.  We may sell all or a portion of the remaining registered securities
if warranted by market  conditions and our capital  requirements.  Any offer and
sale  of the  above  mentioned  securities  will  be made  only  by  means  of a
prospectus  meeting the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules
and regulations thereunder.

INVESTMENTS
   As investments in emerging technology companies are sold, we recognize a gain
or loss. Our direct investment in the companies that have gone public,  which we
account for as available-for-sale  securities, had a cost basis of approximately
$10  million at  December  31,  2002 ($7  million at  December  31,  2001).  The
aggregate market value of our investment in these companies at December 31, 2002
was $6 million  ($12 million at December  31,  2001).  We believe the decline in
market value that has occurred since second  quarter 2002 is temporary.  We have
the  ability  and intent to hold these  investments  until the market  recovers.
These investments provide us with access to developing technologies before their
commercial  debut,  as well  as  potential  financial  returns.  We  view  these
investments as a source of capital for redeployment in existing businesses.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS
   Our long-term debt obligations, including long-term debt due within one year,
represent the principal  amount of bonds,  notes and loans which are recorded on
our consolidated balance sheet.
   Quarterly  Income Preferred  Securities  represent all of the preferred trust
securities  issued by ALLETE  Capital I, a wholly owned  statutory  trust of the
Company. ALLETE owns all of the common trust securities issued by ALLETE Capital
I. (See Note 14.)
   Unconditional  purchase  obligations  represent  our Square Butte and Kendall
County power purchase  agreements,  and minimum purchase  commitments under coal
and rail contracts.
   Under our power  purchase  agreement  with Square Butte that extends  through
2026, we are  obligated to pay our pro rata share of Square  Butte's costs based
on our entitlement to the output of Square Butte's 455 MW coal-fired  generating
unit near Center,  North Dakota.  Our payment  obligation is suspended if Square
Butte fails to deliver any power, whether produced or purchased, for a period of
one year.  Square  Butte's  fixed costs consist  primarily of debt service.  The
table  above  reflects  our share of future  debt  service  based on our current
output  entitlement  of 71%.  After 2005 Minnkota Power has the option to reduce
our entitlement by 5% annually, to a minimum of 50%. (See Note 13.)
   Under the Kendall County  agreement,  we pay a fixed capacity  charge for the
right,  but not the  obligation,  to  utilize  one 275 MW  generating  unit near
Chicago,  Illinois. We are responsible for arranging the natural gas fuel supply
and are entitled to the electricity produced. (See Note 13.)

   SPLIT ROCK ENERGY.  We provide up to $50.0 million in credit support,  in the
form of letters of credit and  financial  guarantees,  to  facilitate  the power
marketing  activities  of Split Rock Energy.  At December 31, 2002 $10.5 million
was used to support actual  obligations ($3.4 million at December 31, 2001). The
credit support generally expires within one year from the date of issuance.
   EMERGING TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS. We have investments in emerging technologies
through the  minority  ownership  of  preferred  stock,  common stock and equity
interests  in  limited  liability   companies.   The  investments  are  in  both
privately-held and publicly-held  entities. We have committed to make additional
investments in certain emerging technology holdings. The total future commitment
was $7.7 million at December 31, 2002 ($11.0  million at December 31, 2001).  We
expect approximately $1 million of the future commitment to be invested in 2003,
with the balance to be invested at various times through 2007.

CREDIT RATINGS
   Our  securities  have been rated by  Standard & Poor's  Ratings  Services,  a
division of The McGraw-Hill  Companies,  Inc. (Standard & Poor's) and by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's).  On January 27, 2003 Standard & Poor's placed
our BBB+ corporate credit rating on CREDITWATCH  DEVELOPING following our public
acknowledgement  that we are  considering a major corporate  restructuring  that
could  ultimately  result in a  separation  of our two core  businesses.  We are
unable to predict if such a separation  would have a  significant  effect on our
credit quality.

   Rating agencies use both quantitative and qualitative measures in determining
a company's credit rating. These measures include business risk, liquidity risk,
competitive position,  capital mix, financial condition,  predictability of cash
flows,  management  strength  and  future  direction.  Some of the  quantitative
measures  can  be  analyzed  through  a few  key  financial  ratios,  while  the
qualitative ones are more subjective.  The disclosure of these credit ratings is
not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our securities. Ratings are subject to
revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning  rating  organization.  Each
rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

PAYOUT RATIO
   In 2002 we paid out 66% (59% in 2001;  51% in 2000) of our per share earnings
in dividends. Excluding the gain related to the ACE transaction, in 2000 we paid
out 64% of our per share earnings in dividends.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

   Consolidated  capital  expenditures  totaled  $205.8  million in 2002 ($153.0
million in 2001;  $168.7 million in 2000).  Expenditures for 2002 included $80.9
million for Energy  Services,  $71.1  million for  Automotive  Services and $5.7
million  for  Investments  and  Corporate  Charges.  Expenditures  for 2002 also
included  $48.1 million  related to  Discontinued  Operations  ($44.2 million to
maintain our Water  Services  businesses  while they are in the process of being
sold; $3.9 million to buy previously leased auto transport  trucks).  Internally
generated funds were the primary source of funding for these expenditures.
   Capital  expenditures are expected to be $134 million in 2003 and total about
$400 million for 2004 through 2007. Capital  expenditures through 2007 are lower
than in the past because we anticipate no new major  construction of facilities.
The 2003 amount  includes  $74 million for Energy  Services  and $55 million for
Automotive  Services.  Energy  Services'  expenditures  are for system component
replacement and upgrades,  telecommunication  fiber and coal handling equipment.
Automotive   Services'   expenditures  are  for  new  auctions  currently  under
construction,  expansions and on-going  improvements at existing vehicle auction
facilities and  associated  computer  systems.  The 2003 amount also includes $5
million to maintain our Water Services  businesses  until they are sold in 2003.
We expect to finance a $33 million  investment  in new coal  handling  equipment
with an existing long-term line of credit and use internally  generated funds to
fund all other capital expenditures.

MARKET RISK

SECURITIES INVESTMENTS
   Our securities  investments include certain securities held for an indefinite
period of time which are  accounted  for as  available-for-sale  securities  and
recorded at fair value. At December 31, 2002 our  available-for-sale  securities
portfolio consisted of minority interests in the common stock of publicly-traded
corporations  held in our Emerging  Technology  portfolio,  and  securities in a
grantor   trust   established   to   fund   certain   employee   benefits.   Our
available-for-sale  securities  portfolio  had a fair value of $20.9  million at
December 31, 2002 ($26.5 million at December 31, 2001).
   As part of our Emerging Technology  portfolio,  we also have several minority
investments  in venture  capital funds and  privately-held  start-up  companies.
These  investments  are  accounted  for under the cost method and included  with
Investments on our consolidated balance sheet. The total carrying value of these
investments was $38.7 million at

December  31,  2002  ($40.6  million at  December  31,  2001).  Our policy is to
periodically  review these  investments for impairment by assessing such factors
as  continued  commercial  viability of products,  cash flow and  earnings.  Any
impairment would reduce the carrying value of the investment.

INTEREST RATE SWAP
   In October  2001 we  entered  into an  interest  rate swap  agreement  with a
notional  amount of $250  million to hedge $250  million of  floating  rate debt
issued in  October  2000.  Under the  15-month  swap  agreement,  we made  fixed
quarterly  payments  based on a fixed rate of 3.2% and  received  payments  at a
floating  rate based on LIBOR (1.8% at December 31,  2002).  The swap expired in
January  2003 and the  Company  did not enter  into any new  interest  rate swap
agreements.

FOREIGN CURRENCY
   Our foreign  currency  exposure  is limited to the  conversion  of  operating
results of our Canadian and Mexican  subsidiaries.  We have not entered into any
foreign  exchange  contracts to hedge the  conversion of our Canadian or Mexican
operating results into United States dollars.  Mexican operations which began in
2002 were not material.

POWER MARKETING
   Minnesota  Power  purchases  power for retail sales in our  electric  utility
service  territory and sells excess  generation in the wholesale market. We have
about 500 MW of  nonregulated  generation  available  for sale to the  wholesale
market. Our nonregulated  generation  includes about 225 MW from Taconite Harbor
in northern Minnesota that was acquired in October 2001. It also includes 275 MW
of generation obtained through a 15-year agreement, which commenced in May 2002,
with NRG Energy at the Kendall County facility near Chicago, Illinois. Under the
Kendall County agreement,  we pay a fixed capacity charge for the right, but not
the  obligation,  to utilize one 275 MW generating  unit. We are responsible for
arranging  the  natural  gas fuel  supply and are  entitled  to the  electricity
produced.  Our  strategy  is to  sell  a  significant  portion  of  nonregulated
generation through long-term contracts of various durations. The balance will be
sold in the spot market  through  short-term  agreements.  We currently have two
long-term forward capacity and energy contracts  related to generation  obtained
through  the  Kendall  County  agreement.  Each is for 50 MW,  with one having a
10-year term and the other a 15-year term.
   The services of Split Rock Energy are used to fulfill  purchase  requirements
for retail load and to market excess generation. We own 50% of Split Rock Energy
which was formed in 2000 with Great  River  Energy to provide us with least cost
supply, maximize the value of our generation assets and maximize power marketing
revenue within  prescribed  limits.  Split Rock Energy operates in the wholesale
energy markets, and engages in marketing activities by entering into forward and
option  contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity.  These contracts are
primarily  short-term in nature with maturities of less than one year.  Although
Split Rock Energy generally attempts to balance its purchase and sale positions,
commodity  price risk  sometimes  exists or is  created.  This risk is  actively
managed through a risk management program that includes policies, procedures and
limits established by the Split Rock Energy Board of Governors.  Minnesota Power
holds two seats on this four member Board.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

   SFAS  143,  "Accounting  for  Asset  Retirement  Obligations,"  requires  the
recognition of a liability for an asset  retirement  obligation in the period in
which it is incurred.  When the  liability is initially  recorded,  the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset is correspondingly  increased. Over time,
the  liability  is  accreted to its  present  value and the related  capitalized
charge is depreciated  over the useful life of the asset.  SFAS 143 is effective
for fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15,  2002.  Currently,  decommissioning
amounts  collected  in  Minnesota  Power's  rates are  reported  in  accumulated
depreciation, which upon adoption of SFAS 143

by the Company will require a reclassification to a liability.  We are reviewing
what additional assets, if any, may have associated  retirement costs as defined
by SFAS 143 and  anticipate  no material  impact on our  financial  position and
results of operations.
   In  November  2002  the  FASB  issued  Interpretation  No.  45,  "Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness  of Others." The  Interpretation  expands  disclosure
requirements for certain  guarantees and requires the recognition of a liability
for the fair value of an  obligation  assumed  under a guarantee.  The liability
recognition  provisions  apply on a prospective  basis to  guarantees  issued or
modified after December 31, 2002, and the disclosure  provisions apply to fiscal
years  ending after  December  15, 2002.  We do not believe the adoption of this
Interpretation  will have a material impact on our financial position or results
of operations.
   In January  2003 the FASB issued  Interpretation  No. 46,  "Consolidation  of
Variable Interest  Entities." In general, a variable interest entity is one with
equity  investors  that do not have voting  rights or do not provide  sufficient
financial  resources  for the entity to support  its  activities.  Under the new
rules,  variable  interest  entities will be  consolidated  by the party that is
subject to the  majority of the risk of loss or entitled to the  majority of the
residual returns. The new rules are effective  immediately for variable interest
entities  created  after  January 31, 2003 and in the third  quarter of 2003 for
previously existing variable interest entities. We are reviewing certain auction
facility  lease  agreements  entered  into by  ADESA  prior to  January  2003 to
determine (1) if the lessor is a variable interest entity,  and (2) if we should
consolidate  the lessor.  If it is  ultimately  determined  that the lessor is a
variable  interest entity that should be included in our consolidated  financial
statements,  we  estimate  that we will  record  approximately  $73  million  in
property,   plant  and  equipment,  and  $73  million  in  long-term  debt.  Any
recognition of these amounts would first occur in the third quarter of 2003.
   In October 2002 the FASB's  Emerging  Issues Task Force  rescinded EITF Issue
98-10,  "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management
Activities."  The ruling took effect January 1, 2003 for existing  contracts and
immediately for contracts entered into after October 25, 2002. Early adoption is
permitted.  In general,  EITF 98-10  required  energy  trading  contracts  to be
marked-to-market with resulting gains and losses recognized in income. Any gains
or losses  recognized under the provisions of EITF 98-10 through the end of 2002
will be reversed under the transitional  provisions contained in the rescission.
We were required to account for the Kendall  County  agreement  under EITF 98-10
which  resulted in the  recognition  of $4.7 million of  mark-to-market  pre-tax
income in the second quarter of 2002 ($0 in 2001).  We adopted the rescission of
EITF 98-10 in the fourth quarter of 2002 and reversed the mark-to-market  income
recognized earlier in the year. The Kendall County agreement is not a derivative
under SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Investments and Hedging Activities."

To the Shareholders and
Board of Directors of ALLETE, Inc.

   In our opinion,  the accompanying  consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated  statements of income,  of cash flows and of  shareholders'  equity
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ALLETE, Inc.
and its  subsidiaries  at December  31, 2002 and 2001,  and the results of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in  the  United  States  of  America.   These   financial   statements  are  the
responsibility of ALLETE, Inc.'s management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  based on our audits.  We conducted  our
audits of these  statements in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United  States of America which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence  supporting the amounts and  disclosures  in the financial  statements,
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  and evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We
believe  that our audits  provide a reasonable  basis for the opinion  expressed
above.
   As discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated  financial statements,  the
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards,  No. 142, "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002.

MANAGEMENT

   The consolidated  financial  statements and other financial  information were
prepared by management,  who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.
The  financial  statements  have been  prepared  in  conformity  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles and  necessarily  include some amounts that are
based on informed judgments and best estimates and assumptions of management.
   To meet management's  responsibilities with respect to financial information,
we maintain  and enforce a system of internal  accounting  controls  designed to
provide assurance,  on a cost effective basis, that transactions are carried out
in accordance with management's  authorizations  and that assets are safeguarded
against  loss from  unauthorized  use or  disposition.  The system  includes  an
organizational   structure   that  provides  an   appropriate   segregation   of
responsibilities,  careful selection and training of personnel, written policies
and  procedures,  and periodic  reviews by our  internal  audit  department.  In
addition,  we have  personnel  policies that require all employees to maintain a
high standard of ethical  conduct.  Management  believes the system is effective
and provides  reasonable  assurance that all transactions are properly  recorded
and have been executed in accordance with management's authorization. Management
modifies and improves our system of internal  accounting controls in response to
changes in business  conditions.  Our  internal  audit staff is charged with the
responsibility for determining compliance with our procedures.
   Four  of our  directors,  not  members  of  management,  serve  as the  Audit
Committee.  Our  Board of  Directors,  through  the  Audit  Committee,  oversees
management's responsibilities for financial reporting. The Audit Committee meets
regularly with management, the internal auditors and the independent accountants
to discuss  auditing and  financial  matters and to assure that each is carrying
out  their   responsibilities.   The  internal   auditors  and  the  independent
accountants have full and free access to the Audit Committee without  management
present.  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP, independent  accountants,  are engaged to
express an opinion on the  financial  statements.  Their audit is  conducted  in
accordance with generally  accepted auditing  standards and includes a review of
internal  controls and tests of  transactions  to the extent  necessary to allow
them to report on the fairness of our operating results and financial condition.

2  OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREPARATION.  References in this report to "we" and "our"
are to ALLETE  and its  subsidiaries,  collectively.  We prepare  our  financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted  accounting  principles.  These
principles  require  management to make informed  judgments,  best estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and
expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
   PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION.  Our consolidated  financial  statements include
the accounts of ALLETE and all of our majority owned subsidiary  companies.  All
material   intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated  in
consolidation.  Information  for prior periods has been  reclassified to present
comparable information for all periods.
   BUSINESS  SEGMENTS.  Energy  Services and Automotive  Services  segments were
determined based on products and services provided. The Investment and Corporate
Charges segment was determined based on short-term corporate liquidity needs and
the need to provide financial flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives in the
other  business  segments.  We measure  performance  of our  operations  through
careful  budgeting and monitoring of contributions to consolidated net income by
each business segment. Discontinued operations included operating results of our
Water Services businesses, our auto transport business and our retail store.
   ENERGY SERVICES.  Through  Minnesota Power, an operating  division of ALLETE,
Energy Services is engaged in the  generation,  transmission,  distribution  and
marketing of electricity.  In addition,  nonregulated/nonutility  operations are
conducted through BNI Coal,  Enventis Telecom and Rainy River Energy, all wholly
owned subsidiaries.
   Utility   electric  service  is  provided  to  147,000  retail  customers  in
northeastern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin.  Approximately 50% of utility
electric  sales are to large power  customers  (which  consists of five taconite
producers,   five  paper  and  pulp  mills,  two  pipeline   companies  and  one
manufacturer) under  all-requirements  contracts with expiration dates extending
from September 2004 through December 2008.  Utility electric rates are under the
jurisdiction of various state and federal regulatory  authorities.  Billings are
rendered  on a cycle  basis.  Revenue is accrued for  service  provided  but not
billed.  Utility electric rates include  adjustment  clauses that bill or credit
customers for fuel and purchased  energy costs above or below the base levels in
rate  schedules  and  that  bill  retail  customers  for  the  recovery  of  CIP
expenditures not collected in base rates.
   Minnesota Power, along with Rainy River Energy,  also engages in nonregulated
electric  generation and power  marketing.  Nonregulated  generation is non-rate
base generation sold at market-based rates to the wholesale market.
   Split Rock  Energy is a joint  venture  of  Minnesota  Power and Great  River
Energy which combines the two companies' power supply  capabilities and customer
loads for power pool operations and generation outage protection. We account for
our 50%  ownership  interest  in Split Rock  Energy  under the equity  method of
accounting.  For the year ended  December 31, 2002 our equity  income from Split
Rock Energy was $7.3  million  ($3.6  million in 2001;  $0 million in 2000).  We
received $2.6 million in cash distributions from Split Rock Energy in 2002 ($2.1
million in 2001; $0 million in 2000).  We purchase  power from Split Rock Energy
to serve  native load  requirements  and sell  generation  to Split Rock Energy.
Purchases and sales are at market rates.  In 2002 we made power  purchases  from
Split Rock Energy of $34.3  million  ($56.1  million in 2001;  $25.1  million in
2000) and power sales to Split Rock Energy of $14.5  million  ($13.3  million in
2001; $11.7 million in 2000).
   BNI  Coal  mines  and  sells  lignite  coal to two  North  Dakota  mine-mouth
generating  units,  one  of  which  is  Square  Butte.   Square  Butte  supplies
approximately  71% (323 MW) of its output to  Minnesota  Power under a long-term
contract. (See Note 13.)
   Enventis  Telecom is our  telecommunications  business which is an integrated
data services  provider  offering fiber  optic-based  communication and advanced
data  services  to  businesses  and  communities  in  Minnesota,  Wisconsin  and
Missouri.
   AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES.   Automotive  Services  include  several  wholly  owned
subsidiaries operating as integral parts of the vehicle redistribution business.
   ADESA is the  second  largest  wholesale  vehicle  auction  network  in North
America. ADESA owns or leases, and operates 52 wholesale vehicle auctions in the
United States and Canada  through which used cars and other vehicles are sold to
franchised automobile dealers and licensed used car dealers.  Sellers at ADESA's
auctions  include  domestic  and  foreign  auto   manufacturers,   car  dealers,
automotive fleet/lease companies,  banks and finance companies. ADESA Impact has
25 auction  facilities  in the United  States and Canada that provide total loss
vehicle  services to insurance,  vehicle  leasing and rental car companies.  AFC
provides  inventory  financing for wholesale and retail  automobile  dealers who
purchase vehicles at auctions. AFC has 81 loan production offices located across
the United States and Canada.  These offices provide qualified dealers credit to
purchase  vehicles at any of the 500 plus  auctions  and other  outside  sources
approved by AFC. PAR provides customized vehicle remarketing services, including
nationwide  repossessions and the liquidation of off-lease vehicles,  to various
businesses with fleet operations.  AutoVIN provides  technology-enabled  vehicle
inspection  services and inventory auditing to the automotive  industry.  ADESA,

of  receivables,  and  interest,  fee and servicer  income.  As is customary for
finance  companies,  AFC's  revenue is reported net of interest  expense of $1.3
million in 2002 ($3.4  million in 2001;  $2.7  million in 2000).  AFC  generally
sells its United States dollar denominated finance receivables through a private
securitization  structure.   Gains  and  losses  on  such  sales  are  generally
recognized at the time of settlement  based on the difference  between the sales
proceeds and the allocated basis of the finance  receivables sold,  adjusted for
transaction fees. AFC also retains the right to service receivables sold through
securitization and receives a fee for doing so.
   INVESTMENTS AND CORPORATE CHARGES.  Investments and Corporate Charges include
real estate  operations,  investments  in emerging  technologies  related to the
electric utility industry and general corporate  expenses,  including  interest,
not specifically related to any one business segment. Our real estate operations
include several wholly owned  subsidiaries  and an 80% ownership in Lehigh.  All
are Florida  companies,  which  through their  subsidiaries,  own real estate in
Florida.  Real estate revenue is recognized on the accrual basis.  Also included
in Investments and Corporate Charges was our trading securities  portfolio which
was liquidated during the second half of 2002.
   DEPRECIATION. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at original cost and
are reported on the balance sheet net of accumulated depreciation.  Expenditures
for additions and significant  replacements  and  improvements  are capitalized;
maintenance  and repair costs are expensed as incurred.  Expenditures  for major
plant  overhauls are also accounted for using this same policy.  When nonutility
property,  plant and  equipment  are retired or otherwise  disposed of, gains or
losses are recognized in revenue. When utility property, plant and equipment are
retired or otherwise disposed of, no gain or loss is recognized.
   Depreciation  is computed  using the  estimated  useful  lives of the various
classes  of  plant.  In 2002  average  depreciation  rates  for the  energy  and
automotive services segments were 3.1% and 4.3% (3.0% and 4.0% in 2001; 3.3% and
3.7% in 2000).
   ASSET  IMPAIRMENTS.  We  periodically  review our long-lived  assets whenever
events indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.  As of
December 31, 2002 and 2001 no write-downs were required.
   ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE.  Accounts  receivable are reported on the balance sheet
net of an  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts.  The  allowance  is  based on our
evaluation of the receivable portfolio under current conditions, the size of the
portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problems and such other
factors that in our judgment deserve recognition in estimating losses.
   AFC,  through a wholly owned  subsidiary,  sells certain finance  receivables
through a revolving private  securitization  structure.  On May 31, 2002 AFC and
its subsidiary entered into a revised  securitization  agreement that allows for
the revolving  sale by the  subsidiary to third parties of up to $500 million in
undivided  interests  in eligible  finance  receivables.  The revised  agreement
expires in 2005.  The  securitization  agreement  in place prior to May 31, 2002
limited the sale of undivided interests to $325 million. In accordance with SFAS
140   "Accounting   for  Transfers   and  Servicing  of  Financial   Assets  and
Extinguishments  of Liabilities,"  which became applicable to AFC upon amendment
of  the  securitization   agreement,   AFC,  for  accounting   purposes,   began
consolidating  the subsidiary  used in the  securitization  structure on June 1,
2002.  Previously,  AFC's interest in this  subsidiary was recorded by ALLETE as
residual  interest in other  current  assets ($103 million at December 31, 2001)
net of the subsidiary's  allowance for doubtful accounts.  The residual interest
previously  reflected  in prior  periods  has been  reclassified  by  ALLETE  to
accounts receivable to conform to current year presentations.
   AFC managed total  receivables of $495.1 million at December 31, 2002 ($500.2
million at December 31, 2001);  $191.3 million represent  receivables which were
included  in accounts  receivable  on our  consolidated  balance  sheet  ($233.2
million at December 31, 2001) and $303.8 million  represent  receivables sold in
undivided  interests  through the  securitization  agreement  ($267.0 million at
December 31, 2001) which are off-balance  sheet. AFC's proceeds from the sale of
the  receivables to third parties were used to repay  borrowings from ALLETE and
fund new loans to AFC's  customers.  AFC and the  subsidiary  must each maintain
certain  financial  covenants such as minimum  tangible net worth to comply with
the terms of the securitization agreement. AFC has historically performed better
than the covenant thresholds set forth in the securitization  agreement.  We are
not  currently  aware  of any   changing  circumstances  that  would  put AFC in
noncompliance with the covenants.

required by SFAS 142,  "Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets,"  goodwill is no
longer  amortized  after  2001.  Prior  to  2002  we  amortized  goodwill  on  a
straight-line basis over 40 years.
   UNAMORTIZED  EXPENSE,  DISCOUNT  AND PREMIUM ON DEBT.  Expense,  discount and
premium on debt are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related issues.
   CASH AND  CASH  EQUIVALENTS.  We  consider  all  investments  purchased  with
maturities  of  three  months  or less to be cash  equivalents.
   ACCOUNTING  FOR  STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION.  We have  elected to account  for
stock-based  compensation in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees."  Accordingly,  no expense is recognized for employee
stock options granted.  Had we applied the fair value recognition  provisions of
SFAS 123,  "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation,"  in 2002 we estimate that
stock-based  compensation  expense would have increased $1.5 million  after-tax,
and basic and diluted  earnings per share would have decreased  $0.02 (basic and
diluted  earnings per share would have been impacted by  approximately  $0.01 in
2001 and 2000);  these amounts were calculated  using the  Black-Scholes  option
pricing model.  Expense is recognized for performance share awards, and amounted
to approximately $4 million after-tax in 2002 ($5 million in 2001; $3 million in
2000).
   FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATION.   Results  of  operations  for  our  Canadian
subsidiaries  are  translated  into  United  States  dollars  using the  average
exchange rates during the period.  Assets and  liabilities  are translated  into
United States dollars using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date,  except
for  intangibles  and fixed assets,  which are  translated at historical  rates.
Resulting  translation   adjustments  are  recorded  in  the  Accumulated  Other
Comprehensive Loss section of Shareholders'  Equity on our consolidated  balance
sheet.
   INCOME TAXES. ALLETE and its subsidiaries file a consolidated  federal income
tax return. Income taxes are allocated to each subsidiary based on their taxable
income.  We account for income taxes using the liability method as prescribed by
SFAS 109,  "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under the liability  method,  deferred
income tax liabilities are established for all temporary differences in the book
and tax basis of assets and  liabilities  based upon  enacted tax laws and rates
applicable to the periods in which the taxes become payable.
   NEW  ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS.   SFAS  143,  "Accounting  for  Asset  Retirement
Obligations,"  requires the  recognition of a liability for an asset  retirement
obligation  in the  period  in  which it is  incurred.  When  the  liability  is
initially  recorded,  the  carrying  amount of the related  long-lived  asset is
correspondingly  increased.  Over time, the liability is accreted to its present
value and the related  capitalized charge is depreciated over the useful life of
the asset. SFAS 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002.
Currently,  decommissioning  amounts  collected in Minnesota  Power's  rates are
reported in  accumulated  depreciation,  which upon  adoption of SFAS 143 by the
Company will require a  reclassification  to a liability.  We are reviewing what
additional  assets,  if any, may have associated  retirement costs as defined by
SFAS 143 and anticipate no material impact on our financial position and results
of operations.
   In  November  2002  the  FASB  issued  Interpretation  No.  45,  "Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness  of Others." The  Interpretation  expands  disclosure
requirements for certain guarantees, and requires the recognition of a liability
for the fair value of an  obligation  assumed  under a guarantee.  The liability
recognition  provisions  apply on a prospective  basis to  guarantees  issued or
modified after December 31, 2002, and the disclosure  provisions apply to fiscal
years  ending after  December  15, 2002.  We do not believe the adoption of this
Interpretation  will have a material impact on our financial position or results
of operations.
   In January  2003 the FASB issued  Interpretation  No. 46,  "Consolidation  of
Variable Interest  Entities." In general, a variable interest entity is one with
equity  investors  that do not have voting  rights or do not provide  sufficient
financial  resources  for the entity to support  its  activities.  Under the new
rules,  variable  interest  entities will be  consolidated  by the party that is
subject to the  majority of the risk of loss or entitled to the  majority of the
residual returns. The new rules are effective  immediately for variable interest
entities  created  after  January 31, 2003 and in the third  quarter of 2003 for
previously existing variable interest entities. We are reviewing certain auction
facility  lease  agreements  entered  into by  ADESA  prior to  January  2003 to
determine (1) if the lessor is a variable interest entity,  and (2) if we should
consolidate  the lessor.  If it is  ultimately  determined  that the lessor is a
variable  interest entity that should be included in our consolidated  financial
statements,  we  estimate  that we will  record  approximately  $73  million  in
property,   plant  and  equipment,  and  $73  million  in  long-term  debt.  Any
recognition of these amounts would first occur in the third quarter of 2003.
   In October 2002 the FASB's  Emerging  Issues Task Force  rescinded EITF Issue
98-10,  "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management
Activities."  The ruling took effect January 1, 2003 for existing  contracts and
immediately for contracts entered into after October 25, 2002. Early adoption is
permitted.  In general,  EITF 98-10  required  energy  trading  contracts  to be
marked-to-market with resulting gains and losses recognized in income. Any gains
or losses  recognized under the provisions of EITF 98-10 through the end of 2002
will be reversed under the transitional  provisions contained in the rescission.
We were required to account for the Kendall  County  agreement  under EITF 98-10
which  resulted in the  recognition  of $4.7 million of  mark-to-market  pre-tax
income in the second quarter of 2002 ($0 in 2001).  We adopted the rescission of
EITF 98-10 in the fourth quarter of 2002 and reversed the mark-to-market  income
recognized earlier in the year. The Kendall County agreement is not a derivative
under SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."

4  ACQUISITIONS

   ADESA AUCTION FACILITIES.  In January 2001 we acquired all of the outstanding
stock of ComSearch in exchange for ALLETE common stock and paid cash to purchase
all of the assets of Auto  Placement  Center (now ADESA Impact) in  transactions
with an aggregate value of $62.4 million. In May 2001 ADESA purchased the assets
of the I-44 Auto Auction in Tulsa,  Oklahoma.  ADESA Impact and ADESA Tulsa were
accounted for using the purchase method and financial results have been included
in our consolidated  financial statements since the date of purchase.  Pro forma
financial results were not material. ComSearch was accounted for as a pooling of
interests. Financial results for prior periods have not been restated to reflect
this pooling due to immateriality.
   In February 2000 ADESA  purchased the Mission City Auto Auction in San Diego,
California. In May 2000 ADESA Canada purchased the remaining 27% of Impact Auto.
ADESA Canada  acquired 20% of Impact Auto on October 1, 1995,  27% in March 1999
and  another  26% in  January  2000.  In June  2000  ADESA  acquired  all of the
outstanding  common shares of Auction Finance Group,  Inc. (AFG). AFG owned CAAG
Auto Auction  Holdings Ltd., which was doing business as Canadian Auction Group.
In August 2000 ADESA acquired  Beebe Auto  Exchange,  Inc. and 51% of Interstate
Auto  Auction.  In October 2000 ADESA  purchased  nine auction  facilities  from
Manheim  Auctions,  Inc.  These  transactions  had a combined  purchase price of
approximately $438 million and resulted in goodwill of $298 million. We used the
purchase  method of accounting for these  transactions.  Financial  results have
been included in our  consolidated  financial  statements since the date of each
purchase. Pro forma financial results were not material.
   ACQUISITION OF ENVENTIS, INC. In July 2001 we acquired Enventis, Inc., a data
network systems  provider  headquartered  in the  Minneapolis-St.  Paul area. In
connection  with this  acquisition,  we issued  310,878  shares of ALLETE common
stock.  Enventis was accounted for as a pooling of interests.  Financial results
for  prior  periods  have not been  restated  to  reflect  this  pooling  due to
immateriality.
   ACQUISITION  OF  GENERATING  FACILITY.  In October  2001 we acquired  certain
non-mining  properties from LTV and  Cleveland-Cliffs  Inc. for $75 million. The
non-mining  properties  included  a  225  MW  nonregulated  electric  generating
facility.
   REAL  ESTATE  ACQUISITIONS.  In  December  2002  our real  estate  subsidiary
purchased  additional  land  near  Palm  Coast,  Florida.  The  transaction  was
accounted for using the purchase method.
   In  September  2001 our real estate  subsidiary  purchased  Winter Haven Citi
Centre, a retail shopping center.  In December 2001 and January 2002 real estate
subsidiaries   purchased   additional  land  in  Palm  Coast,   Florida.   These
transactions had a combined purchase price of approximately $31 million and were

5  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   SECURITIES  INVESTMENTS.  During  the  second  half of 2002 we  substantially
liquidated  our trading  securities  portfolio  and used the  proceeds to reduce
short-term  debt.  Prior  to  liquidation,   the  trading  securities  portfolio
consisted primarily of the common stock of various publicly traded companies and
was  included  in  current  assets at fair  value.  Changes  in fair  value were
recognized in earnings,  and the net unrealized gain included in 2001 income was
$0.9 million ($2.3 million loss in 2000).
   Investments includes certain securities held for an indefinite period of time
and  accounted  for as  available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale  securities  are
recorded at fair value with unrealized  gains and losses included in accumulated
other  comprehensive  income, net of tax.  Unrealized losses that are other than
temporary are recognized in earnings.  Available-for-sale  securities consist of
minority interests in the common stock of  publicly-traded  corporations held in
our Emerging Technology portfolio, and securities in a grantor trust established
to fund certain  employee  benefits.  In 2000, we sold 4.7 million shares of ACE
Limited which we had accounted for as available-for-sale.

   As part of our Emerging Technology  portfolio,  we also have several minority
investments  in venture  capital funds and  privately-held  start-up  companies.
These  investments  are  accounted  for under the cost method and included  with
Investments on our consolidated balance sheet. The total carrying value of these
investments  was $38.7  million at December 31, 2002 ($40.6  million at December
31, 2001). Our policy is to periodically review these investments for impairment
by assessing such factors as continued  commercial  viability of products,  cash
flow and  earnings.  Any  impairment  would  reduce  the  carrying  value of the
investment.
   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISKS. In October 2001 we entered
into an interest rate swap agreement  with a notional  amount of $250 million to
hedge $250  million of  floating  rate debt  issued in October  2000.  Under the
15-month swap agreement,  we made fixed quarterly payments based on a fixed rate
of 3.2% and  received  payments  at a  floating  rate  based  on LIBOR  (1.8% at
December 31, 2002). The swap was recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and
treated as a cash flow  hedge  with  unrealized  gains and  losses  included  in
accumulated other comprehensive income. The swap expired in January 2003 and the
Company did not enter into any new interest rate swap agreements.
   Prior to liquidating the trading securities  portfolio,  we sold common stock
short in strategies designed to reduce market risk.  Unrealized gains and losses
on short sales were recognized in earnings.
   The fair value of  off-balance  sheet  financial  instruments  reflected  the
estimated  amounts that we would receive or pay if the contracts were terminated
at December 31. This fair value represents the difference  between the estimated
future  receipts  and  payments  under  the  terms  of each  instrument,  and is
estimated by obtaining  quoted market prices or by using common pricing  models.
These fair values should not be viewed in  isolation,  but rather in relation to
the fair value of the underlying hedged transaction.

   CONCENTRATION  OF CREDIT  RISK.  Financial  instruments  that  subject  us to
concentrations  of  credit  risk  consist  primarily  of  accounts   receivable.
Minnesota Power sells electricity to about 15 customers in northern  Minnesota's
taconite,  pipeline, paper and wood products industries.  Receivables from these
customers totaled  approximately $10 million at December 31, 2002 ($9 million at
December  31,  2001).  Minnesota  Power  does not obtain  collateral  to support
utility receivables, but monitors the credit standing of major customers.
   Due to the nature of our Automotive  Services'  business,  substantially  all
trade and finance  receivables  are due from  automobile  dealers and  insurance
companies.   We  have   possession   of   automobiles   or   automobile   titles
collateralizing a significant portion of the trade and finance receivables.

6  INVESTMENT IN ACE

   In May 2000 we recorded a $30.4 million,  or $0.44 per share,  after-tax gain
on the sale of 4.7 million shares of ACE Limited. We received 4.7 million shares
of ACE plus $25.1  million in December  1999 when Capital Re merged with ACE. At
the time of the merger we owned 7.3 million shares, or 20%, of Capital Re.

7  JOINTLY OWNED ELECTRIC FACILITY

   We own 80% of the 531-MW Boswell Energy Center Unit 4 (Boswell Unit 4). While
we operate the plant,  certain  decisions about the operations of Boswell Unit 4
are subject to the  oversight  of a committee on which we and  Wisconsin  Public
Power,  Inc.  (WPPI),  the owner of the other 20% of Boswell  Unit 4, have equal
representation and voting rights.  Each of us must provide our own financing and
is obligated to pay our ownership share of operating  costs. Our share of direct
operating  expenses of Boswell  Unit 4 is included in  operating  expense on our
consolidated statement of income. Our 80% share of the original cost included in
electric  plant at December 31, 2002 was $310 million  ($309 million at December
31, 2001). The corresponding  accumulated  depreciation balance was $170 million
at December 31, 2002 ($163 million at December 31, 2001).

8  REGULATORY MATTERS

   We file for periodic  rate  revisions  with the  Minnesota  Public  Utilities
Commission  (MPUC),  the Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission and other state
regulatory  authorities.  Interim  rates in  Minnesota  are placed into  effect,
subject to refund with  interest,  pending a final  decision by the  appropriate
commission.  In 2002 31% of our consolidated operating revenue (31% in 2001; 41%
in 2000) was under regulatory authority.  The MPUC had regulatory authority over
approximately  25% in 2002  (25%  in  2001;  33% in  2000)  of our  consolidated
operating revenue.
   ELECTRIC  RATES.  New  federal  legislation  and FERC  regulations  have been
proposed that aim to maintain  reliability,  assure adequate energy supply,  and
address  wholesale price volatility  while  encouraging  wholesale  competition.
Legislation  or  regulation  that  initiates a process  which may lead to retail
customer choice of their electric service  provider  currently lacks momentum in
both Minnesota and Wisconsin. Legislative and regulatory activity as well as the
actions of competitors  affect the way Minnesota Power  strategically  plans for
its future. We cannot predict the timing or substance of any future  legislation
or regulation.
   DEFERRED  REGULATORY CHARGES AND CREDITS.  Our utility operations are subject
to the  provisions of SFAS 71,  "Accounting  for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation." We capitalize as deferred  regulatory  charges incurred costs which
are probable of recovery in future utility rates.  Deferred  regulatory  credits
represent  amounts  expected  to be  credited to  customers  in rates.  Deferred
regulatory   charges  and  credits  are  included  in  other  assets  and  other
liabilities on our consolidated  balance sheet.

9  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

   In  September  2001 we  began a  process  of  systematically  evaluating  our
businesses to determine  the  strategic  value of our assets and explore ways to
unlock that value. As a result, our management and Board of Directors  committed
to a plan to sell our Water Services  businesses.  Water Services includes water
and  wastewater  services  operated  by several  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  in
Florida, North Carolina and Georgia. During the first half of 2002 we exited our
nonregulated  water  subsidiaries,  our auto  transport  business and our retail
store. The financial results for all of these businesses have been accounted for
as  discontinued  operations.  Accordingly,  we  ceased  depreciation  of assets
related to these businesses in the fourth quarter of 2001.  Depreciation expense
in 2001 was $7.5 million after tax ($8.1 million after tax for 2000).
     In  September  2002  Florida  Water  entered  into an agreement to sell its
assets to FWSA, a governmental  authority that was  established by an interlocal
agreement between the cities of Gulf Breeze and Milton, Florida. On December 20,
2002 Florida  Water signed an amended  asset  purchase  agreement  adjusting the
sales  price for the sale of  substantially  all of its assets to the FWSA.  The
sales price was adjusted to $456.5  million from $471 million.  This  adjustment
was made to reflect primarily higher interest rates on bonds to be issued by the
FWSA to finance the transaction.
   Florida Water anticipates receiving approximately $420 million at closing and
an additional $36.5 million three years after closing once certain contingencies
have been  satisfied.  In addition,  Florida  Water expects to receive up to $36
million of future customer  hookup fees to be paid over the next six years.  The
revised purchase price, combined with the additional payments,  brings the total
amount  expected to be  received  in the  transaction  to $492.5  million.  Cash
proceeds to ALLETE after taxes and repayment of existing debt are expected to be
approximately $180 million in 2003, and $250 million for the entire transaction.
The gain on the transaction is estimated at $100 million after taxes and related
costs.  While the majority of the cash will be received at closing,  the gain is
hoped to be recognized in future years as required by accounting rules.
   Eleven lawsuits  seeking to halt the sale of Florida Water assets to the FWSA
have been  filed,  primarily  by local  governments  which had hoped to purchase
Florida  Water's assets through a competing  buyer.  Pursuant to notice given on
January  28,  2003,  the FPSC held an agenda  conference  on February 4, 2003 in
which it ordered  Florida Water to file, in advance of closing the  transaction,
an  application  requesting  approval of the transfer of its assets to the FWSA,
and further ordered Florida Water to refrain from closing the transaction before
FPSC  approval.  Florida Water is asking a court to determine  that the FPSC may
not delay closing of the sale and is required by law to approve this transfer as
a matter of right.  Florida Water considers the lawsuits to be without merit and
is vigorously contesting these lawsuits. Litigation challenging this transaction
continues to delay its closing.
   We are using an  investment  banking  firm to  facilitate  the sale of Heater
Utilities,  Inc. and Georgia Water Services  Corporation  and  discussions  with
prospective  buyers are in process.  We expect to sell these businesses in 2003.

   The aggregate amount of long-term debt maturing during 2003 is $283.7 million
($15.6  million in 2004;  $1.4 million in 2005;  $91.9  million in 2006;  $168.7
million  in 2007;  and  $383.7  million  thereafter).  Substantially  all of our
electric  plant is subject to the lien of the mortgages  securing  various first
mortgage bonds.
   At December 31, 2002 we had long-term bank lines of credit  aggregating $39.7
million ($5.0 million at December 31,  2001).  Drawn  portions on these lines of
credit were $5.5 million in 2002 ($0 million in 2001).
   The 6.68% Series Due 2007 and the 7% Series Due 2007 cannot be redeemed prior
to maturity.  The 7 1/2% Series Due 2007 are redeemable after August 1, 2005 and
the 7% Series Due 2008 are redeemable  after March 1, 2006. The remaining  bonds
may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option  according to the terms of the
obligations.

11  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND COMPENSATING BALANCES

   We have bank lines of credit  aggregating  $217.0 million  ($264.5 million at
December 31, 2001), which make financing available through short-term bank loans
and provide credit support for commercial  paper.  At December 31, 2002,  $210.3
million was available  for use ($234 million at December 31, 2001).  At December
31,  2002 we had issued  commercial  paper  with a face  value of $74.0  million
($238.2 million in 2001), with support provided by bank lines of credit.
   Certain lines of credit require a commitment  fee of 0.0150%.  Interest rates
on commercial  paper and borrowings  under the lines of credit ranged from 1.75%
to 1.85% at  December  31,  2002  (2.75% to 3.10% at  December  31,  2001).  The
weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings at December 31, 2002 was
1.79% (2.96% at December 31, 2001). The total amount of compensating balances at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, was immaterial.

12  PREFERRED STOCK

   In 2000 we redeemed  all of our  outstanding  Preferred  Stock and  Preferred
Stock A with proceeds from the sale of a portion of our securities portfolio and
internally generated funds.
   All 100,000 shares of Serial  Preferred  Stock A, $7.125 Series were redeemed
in April 2000 for an  aggregate  of $10  million.  All 100,000  shares of Serial
Preferred  Stock A, $6.70 Series were  redeemed in July 2000 for an aggregate of
$10 million.  All 113,358  shares of 5% Preferred  Stock were redeemed in August
2000 at $102.50 per share plus  accrued and unpaid  dividends of $0.75 per share
for an aggregate of $11.7 million.

13  COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES

   SQUARE BUTTE POWER PURCHASE  AGREEMENT.  Minnesota Power has a power purchase
agreement with Square Butte that extends through 2026 (Agreement). It provides a
long-term  supply  of  low-cost  energy to  customers  in our  electric  service
territory and enables  Minnesota Power to meet power pool reserve  requirements.
Square Butte, a North Dakota cooperative  corporation,  owns a 455-MW coal-fired
generating  unit (Unit) near  Center,  North  Dakota.  The Unit is adjacent to a
generating unit owned by Minnkota Power, a North Dakota cooperative  corporation
whose Class A members are also members of Square Butte. Minnkota Power serves as
the operator of the Unit and also purchases power from Square Butte.
   Minnesota Power is entitled to  approximately  71% of the Unit's output under
the Agreement.  After 2005 and upon  compliance  with a two-year  advance notice
requirement,  Minnkota has the option to reduce Minnesota Power's entitlement by
5% annually,  to a minimum of 50%.  Minnesota  Power is obligated to pay its pro
rata share of Square  Butte's costs based on Minnesota  Power's  entitlement  to
Unit output.  Minnesota Power's payment  obligation is suspended if Square Butte
fails to deliver any power,  whether produced or purchased,  for a period of one
year. Square Butte's fixed costs consist primarily of debt service.  At December
31, 2002 Square Butte had total debt outstanding of $281.9 million. Total annual
debt  service for Square  Butte is expected to be $23.6  million in 2003 through
2007.  Variable  operating  costs include the price of coal  purchased  from BNI
Coal, our subsidiary, under a long-term contract.
   Minnesota  Power's cost of power  purchased from Square Butte during 2002 was
$60.9 million ($63.3  million in 2001 and $58.7 million in 2000).  This reflects
Minnesota  Power's pro rata share of total  Square  Butte costs based on the 71%
output entitlement in 2002, 2001 and 2000. Included in this amount was Minnesota
Power's  pro rata  share of  interest  expense of $13.7  million in 2002  ($14.2
million in 2001;  $14.8 million in 2000).  Minnesota  Power's payments to Square
Butte are approved as purchased  power expense for  ratemaking  purposes by both
the MPUC and FERC.
   LEASING AGREEMENTS. In July 2001 ADESA entered into a lease agreement for the
ADESA  Golden Gate  facility in Tracy,  California,  which was  completed in the
third  quarter  of 2002.  The term of the  lease is  through  July  2006 with no
renewal options.  The cost to the lessor of the facility was  approximately  $45
million.  ADESA has  guaranteed  up to $38  million of any  deficiency  in sales
proceeds  that the lessor  realizes in disposing of the leased  property.  ADESA
will receive any sales proceeds in excess of cost.
   ADESA has  guaranteed the payment of principal and interest up to $38 million
on the lessor's indebtedness. Terms of the mortgage notes payable require, among
other things,  that ADESA maintain certain minimum  financial  ratios. It is not
practical to estimate the fair value of the guarantee;  however,  ADESA does not
anticipate  that it will  incur  losses as a result of this  guarantee.  We have
guaranteed ADESA's obligation under this lease.
   In April 2000 leases for three ADESA auction  facilities  (Boston,  Charlotte
and Knoxville)  were  refinanced in a $28.4 million lease  transaction.  The new
lease is treated as an  operating  lease for  financial  reporting  purposes and
expires in April 2010 with no renewal  options.  ADESA has  guaranteed up to $23
million  of any  deficiency  in sales  proceeds  that  the  lessor  realizes  in
disposing  of the leased  properties.  ADESA is  entitled  to receive  any sales
proceeds in excess of $29.3 million.
   ADESA has  guaranteed the payment of principal and interest up to $23 million
on the lessor's indebtedness,  which consists of $28.4 million in mortgage notes
payable,  due April 1, 2020. Terms of the mortgage notes payable require,  among
other things, that ADESA maintain certain minimum financial ratios.  Interest on
the notes  varies and is payable  monthly.  It is not  practical to estimate the
fair value of the guarantee;  however,  ADESA does not  anticipate  that it will
incur  losses  as a  result  of  this  guarantee.  We  have  guaranteed  ADESA's
obligations under this lease.
   We lease other  properties  and  equipment  in addition to those listed above
under operating lease agreements with terms expiring through 2010. The aggregate
amount of future  minimum  lease  payments for  operating  leases during 2003 is
$17.5 million  ($13.9  million in 2004;  $11.2 million in 2005;  $9.4 million in
2006;  $9.0 million in 2007; and $59.0 million  thereafter).  Total rent expense
was $27.5 million in 2002 ($26.9 million in 2001; $21.1 million in 2000).
   SPLIT ROCK ENERGY.  We provide up to $50.0 million of credit support,  in the
form of letters of credit and  financial  guarantees,  to  facilitate  the power
marketing  activities  of Split Rock Energy.  At December 31, 2002 $10.5 million
was used to support actual  obligations ($3.4 million at December 31, 2001). The
credit support generally expires within one year from the date of issuance.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


   KENDALL  COUNTY  POWER  PURCHASE  AGREEMENT.   We  have  secured  275  MW  of
nonregulated  generation (non rate-base generation sold at market-based rates to
the wholesale  market) through a tolling  agreement with NRG Energy that extends
through  September 2017.  Under the agreement we pay a fixed capacity charge for
the right, but not the obligation,  to utilize one 275 MW generating unit at NRG
Energy's  Kendall  County  facility  near  Chicago,  Illinois.  The annual fixed
capacity  charge is $21.8  million.  We are also  responsible  for arranging the
natural gas fuel supply.
   Our  strategy  is to enter into  long-term  contracts  to sell a  significant
portion of the 275 MW from the Kendall County facility; the balance will be sold
in the spot market through  short-term  agreements.  We currently have two 50 MW
long-term  forward  capacity and energy sales  contracts for the Kendall  County
generation,  with one  expiring in April 2012 and the other in  September  2017.
Neither  the  Kendall  County  agreement  nor the related  sales  contracts  are
derivatives under SFAS 133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities."
   EMERGING TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS. We have investments in emerging technologies
through the  minority  ownership  of  preferred  stock,  common stock and equity
interests  in  limited  liability   companies.   The  investments  are  in  both
privately-held  and  publicly-traded   entities.   We  have  committed  to  make
additional investments in certain emerging technology holdings. The total future
commitment  was $7.7 million at December 31, 2002 ($11.0 million at December 31,
2001).  We expect  approximately  $1  million  of the  future  commitment  to be
invested in 2003, with the balance to be invested at various times through 2007.
   ENVIRONMENTAL  MATTERS.  Some of our  businesses are subject to regulation by
various federal, state and local authorities  concerning  environmental matters.
We do not currently  anticipate that potential  expenditures  for  environmental
matters will be material.

14  MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY

   ALLETE Capital I (Trust) was established as a wholly owned statutory trust of
the Company for the purpose of issuing  common and preferred  securities  (Trust
Securities).  In March  1996 the  Trust  publicly  issued  three  million  8.05%
Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (QUIPS), representing preferred
beneficial interests in the assets held by the Trust. The proceeds from the sale
of the QUIPS, and from common securities of the Trust issued to us, were used by
the  Trust to  purchase  from us $77.5  million  of  8.05%  Junior  Subordinated
Debentures,  Series  A, Due 2015  (Subordinated  Debentures),  resulting  in net
proceeds to us of $72.3  million.  Holders of the QUIPS are  entitled to receive
quarterly distributions at an annual rate of 8.05% of the liquidation preference
value of $25 per security.  We have the right to defer interest  payments on the
Subordinated   Debentures   which  would  result  in  the  similar  deferral  of
distributions  on  the  QUIPS  during  extension  periods  up to 20  consecutive
quarters.  We  are  the  owner  of all of the  common  trust  securities,  which
constitute approximately 3% of the aggregate liquidation amount of all the Trust
Securities. The sole asset of the Trust is the Subordinated Debentures, interest
on which is  deductible  by us for  income  tax  purposes.  The  Trust  will use
interest payments  received on the Subordinated  Debentures it holds to make the
quarterly cash distributions on the QUIPS.
   The  QUIPS  are  subject  to  mandatory  redemption  upon  repayment  of  the
Subordinated  Debentures at maturity or upon  redemption.  We have the option to
redeem the Subordinated Debentures at any time.
   We  have  guaranteed,  on  a  subordinated  basis,  payment  of  the  Trust's
obligations.

     PLAN.

</TABLE>
   COMMON STOCK ISSUANCE. In May and June 2001 we sold 6.6 million shares of our
common  stock in a public  offering at $23.68 per share.  Total net  proceeds of
approximately  $150  million  were  used to repay a  portion  of our  short-term
borrowings with the remainder invested in short-term instruments.
   SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN. In 1996 we adopted a rights plan that provides for a
dividend  distribution  of one  preferred  share  purchase  right  (Right) to be
attached to each share of common stock.
   The Rights,  which are currently not exercisable or  transferable  apart from
our common stock, entitle the holder to purchase one two-hundredth of a share of
ALLETE's  Junior  Serial  Preferred  Stock A, without par value,  at an exercise
price of $45.  These  Rights  would  become  exercisable  if a  person  or group
acquires beneficial  ownership of 15% or more of our common stock or announces a
tender offer which would increase the person's or group's  beneficial  ownership
interest to 15% or more of our common stock,  subject to certain exceptions.  If
the 15%  threshold  is met,  each  Right  entitles  the holder  (other  than the
acquiring   person  or  group)  to  purchase   common   stock  (or,  in  certain
circumstances, cash, property or other securities of ours) having a market price
equal to twice the exercise  price of the Right.  If we are acquired in a merger
or business combination, or 50% or more of our assets or earning power are sold,
each  exercisable  Right  entitles  the holder to purchase  common  stock of the
acquiring or surviving  company having a value equal to twice the exercise price
of  the  Right.  Certain  stock  acquisitions  will  also  trigger  a  provision
permitting  the Board of Directors  to exchange  each Right for one share of our
common stock.
   The Rights which expire on July 23, 2006,  are  nonvoting and may be redeemed
by us at a price of $0.005 per Right at any time they are not  exercisable.  One
million shares of Junior Serial  Preferred  Stock A have been authorized and are
reserved for issuance under the plan.
   EARNINGS PER SHARE.  The  difference  between basic and diluted  earnings per
share arises from outstanding stock options and performance share awards granted
under our Executive and Director Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plans.

   The Deferred Tax Asset Valuation  Allowance is for state net operating losses
that the Company  believes  more  likely  than not will  expire  before they are
utilized. These state net operating losses expire between 2003 and 2021.
   UNDISTRIBUTED  EARNINGS.  Undistributed  earnings of our foreign subsidiaries
were approximately $28.8 million at December 31, 2002 ($36.3 million at December
31, 2001).  Since this amount has been or will be reinvested in property,  plant
and working capital,  the Company has not recorded the deferred taxes associated
with the remittance of these investments.

18  PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

   Certain eligible employees of ALLETE are covered by  noncontributory  defined
benefit  pension  plans.  At December 31, 2002  approximately  8% of the defined
benefit  pension plan assets were invested in our common stock.  We have defined
contribution pension plans covering eligible employees,  for which the aggregate
annual  cost was $8.0  million in 2002 ($7.1  million in 2001;  $5.7  million in
2000). We provide  certain health care and life insurance  benefits for eligible
retired employees.
   The assumed  health care cost trend rate  declines  gradually  to an ultimate
rate of 5% by 2008. For postretirement  health and life benefits,  a 1% increase
in the assumed health care cost trend rate would result in a $13.4 million and a
$1.3 million  increase in the benefit  obligation and total service and interest
costs,  respectively;  a 1% decrease  would  result in a $11.0  million and $1.1
million decrease in the benefit obligation and total service and interest costs,
respectively.

19  EMPLOYEE STOCK AND INCENTIVE PLANS

   EMPLOYEE  STOCK  OWNERSHIP  PLAN.  We  sponsor  a  leveraged  employee  stock
ownership  plan (ESOP) within the  Retirement  Savings and Stock  Ownership Plan
that covers certain eligible employees.  In 1989 the ESOP used the proceeds from
a $16.5  million  third-party  loan  guaranteed  by us, to purchase  1.2 million
shares of our common stock on the open market.  The remaining  principal balance
on the loan was refinanced in 2002. The refinanced loan has a variable  interest
rate based on LIBOR and matures on December 31, 2004.  In 1990 the ESOP issued a
$75 million note (term not to exceed 25 years at 10.25%) to us as  consideration
for 5.6 million  shares of our newly  issued  common  stock.  The Company  makes
annual contributions to the ESOP equal to the ESOP's debt service less available
dividends  received by the ESOP. The majority of dividends  received by the ESOP
are  used  to  pay  debt  service,  with  the  balance  distributed  to  certain
participants. The ESOP shares were initially pledged as collateral for its debt.
As the debt is repaid,  shares are released  from  collateral  and  allocated to
participants,  based on the  proportion  of debt service  paid in the year.  The
third-party  debt of the ESOP is  recorded  as  long-term  debt  and the  shares
pledged as collateral are reported as unearned ESOP shares in the Balance Sheet.
As shares are released from collateral, the Company reports compensation expense
equal  to the  current  market  price  of the  shares,  and  the  shares  become
outstanding  for  earnings-per-share  computations.  Dividends on allocated ESOP
shares are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings;  available dividends on
unallocated  ESOP  shares  are  recorded  as a  reduction  of debt  and  accrued
interest.  ESOP  compensation  expense was $3.9 million in 2002 ($2.6 million in
2001; $2.3 million in 2000).

   STOCK  OPTION  AND AWARD  PLANS.  We have an  Executive  Long-Term  Incentive
Compensation Plan (Executive Plan) and a Director Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan
(Director  Plan).  The Executive  Plan allows for the grant of up to 9.7 million
shares of our common stock to key  employees.  To date,  these grants have taken
the form of stock options, performance share awards and restricted stock awards.
The Director Plan allows for the grant of up to 0.3 million shares of our common
stock to nonemployee  directors.  Each nonemployee  director  receives an annual
grant of 1,500 stock options and a biennial grant of performance shares equal to
$10,000  in  value of  common  stock at the date of  grant.  Stock  options  are
exercisable  at the market  price of common  shares on the date the  options are
granted,  and vest in equal annual  installments  over two years with expiration
ten years from the date of grant.  Performance shares are earned over multi-year
time periods and are contingent upon the attainment of certain performance goals
of ALLETE.  Restricted stock vests once certain periods of time have elapsed. At
December  31, 2002 4.3  million and 0.2 million  shares were held in reserve for
future issuance under the Executive Plan and Director Plan, respectively.
   We  have  elected  to  account  for our  stock-based  compensation  plans  in
accordance with the Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees," and accordingly,  compensation  expense has not been
recognized for stock options  granted.  Compensation  expense is recognized over
the vesting  periods for  performance  and restricted  share awards based on the
market value of our common stock,  and was  approximately $6 million in 2002 ($9
million in 2001; $5 million in 2000).
