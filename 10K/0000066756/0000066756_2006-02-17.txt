                              SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
           UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

In  connection  with  the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995,  we are  hereby  filing  cautionary  statements
identifying  important  factors  that could  cause our actual  results to differ
materially from those projected in  forward-looking  statements (as such term is
defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995) made by or on
behalf of ALLETE  in this  Annual  Report on Form  10-K,  in  presentations,  in
response to questions or otherwise.  Any  statements  that  express,  or involve
discussions as to,  expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions or
future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or
phrases such as "anticipates,"  "believes,"  "estimates,"  "expects," "intends,"
"plans,"  "projects,"  "will likely  result," "will  continue,"  "could," "may,"
"potential,"  "target," "outlook" or similar  expressions) are not statements of
historical facts and may be forward-looking.

Forward-looking   statements   involve   estimates,   assumptions,   risks   and
uncertainties,  and are  qualified in their  entirety by  reference  to, and are
accompanied by, the following  important factors, in addition to any assumptions
and  other  factors   referred  to   specifically   in   connection   with  such
forward-looking   statements,   which  are   difficult   to   predict,   contain
uncertainties,  are beyond our control and may cause actual  results or outcomes
to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements:

   -     our ability to successfully implement our strategic objectives;
   -     our ability to manage expansion and integrate acquisitions;
   -     prevailing  governmental  policies  and  regulatory  actions, including
         those of the United States Congress, state legislatures,  the FERC, the
         MPUC, the FPSC, the PSCW, and various local and county regulators,  and
         city  administrators,   about  allowed  rates  of  return,  financings,
         industry  and rate  structure,  acquisition  and disposal of assets and
         facilities,  real estate  development,  operation and  construction  of
         plant facilities,  recovery of purchased power and capital investments,
         present or prospective wholesale and retail competition  (including but
         not limited to transmission  costs),  and zoning and permitting of land
         held for resale;
   -     effects of restructuring initiatives in the electric industry;
   -     economic and  geographic  factors,  including  political  and  economic
         risks;
   -     changes in and  compliance  with  environmental  and  safety  laws  and
         policies;
   -     weather conditions;
   -     natural disasters;
   -     war and acts of terrorism;
   -     wholesale power market conditions;
   -     our ability to obtain viable real estate for development purposes;
   -     population growth rates and demographic patterns;
   -     the effects  of  competition,  including  competition  for  retail  and
         wholesale customers;
   -     pricing and transportation of commodities;
   -     changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
   -     unanticipated project delays or changes in project costs;
   -     unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;
   -     global and domestic economic conditions;
   -     our ability to access capital markets;
   -     changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets;
   -     competition for economic expansion or development opportunities;
   -     our  ability  to  replace  a  mature  workforce, and  retain qualified,
         skilled and experienced personnel; and
   -     the outcome of legal and administrative  proceedings  (whether civil or
         criminal) and settlements that affect the business and profitability of
         ALLETE.

Additional  disclosures  regarding  factors  that could  cause our  results  and
performance to differ from results or performance anticipated by this report are
discussed in Item 1A under the heading  "Risk  Factors"  beginning on page 23 of
this Form 10-K.  Any  forward-looking  statement  speaks  only as of the date on
which such  statement  is made,  and we undertake  no  obligation  to update any
forward-looking  statement to reflect events or circumstances  after the date on
which that  statement  is made or to reflect  the  occurrence  of  unanticipated
events.  New  factors  emerge  from  time to time,  and it is not  possible  for
management to predict all of these factors, nor can it assess the impact of each
of these factors on the  businesses of ALLETE or the extent to which any factor,
or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ  materially  from
those contained in any forward-looking statement. Readers are urged to carefully
review and consider the various  disclosures made by us in this Form 10-K and in
our other reports filed with the SEC that attempt to advise  interested  parties
of the factors that may affect our business.

DISCONTINUED  OPERATIONS.  We   successfully  completed   the  spin-off  of  our
Automotive  Services  business,  and the  sales of our  Water  Services  and our
telecommunications businesses.

SPIN-OFF  OF  AUTOMOTIVE  SERVICES.  Through  a June 2004  IPO,  our  Automotive
Services business, doing business as ADESA, Inc. (NYSE: KAR), issued 6.3 million
shares of common stock,  representing 6.6% of ADESA's common stock  outstanding.
In  September  2004,  we  spun  off  the  business  by  distributing  to  ALLETE
shareholders all of ALLETE's remaining 93.4% of ADESA common stock.

SALE OF WATER SERVICES BUSINESSES. In early 2005, we completed the exit from our
Water Services  businesses with the sale of our wastewater assets in Georgia. In
mid-2004,  we sold our North  Carolina  water  and  wastewater  assets,  and our
remaining 72 water and wastewater  systems in Florida.  Substantially all of our
water assets in Florida were sold in 2003, under condemnation or imminent threat
of condemnation. The net cash proceeds from the sale of all water and wastewater
assets in 2003 and 2004,  after  transaction  costs,  retirement of most Florida
Water debt and payment of income taxes,  were  approximately  $300  million.  In
2005, the FPSC ordered a $1.7 million reduction to plant  investment,  which the
Company  reserved  for in 2005,  and  approved  the  transfer  of 63  water  and
wastewater systems from Florida Water to Aqua Utilities.  Aqua Utilities filed a
protest and requested that the FPSC schedule  evidentiary  hearings.  The FPSC's
decision on these issues may change the reduction to plant investment ordered in
2005 and could result in an adjustment to the final  purchase price paid by Aqua
Utilities.

SALE OF ENVENTIS  TELECOM.  On December 30,  2005,  we sold all the stock of our
telecommunications  subsidiary,  Enventis  Telecom,  to  HickoryTech of Mankato,
Minnesota,  for $35.5 million.  The transaction resulted in an after-tax loss of
$3.6 million, which was included in our 2005 loss from discontinued  operations.
Net cash proceeds  realized from the sale were  approximately  $29 million after
transaction costs, repayment of debt and payment of income taxes.

ENERGY - REGULATED UTILITY (CONTINUED)

We have electric transmission and distribution lines of 500 kV (8 miles), 230 kV
(605 miles),  161 kV (43 miles),  138 kV (126 miles),  115 kV (1,209  miles) and
less than 115 kV (6,773 miles).  We own and operate 185 substations with a total
capacity of 8,872  megavoltamperes.  Some of our  transmission  and distribution
lines interconnect with other utilities.

We own offices and service buildings, an energy control center and repair shops,
and lease offices and storerooms in various localities. Substantially all of our
electric  plant is subject to mortgages,  which  collateralize  the  outstanding
first mortgage  bonds of Minnesota  Power and of SWL&P.  Generally,  we hold fee
interest in our real properties subject only to the lien of the mortgages.  Most
of our  electric  lines are located on land not owned in fee, but are covered by
appropriate   easement  rights  or  by  necessary   permits  from   governmental
authorities.  Wisconsin  Public Power,  Inc.  (WPPI) owns 20% of Boswell Unit 4.
WPPI has the right to use our  transmission  line  facilities  to transport  its
share of Boswell generation. (See Note 9.)

SPLIT ROCK ENERGY was a joint venture  between  Minnesota  Power and Great River
Energy. In March 2004, we terminated our ownership interest upon receipt of FERC
approval.

Minnesota Power has wholesale contracts with 16 municipal  customers,  SWL&P and
Dahlberg  Light & Power Company in rural  Wisconsin.  (See  Regulatory  Issues -
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.)

Approximately  60% of the ore consumed by  integrated  steel  facilities  in the
United  States  originates  from six  taconite  customers  of  Minnesota  Power.
Taconite, an iron-bearing rock of relatively low iron content that is abundantly
available in Minnesota,  is an important domestic source of raw material for the
steel  industry.  Taconite  processing  plants use large  quantities of electric
power to grind the  ore-bearing  rock,  and  agglomerate  and pelletize the iron
particles into taconite pellets.  Strong worldwide steel demand,  driven largely
by extensive  infrastructure  development in China,  has resulted in very robust
world iron ore and steel  pricing  and has  consequently  resulted  in very high
demand  for iron ore and steel.  This  globalization  of demand  has  positively
impacted  Minnesota  taconite  producers,  which all  produced  near their rated
capacities in both 2005 and 2004. Annual taconite production in Minnesota was 41
million tons in 2005 (41 million tons in 2004; 35 million tons in 2003).  Recent
consolidation activities, combined with the strong steel market, have placed the
Minnesota taconite producers in a strong position. During 2005, Cleveland-Cliffs
Inc and United States Steel Corporation  invested  significant  capital to bring
production capacity back online and/or improve operating efficiencies. They also
invested in required pollution control equipment to help insure the longevity of
their operations.

In addition  to serving the  taconite  industry,  Minnesota  Power also serves a
number of customers in the paper and pulp, and wood products industry. In total,
we serve four major paper and pulp mills directly and one paper mill  indirectly
by providing  wholesale  service to the retail  provider of the mill.  Minnesota
Power also serves four wood products manufacturers.

Minnesota  Power's paper and pulp customers ran at or very near full capacity in
2005 despite the fact that after an economic rebound in 2004, the North American
paper industry had a somewhat more difficult year in 2005. As the industry faced
slightly lower demand,  as well as increased  fiber,  chemical and energy costs,
Minnesota Power's customers  benefited from the temporary or permanent idling of
capacity in North  America at mills other than those served by Minnesota  Power,
the  strength  of the Euro and a  Finnish  paper  industry  labor  strike  which
temporarily idled capacity.

ENERGY - REGULATED UTILITY (CONTINUED)

The pipeline and refining industry is the third key industrial segment served by
Minnesota  Power  with  services  provided  to two crude oil  pipelines  and one
refinery. After years of near capacity operation in 2004 and 2005, both pipeline
operators are evaluating  expansion  alternatives  to transport  newly developed
Western  Canadian  crude oil  reserves  (Alberta  Oil  Sands)  to United  States
markets.  Access to  traditional  Midwest  markets is being expanded to southern
markets as the Canadian supply is displacing  domestic production and deliveries
imported from the Gulf Coast.

LARGE  POWER  CUSTOMER  CONTRACTS.  Minnesota  Power  has large  power  customer
contracts with 12 customers (Large Power  Customers),  11 of which require 10 MW
or more of generating  capacity and one that requires 8 MW or more of generating
capacity.  In 2005,  contracts were  successfully  renegotiated with five of our
Large Power Customers  representing  approximately 23% of 2005 regulated utility
revenue.  The durations of these contracts were extended  several years with the
termination  dates ranging from  February 28, 2010,  to October 13, 2013.  Large
Power Customer  contracts  require  Minnesota  Power to have a certain amount of
generating  capacity  available.  (See Minimum Revenue and Demand Under Contract
table.) In turn,  each Large Power Customer is required to pay a minimum monthly
demand charge that covers the fixed costs  associated  with having this capacity
available  to serve the  customer,  including  a return on common  equity.  Most
contracts  allow  customers  to establish  the level of  megawatts  subject to a
demand charge on a biannual (power pool season) or four-month  basis and require
that a portion of their megawatt  needs be committed on a take-or-pay  basis for
at least a portion of the  agreement.  In  addition to the demand  charge,  each
Large Power Customer is billed an energy charge for each  kilowatthour used that
recovers the variable costs incurred in generating electricity. Six of the Large
Power Customers have  interruptible  service for a portion of their needs, which
provides  a  discounted  demand  rate and  energy  priced at  Minnesota  Power's
incremental cost after serving all firm power obligations.  Minnesota Power also
provides  incremental  production  service for customer  demand levels above the
contract  take-or-pay  levels.  There is no demand  charge for this  service and
energy is priced at an  increment  above  Minnesota  Power's  cost.  Incremental
production service is interruptible.

All contracts  continue past the contract  termination date, unless the required
advance  notice  of  cancellation   has  been  given.   The  advance  notice  of
cancellation  varies from one to four years. Such contracts  minimize the impact
on  earnings  that  otherwise  would  result  from  significant   reductions  in
kilowatthour sales to such customers. Large Power Customers are required to take
all of their purchased  electric service  requirements  from Minnesota Power for
the duration of their contracts.  The rates and corresponding revenue associated
with capacity and energy  provided  under these  contracts are subject to change
through the same regulatory  process  governing all retail electric rates.  (See
Regulatory Issues - Electric Rates.)

Minnesota Power, as permitted by the MPUC, requires its taconite-producing Large
Power  Customers to pay weekly for electric  usage based on monthly energy usage
estimates.  A normal  30-day  billing  cycle with a 15-day  payment  period left
Minnesota Power greatly exposed to a significant  revenue loss if a customer did
not or could not make payment due to discontinued operations,  or delayed making
an electric service payment pending a bankruptcy  filing.  The customers receive
estimated bills based on Minnesota  Power's  prediction of the customer's energy
usage, forecasted energy prices and fuel clause adjustment estimates.  Minnesota
Power's five taconite-producing Large Power Customers have generally predictable
energy  usage on a  week-to-week  basis,  which makes the  variance  between the
estimated usage and actual usage small. Taconite-producing Large Power Customers
subject to weekly billings receive interest on the money paid to Minnesota Power
within the billing cycle.

<F1>   Based on past experience, we believe revenue from our Large Power Customers will be substantially  in  excess of
       the minimum  contract  amounts. For example, in our 2004  Form 10-K we stated 2005  minimum  annual revenue from
       these Large Power Customers would be $69.1 million. Actual 2005 demand  revenue from these Large Power Customers
       was $115.5 million.
<F2>   Although several contracts have a feature that allows demand to go to zero after a  two-year advance  notice  of
       a permanent closure,  this minimum revenue summary does not reflect this occurrence happening  in the forecasted
       period because we believe it is unlikely.

PURCHASED POWER

Minnesota  Power has  contracts  to purchase  capacity  and energy from  various
entities, the largest is with Square Butte. Under an agreement with Square Butte
expiring  at  the  end  of  2026,  Minnesota  Power  is  currently  entitled  to
approximately 66% (60% beginning in 2007; 55% in 2008) of the output of a 455-MW
coal-fired generating unit located near Center, North Dakota. (See Note 10.)

In May 2005,  Minnesota Power entered into a 25-year agreement with an affiliate
of FPL Energy, LLC to purchase all of the renewable energy from an approximately
50-MW  (nameplate)  wind facility to be built in North Dakota.  FPL Energy,  LLC
expects the facility to be  operational  in the fall of 2006.  The wind facility
will be comprised of 22 new 2.3 MW wind  turbines  interconnected  to the Square
Butte  substation in Center,  North Dakota,  near the BNI Coal mine. On December
20, 2005, the MPUC approved the power purchase agreement. In addition, Minnesota
Power is continuing  to pursue the purchase of renewable  energy from a new wind
facility that would be located in northern Minnesota.  The project,  expected to
be operational in 2007, would be similar in size to the North Dakota project and
would be subject to a power purchase agreement, as well as regulatory approvals.
The  Minnesota  project  also needs to be  operational  by the end of 2007 to be
eligible  for federal  production  tax credits  which are  essential  to provide
acceptable pricing.

FUEL

Minnesota Power purchases low-sulfur,  sub-bituminous coal from the Powder River
Basin coal field  located in  Montana.  Coal  consumption  in 2005 for  electric
generation at Minnesota  Power's  coal-fired  generating  stations was about 5.1
million tons. As of December 31, 2005,  Minnesota  Power had a coal inventory of
about  464,000  tons.  Minnesota  Power  has two  coal  supply  agreements  with
expiration dates extending  through 2009 and one contract  expiring December 31,
2006.  Under these  agreements,  Minnesota Power has the tonnage  flexibility to
procure 70% to 100% of its total coal  requirements.  In 2006,  Minnesota  Power
will obtain coal under these coal supply agreements and in the spot market. This
diversity in coal supply options allows  Minnesota  Power to manage market price
and supply risk and to take advantage of favorable spot market prices. Minnesota
Power is exploring future coal supply options. We believe that adequate supplies
of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal will continue to be available.

ENERGY - REGULATED UTILITY (CONTINUED)

In 2001,  Minnesota  Power and Burlington  Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company
(Burlington  Northern) entered into a long-term agreement under which Burlington
Northern  transports all of Minnesota Power's coal by unit train from the Powder
River  Basin  directly  to  Minnesota  Power's  generating  facilities  or  to a
designated interconnection point. Minnesota Power also has an agreement with the
Canadian National Railway and is negotiating a new agreement with Midwest Energy
Resources Company to transport coal from the Burlington Northern interconnection
point to certain Minnesota Power facilities.

The Square Butte  generating  unit operated by Minnkota Power burns North Dakota
lignite coal supplied by BNI Coal,  in  accordance  with the terms of a contract
expiring  in  2027.   Square   Butte's  cost  of  lignite  burned  in  2005  was
approximately  75 cents per MBtu. The lignite acreage that has been dedicated to
Square Butte by BNI Coal is located on lands  essentially all of which are under
private  control  and  presently  leased by BNI  Coal.  This  lignite  supply is
sufficient to provide the fuel for the anticipated useful life of the generating
unit.

REGULATORY ISSUES

We are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory  authorities.  The MPUC
has  regulatory  authority  over  Minnesota  Power's  service area in Minnesota,
retail rates,  retail  services,  issuance of securities and other matters.  The
FERC  has  jurisdiction  over  the  licensing  of  hydroelectric  projects,  the
establishment  of rates and charges for the sale of  electricity  for resale and
transmission of electricity in interstate  commerce,  and certain accounting and
record-keeping  practices.  The PSCW has  regulatory  authority  over the retail
sales of  electricity,  water  and gas by  SWL&P.  The  MPUC,  FERC and PSCW had
regulatory authority over 56%, 8% and 8%, respectively, of our 2005 consolidated
operating revenue.

ELECTRIC RATES.  Minnesota Power has historically  designed its electric service
rates based on cost of service  studies under which  allocations are made to the
various classes of customers. Nearly all retail sales include billing adjustment
clauses, which adjust electric service rates for changes in the cost of fuel and
purchased energy, and recovery of current and deferred conservation  improvement
program expenditures.

In  addition  to  Large  Power  Customer  contracts,  Minnesota  Power  also has
contracts with large industrial and commercial customers with monthly demands of
more than 2 MW but less  than 10 MW of  capacity.  The terms of these  contracts
vary depending  upon the  customer's  demand for power and the cost of extending
Minnesota Power's facilities to provide electric service.

Minnesota  Power requires that all large  industrial  and  commercial  customers
under contract  specify the date when power is first required.  Thereafter,  the
customer is generally  billed  monthly for at least the minimum  power for which
they contracted. These conditions are part of all contracts covering power to be
supplied  to new  large  industrial  and  commercial  customers  and to  current
customers as their contracts expire or are amended. All rates and other contract
terms are subject to approval by appropriate regulatory authorities.

FEDERAL  ENERGY  REGULATORY  COMMISSION.  The  FERC  has  jurisdiction  over our
wholesale  electric  service and  operations.  Minnesota  Power's  hydroelectric
facilities,  which are located in  Minnesota,  are  licensed  by the FERC.  (See
Environmental Matters - Water.)

On August 8, 2005,  President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005
(EPAct 2005), which repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005. PUHCA 2005 gives
FERC  certain  authority  over  books  and  records  of public  utility  holding
companies and their affiliates.  It also addresses FERC review and authorization
of the allocation of costs for non-power goods, or  administrative or management
services when  requested by a holding  company  system or state  commission.  In
addition,  EPAct  2005  directs  the  FERC to  issue  certain  rules  addressing
electricity reliability, investment in energy infrastructure, fuel diversity for
electric  generation,  and a promotion of energy efficiency and wise energy use.
The FERC is currently  in the process of  rulemakings  effectuating  EPAct 2005.
These include (among others):

   -   the implementation of long-term transmission rights;
   -   the  development  of electric  reliability  organizations  and  delegated
       authority to regional  entities for  proposing  and enforcing reliability
       standards;
   -   rules specifying the  form  for  applications  for  federal  construction
       permits to be issued in the exercise of federal backstop siting authority
       for transmission projects;
   -   establishment of rules requiring  unregulated  transmitting utilities  to
       provide open access to their transmission systems;
   -   the development  of  procedures for expeditious  consideration of  merger
       applications under the revised Federal Power Act Section 203;

ENERGY - REGULATED UTILITY (CONTINUED)

   -   the establishment of regional joint boards to consider economic dispatch;
   -   the  issuance  of rules necessary  for  FERC to  facilitate  transmission
       market transparency; and
   -   the manipulation of the energy market.

We continue to monitor FERC activity in these and other proceedings.

MUNICIPAL   CUSTOMERS.   Minnesota   Power  has  contracts   with  16  Minnesota
municipalities  receiving  wholesale electric service.  One contract,  currently
being renegotiated, expires March 1, 2006 (168,000 MWh purchased in 2005), while
the other 15 are for service through at least 2007, with the majority  extending
through at least 2010. In 2005, these municipal  customers purchased 756,000 MWh
from Minnesota Power.  Minnesota Power also has a contract for wholesale service
to Dahlberg Light & Power Company in Wisconsin.  Dahlberg  purchased 110,000 MWh
in 2005.

MIDWEST INDEPENDENT  TRANSMISSION SYSTEM OPERATOR, INC. (MISO).  Minnesota Power
and  SWL&P  are  members  of MISO.  MISO  was the  first  regional  transmission
organization  (RTO)  approved by FERC as meeting  its Order No.  2000  criteria.
Minnesota  Power and SWL&P  retain  ownership of their  respective  transmission
assets and control area functions,  but their transmission  network is under the
regional operational control of the MISO, and they take and provide transmission
service  under the MISO open access  transmission  tariff.  MISO  continues  its
efforts to standardize rates, terms and conditions of transmission  service over
the  broad  region  encompassing  all or parts  of 15  states  and one  Canadian
province, and over 100,000 MW of generating capacity.

Effective  April 1,  2005,  the  method  by which  Minnesota  Power  engages  in
wholesale  energy  transactions  changed,  with both  Minnesota  Power  load and
generation participating in MISO's day-ahead and real-time markets (MISO Day 2).
Generation also became subject to MISO economic dispatch authority.  As a result
of MISO Day 2 implementation,  energy transactions to serve retail customers are
sourced  by  wholesale  transactions  with  MISO as the  counterparty.  The MPUC
initially  denied  cost  recovery of certain  MISO Day 2 costs  through the fuel
clause in an order dated  December  21,  2005 (see  Minnesota  Public  Utilities
Commission  - Fuel Clause  Recovery of MISO Day 2 Costs  below).  As a result of
this  order,  the  Company  filed a Notice of Intent  to  Withdraw  from MISO in
December 2005 and is exploring  alternatives to MISO. Withdrawal from MISO would
also require MPUC and FERC approval.

MID-CONTINENT AREA POWER POOL (MAPP). Minnesota Power also participates in MAPP,
a power pool  operating in parts of eight states in the Upper Midwest and in two
provinces in Canada.  MAPP functions include a regional  transmission  committee
and a generation  reserve-sharing  pool. Minnesota Power is also a member of the
Midwest Reliability  Organization that was established as a regional reliability
council within the North  American  Electric  Reliability  Council on January 1,
2005.

MINNESOTA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION.  Minnesota Power's retail rates are based
on a 1994 MPUC  retail  rate  order that  allows  for an 11.6%  return on common
equity  dedicated to utility  plant.  Minnesota  Power does not expect to file a
request to increase  rates for its retail  utility  operations  during 2006.  We
will, however, continue to monitor the costs of serving our retail customers and
evaluate the need for a rate filing in the future.

INVESTIGATION  OF THE  USEFULNESS  OF THE FUEL  CLAUSE.  In June 2003,  the MPUC
initiated an investigation into the continuing  usefulness of the fuel clause as
a regulatory tool for electric utilities.  Minnesota Power's initial comments on
the proposed scope and procedure of the  investigation  were filed in July 2003.
The  investigation  will focus on whether  the fuel  clause  continues  to be an
appropriate  regulatory  tool.  The initial steps will be to review the clause's
original purpose,  structure and rationale  (including its current operation and
relevance  in today's  regulatory  environment),  and then  address  its ongoing
appropriateness  and  other  issues  if the need for  continued  use of the fuel
clause is shown. The MPUC has not taken action on any proposal and, as a result,
we are unable to predict the outcome or impact of this proceeding at this time.

FUEL CLAUSE RECOVERY OF MISO DAY 2 COSTS.  Minnesota Power filed a petition with
the MPUC in  February  2005 to amend its fuel  clause to  accommodate  costs and
revenue  related  to MISO Day 2. On April 7,  2005,  the MPUC  approved  interim
accounting  treatment of MISO Day 2 costs to be accounted for on a net basis and
recovered through the fuel clause, subject to refund with interest. This interim
treatment has continued while the MPUC has addressed the cost recovery petitions
from Xcel Energy Inc., Otter Tail Power Company,  Alliant Energy Corporation and
Minnesota Power.

On December 21, 2005, the MPUC issued an order which denied recovery through the
fuel  clause  of  uplift   charges,   congestion   revenue  and  expenses,   and
administrative  costs related to Minnesota Power's MISO Day 2 market activities.
Minnesota Power requested  rehearing of the order in a filing made with the MPUC
on January 10, 2006. The other three utilities  affected by the order also filed
for  rehearing,  as did the DOC and MISO. In a hearing on February 9, 2006,  the
MPUC  granted  rehearing  of the MISO  Day 2 docket  and  suspended  the  refund
obligation.  The MPUC will review the MISO Day 2 costs to determine  which costs
should be recovered on a current  basis  through the fuel clause and which costs
are more  appropriately  deferred for potential recovery through base rates. The
Company is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.

LARGE POWER CONTRACTS. On September 9, 2005, the MPUC approved Minnesota Power's
new electric service agreement with United States Steel Corporation for combined
service to the Minntac and  Keewatin  Taconite  facilities  through  October 31,
2013. On September 21, 2005,  Minnesota Power filed with the MPUC a petition for
approval  of its new  electric  service  agreement  with the Mittal  Steel USA -
Minorca  Mine that was  approved  by the MPUC on  November  15, 2005 for service
through December 31, 2012. On December 23, 2005,  Minnesota Power filed with the
MPUC a petition  for  approval of its new  electric  service  agreement  through
August 31, 2013, with Stora Enso's Duluth mills. On January 25, 2006,  Minnesota
Power filed with the MPUC a petition for  approval of its new  electric  service
agreement   through  February  28,  2010,  with  Blandin  Paper's  Grand  Rapids
facilities.

RESOURCE PLAN. In September 2004,  Minnesota Power filed our Integrated Resource
Plan  (Resource  Plan).  An October 2005 update to that plan  provided a revised
forecast that energy demand by customers in our service  territory will increase
at an  average  annual  rate  of 1.5% to  2019.  We  project  a load  growth  of
approximately 150 MW by 2010 with another 200 MW of growth  anticipated by 2015.
The forecasted  growth of 15 MW to 28 MW per year is primarily from  residential
and  smaller  commercial  expansion  and a positive  outlook  from  Large  Power
Customers in northeastern Minnesota,  such as taconite processing facilities and
paper mills.  Minnesota  Power also expects to realize a reduction in generating
resource supply over the next three years, under the terms of a long-term energy
supply  contract  with Square Butte.  The  combination  of increased  demand and
reduced supply means Minnesota Power will need to secure additional capacity and
energy to serve our customers in future years. In the Resource Plan, we provided
several options designed to meet the predicted growing demand in the region.

In October 2005,  Minnesota Power proposed to the MPUC a comprehensive  solution
to  meet  generation   needs  through  2010  that  includes  the  following  key
components:

   -   a transition of the Taconite Harbor generating facility from nonregulated
       energy  operations  to  regulated  utility  to  help  meet the  utility's
       forecasted base load energy requirements;
   -   a 50-MW long-term power  purchase  agreement  to  meet  near-term  energy
       needs; and
   -   various resource additions to help meet forecasted base load, support the
       expansion  of  renewable  generating  assets  and  help  meet Minnesota's
       Renewable Energy Objective that seeks a 10% supply of qualified renewable
       energy resources by 2015 for each Minnesota utility.

The  proposal to  transition  Taconite  Harbor to a regulated  utility  asset is
supported by the DOC and a group of our Large Power  Customers.  Minnesota Power
has received  approval of a power  purchase  agreement  for 50 MW of wind energy
purchased  from a wind  facility  in  North  Dakota.  Minnesota  Power  is  also
continuing  to pursue an agreement for an additional 50 MW of wind energy from a
new facility  being planned for  Minnesota,  and is proposing to obtain 10 MW of
additional   hydro   generation   through  an  expansion  of  the  Fond  du  Lac
hydroelectric station.

On November  16, 2005,  the MPUC issued a Notice of Comment  Period in Minnesota
Power's Resource Plan docket that requested information on how the Resource Plan
and the Arrowhead  Regional Emission  Abatement  proposal  (discussed below) are
affected by the  agreement  reached  between  Minnesota  Power,  the Large Power
Customer  group  and the DOC,  along  with  information  on how the MPUC  should
procedurally schedule the three identified items.  Minnesota Power filed initial
comments  in  response  to the Notice on  December  16,  2005,  and filed  reply
comments on January 11, 2006. Final regulatory approval of our Resource Plan and
the transition of Taconite Harbor is expected in mid 2006.

We are exploring various construction and purchase  options for our  anticipated
resource needs in 2015. These options include:

   -   NORTH  DAKOTA  GENERATION  STUDY. On  December 7, 2005, Minnesota  Power,
       Basin  Electric  Power  Cooperative,  Minnkota  Power and  Montana-Dakota
       Utilities Company announced a project  development  agreement to evaluate
       the  feasibility  of a joint  lignite-fueled  generating  resource in the
       vicinity of the existing Milton R. Young generating  station near Center,
       North Dakota. The feasibility  study,  which is underway,  is expected to
       take about one year to complete. Any final resource decision by Minnesota
       Power is subject to MPUC and other approvals.
   -   MESABA ENERGY PROJECT. Excelsior Energy Inc. (Excelsior) is a  Minnesota-
       based independent energy development  company.  Excelsior has proposed to
       construct  a  600  MW  (net)  coal-gasification  generation  facility  in
       northern Minnesota.  By utilizing new technology,  Excelsior says it will
       be able to provide base load electric  power supply with fewer  emissions
       than traditional coal-fired generation facilities. This project is in the
       early development  stages.  Excelsior has yet to obtain necessary permits
       and financing, but says the facility could be operational in 2011.

<PAGE>


ENERGY - REGULATED UTILITY (CONTINUED)

       In 2003,  the  Minnesota  legislature  enacted  several  provisions  that
       provide Excelsior with special  considerations.  This was done as part of
       Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s  (Xcel)   Prairie   Island   nuclear  waste  storage
       reauthorization.  Excelsior  is  "entitled"  to enter into a 450-MW power
       sales  agreement  with Xcel,  subject to MPUC  approval.  On December 23,
       2005,  Excelsior filed with the MPUC a petition for approval of terms and
       conditions  for  the  sale  of  power  to  Xcel  under  these   statutory
       provisions.  Other  utilities in the state,  including  Minnesota  Power,
       "must consider"  Excelsior before pursuing new resource  additions within
       the state.
       On January 30,  2006,  Minnesota  Power filed  comments  with the MPUC in
       Excelsior's  proposed power purchase agreement  proceeding.  Our comments
       focus on the  importance to the state of maintaining a range of base load
       energy options including multiple fuel types and generating technologies.
   -   NORTHEAST MINNESOTA FACILITY. A joint  study  with  Minnesota Power, Xcel
       and  another  utility is  underway  to  evaluate  the  environmental  and
       economic merits of an advanced design super critical pulverized coal unit
       in northeastern Minnesota.
   -   NATURAL GAS COMBINED CYCLE GENERATION. Minnesota Power is also continuing
       to study the  feasibility  of the  construction  of a  natural  gas-fired
       electric  generating  facility  which  could be located  in  northwestern
       Wisconsin or northeastern Minnesota.

ARROWHEAD  REGIONAL EMISSION  ABATEMENT (AREA) PLAN. In October 2005,  Minnesota
Power announced a $60 million  environmental  initiative  proposing current rate
recovery for emission  reductions  pursuant to Minnesota statute. If approved by
the MPUC,  the AREA plan is  expected to  significantly  reduce  emissions  from
Taconite  Harbor  and  Laskin.  The AREA  plan is  designed  to  further  reduce
emissions while  maintaining a reliable and  reasonably-priced  energy supply to
meet the needs of our customers. The Company believes that control and abatement
technologies  applicable to these plants have matured to the point where further
significant   air   emission   reductions   can  be  attained  in  a  relatively
cost-effective manner.

If approved,  Taconite Harbor will employ  innovative  multi-emission  reduction
technology,  while  Laskin  will  receive a  retrofit  focused on  lowering  NOX
emissions.  The Company  estimates an emission  reduction of over 60% for NOX at
both  facilities and a 65% reduction in SO2 at Taconite  Harbor.  Laskin already
has relatively  low emission  levels of SO2 due to existing  emission  reduction
technology. Additionally, with the emerging technology being applied at Taconite
Harbor, there is the potential for a 90% reduction in mercury.

On December 13, 2005, a second filing detailing the rate rider cost recovery for
the plan was submitted to the MPUC. The rate impact on  residential  and general
service  customers  is  expected  to be about 2%,  and about 3% for Large  Power
Customers when the plan is fully  implemented at the end of 2008. We are seeking
approval prior to June 30, 2006, when the statutory  authorization  for emission
reduction riders sunsets. On January 17, 2006, the MPCA submitted its assessment
of Minnesota  Power's AREA plan from an  environmental  perspective to the MPUC.
The MPCA supports the plan as a  cost-effective  means of reducing  emissions at
Taconite Harbor and Laskin.

CONSERVATION  IMPROVEMENT  PROGRAMS  (CIP).  Minnesota  requires  investor-owned
electric  utilities to spend a minimum of 1.5% of gross annual  retail  electric
revenue on CIP each year. These  investments are recovered from retail customers
through a billing adjustment and amounts included in retail base rates. The MPUC
allows utilities to accumulate,  in a deferred account for future recovery,  all
CIP expenditures,  as well as a carrying charge on the deferred account balance.
Minnesota  Power's CIP  investment  goal was $3.2 million for 2005 ($3.1 million
for 2004;  $2.9 million for 2003),  with actual spending of $3.6 million in 2005
($3.1 million in 2004; $5.0 million in 2003).

PUBLIC SERVICE  COMMISSION OF WISCONSIN.  SWL&P's current  electric retail rates
are based on a May 2005 PSCW retail  rate order that allows for an 11.7%  return
on common  equity and  resulted in an average  rate  increase of 3.9%.  In 2006,
SWL&P plans to file for an increase in rates to be  effective  beginning in 2007
for its electric, water and gas utility services.

In December  2003, the PSCW  unanimously  approved the revised $420 million cost
estimate for the  Wausau-to-Duluth  electric  transmission line. Minnesota Power
and  transmission  planners  throughout the region believe the 220-mile,  345-kV
transmission  line is necessary.  Minnesota Power has been actively  involved in
the  permitting.  Construction  activities in Minnesota  were completed in 2005.
Construction  commenced  in  Wisconsin  in August  2005,  and is scheduled to be
completed in June 2008.

ENERGY - REGULATED UTILITY (CONTINUED)

COMPETITION

We believe the overall impact of the EPAct 2005 on the electric utility industry
will  be  positive  and are  evaluating  the  effects  on our  business  as this
legislation is being implemented.  This federal legislation is designed to bring
more  certainty  to  energy  markets  that  ALLETE  participates  in, as well as
provides  investment  incentives for energy  efficiency,  energy  infrastructure
(such as electric  transmission  lines) and energy production.  The FERC has the
responsibility  of  implementing  numerous  new  standards  as a  result  of the
promulgation  of EPAct 2005. So far the FERC's  regulatory  efforts appear to be
generally positive for the utility industry.

EPAct 2005's repeal of the PUHCA 1935 should result in more capital flowing into
the industry while providing additional operational flexibility.  The PUHCA 1935
repeal may also  allow an  acceleration  of merger  activity,  although  that is
speculative and difficult to predict.

We  cannot  predict  the  timing  or  substance  of any  future  legislation  or
regulation.

FRANCHISES

Minnesota  Power  holds   franchises  to  construct  and  maintain  an  electric
distribution and  transmission  system in 90 cities and towns located within its
electric service territory. SWL&P holds similar franchises for electric, natural
gas and/or water  systems in 15 cities and towns  within its service  territory.
The  remaining  cities and towns  served do not require a  franchise  to operate
within their boundaries.  Our exclusive  service  territories are established by
state regulatory agencies.


ENERGY - NONREGULATED ENERGY OPERATIONS

BNI COAL owns and  operates  a  lignite  mine in North  Dakota.  BNI Coal is the
lowest-cost  supplier of lignite in North  Dakota,  producing  about 4.5 million
tons annually. Two electric generating  cooperatives,  Minnkota Power and Square
Butte, presently consume virtually all of BNI Coal's production of lignite under
cost-plus,  fixed fee, coal supply  agreements  expiring in 2027.  (See Fuel and
Note 10.) The mining process disturbs and reclaims  approximately  210 acres per
year.  Laws require that the reclaimed  land be at least as productive as it was
prior to mining. That means if the land we mine once grew crops, it must be able
to do so again after reclamation.  The cost to reclaim one acre of land averages
about $15,000 and can run as high as $30,000.  Reclamation costs are included in
the cost of coal.  In  September  2004,  BNI Coal  entered  into a master  lease
agreement with Farm Credit Leasing  Services  Corporation  (Farm Credit).  Under
this new  agreement,  BNI Coal  leases a dragline  that went into  operation  in
October 2004. BNI Coal is obligated to make lease payments totaling $2.8 million
annually for the 23-year lease term,  which expires in 2027.  BNI Coal will have
the  option  at the end of the lease  term to renew  the lease at a fair  market
rental,  to purchase the  dragline at fair market  value,  or to  surrender  the
dragline to Farm Credit and pay a $3.0  million  termination  fee.  With lignite
reserves of an estimated 600 million tons combined with new dragline  equipment,
BNI Coal has ample capacity to expand production.

NONREGULATED  GENERATION.  Nonregulated  generation  is primarily  non-rate base
generation sold at market-based rates to the wholesale market.

TACONITE  HARBOR.  In  2002,  we  commenced  operation  of the  Taconite  Harbor
generating  facilities,  which we purchased in 2001. The  generation  output was
primarily sold in the wholesale market and was sold in limited  circumstances to
Minnesota Power's retail utility customers.

In October 2005,  Minnesota Power proposed to the MPUC a comprehensive  solution
to meet generation needs through 2010 that includes  transitioning  the Taconite
Harbor generating facility from wholesale sales to retail sales to help meet the
utility's  forecasted  base load energy  requirements.  With MPUC approval,  our
proposal would make the  integration of Taconite  Harbor into Minnesota  Power's
regulated  utility  business  effective  retroactive  to January  1, 2006.  (See
Regulated Utility - Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.)

RAINY  RIVER  ENERGY has been  engaged in the  acquisition  and  development  of
nonregulated  generation and wholesale power marketing.  On April 1, 2005, Rainy
River Energy  completed the  assignment  of its power  purchase  agreement  with
LSP-Kendall  Energy,  LLC, the owner of an energy generation facility located in
Kendall County,  Illinois,  to  Constellation  Energy  Commodities.  Rainy River
Energy paid  Constellation  Energy Commodities $73 million in cash to assume the
power purchase  agreement,  which is in effect through  mid-September  2017. The
payment  resulted in a charge to our operating  income in the second  quarter of
2005.  The tax benefits of the payment  will be realized  through a capital loss
carryback  for federal  income tax  purposes  and have been  recorded as current
deferred  income tax assets.  The tax  benefits  are  expected to be realized in
2006.  In addition,  consent,  advisory  and closing  costs of $4.9 million were
incurred to complete the transaction.  As a result of this  transaction,  ALLETE
incurred a $77.9 million  ($50.4  million after tax, or $1.84 per diluted share)
charge in 2005.

ENERGY - NONREGULATED ENERGY OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

RAINY RIVER ENERGY CORPORATION - WISCONSIN continues to study the feasibility of
the  construction  of  a  natural  gas-fired  electric  generating  facility  in
northwestern  Wisconsin. In accordance with the PSCW's final order approving the
project,  Rainy River Energy Corporation - Wisconsin undertook  preliminary site
preparation work in late 2003.

In 2005,  we sold 1.5 million MWh of  nonregulated  generation  (1.5  million in
2004; 1.5 million in 2003).

ENERGY - INVESTMENT IN ATC

In December 2005, ALLETE entered into an agreement with Wisconsin Public Service
Corporation  and WPS  Investments,  LLC that  provides  for ALLETE,  through its
Wisconsin  subsidiary Rainy River Energy Corporation - Wisconsin,  to invest $60
million in ATC by the end of 2006. ATC is a Wisconsin-based  public utility that
owns and maintains electric transmission assets in parts of Wisconsin, Michigan,
Minnesota and Illinois.  ATC provides transmission service under rates regulated
by the FERC  that are set to  further  the  FERC's  policy of  establishing  the
independent   operation  and  ownership  of,  and  investment  in,  transmission
facilities.  ALLETE's  investment  is  expected to  represent  an  estimated  9%
ownership  interest in ATC.  The  investment  by ALLETE's  subsidiary  in ATC is
subject to review by the PSCW.  The FERC  approved the  transaction  in December
2005.

REAL ESTATE

ALLETE Properties is our real estate business that has operated in Florida since
1991. ALLETE Properties acquires real estate portfolios and large land tracts at
bulk prices, adds value through entitlements and/or infrastructure improvements,
and resells the  property  over time to  developers,  end-users  and  investors.
ALLETE  Properties is focused on acquiring vacant land in the coastal  southeast
United   States.   Management   at  ALLETE   Properties   uses  their   business
relationships,  understanding  of real estate  markets and expertise in the land
development   and  sales  processes  to  provide  revenue  and  earnings  growth
opportunities to ALLETE.

ALLETE Properties is headquartered in Fort Myers,  Florida,  the location of its
southwest Florida regional office. We also have a regional office in Palm Coast,
Florida, which oversees northeast Florida operations.

Southwest Florida operations  consist of land sales and a third-party  brokerage
business,   with  limited  land  development   activities.   Inventory  includes
commercial  and  residential  land located in Lehigh  Acres and Cape Coral.  The
inventory  represents  the  remaining  properties  acquired  in  1991  from  the
Resolution  Trust  Corporation  and in 1999 from  Avatar  Properties,  Inc.  The
operation  also  generates  rental  income  from a 186,000  square  foot  retail
shopping  center  located in Winter  Haven,  Florida.  The center is anchored by
Macy's and Belk's department stores, along with Staples.

Northeast  Florida  operations  focus on land sales and development  activities.
Development  activities involve mainly zoning,  permitting,  platting and master
infrastructure   construction.   Development   costs  are  financed   through  a
combination   of  community   development   district   bonds,   bank  loans  and
internally-generated  funds. Our three major  development  projects include Town
Center at Palm Coast, Palm Coast Park and Ormond Crossings.

TOWN  CENTER.   Town  Center  is  a  mixed-use,   planned   development  with  a
neo-traditional  downtown design.  Surrounded by major arterial roads, including
Interstate  95, the  development  was  selected as the site for the City of Palm
Coast's new city hall and is adjacent to the local hospital,  county airport and
high  school.  At  build-out,  the  development  is  expected  to include  2,800
residential  units and 3.6  million  square  feet of  commercial  space.  Actual
build-out will depend on future market conditions.  All major land use approvals
for the project have been received.  Platting,  infrastructure  construction and
marketing efforts continue.  The major  infrastructure  improvements include 3.6
miles of roads, a storm water  management  system,  with lakes and ponds located
throughout the property, and underground utilities.  Construction began in March
2005 and is expected to be completed in late 2006.

In March 2005,  the Town  Center at Palm Coast  Community  Development  District
(Town  Center  District)   issued  $26.4  million  of  tax-exempt,   6%  Capital
Improvement  Revenue Bonds,  Series 2005, due May 1, 2036. The bonds were issued
to fund a  portion  of the  Town  Center  at  Palm  Coast  development  project.
Approximately  $21 million of the bond proceeds will be used for construction of
infrastructure  improvements at Town Center, with the remaining funds to be used
for capitalized interest, a debt service reserve fund and costs of issuance. The
bonds are  payable  from and  secured by the revenue  derived  from  assessments
imposed,  levied and  collected  by the Town Center  District.  The  assessments
represent  an  allocation  of the  costs  of the  improvements,  including  bond
financing  costs, to the lands within the Town Center  District  benefiting from
the  improvements.  The assessments  will be included in the annual property tax
bills of landowners  beginning in November 2006. To the extent that we still own
land at the time of the  assessment,  we will  recognize  an expense for our pro
rata portion of assessments based upon our ownership of benefited  property.  At
December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 92% of the assessable land in the Town
Center District.

Additional Town Center development costs not funded through Town Center District
bond  financing,  estimated at  approximately  $26 million (up to $11 million of
which are  reimbursable  through  traffic impact fee credits),  will be financed
with an $8.5 million revolving  development loan of Florida  Landmark,  which is
guaranteed by Lehigh Acquisition Corporation. Florida Landmark is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Lehigh Acquisition  Corporation,  which is an 80% owned subsidiary
of ALLETE.  The initial  term of the  revolving  development  loan is 36 months.
Traffic impact fee credits are provided to the developer as mitigation  payments
are made to the city. We are reimbursed  after the land is sold and a subsequent
property  owner  constructs  vertical  improvements  on the site.  We  recognize
revenue resulting from these reimbursed fees when they are received.

The Town Center District is an independent unit of local government, created and
established in accordance with Florida's Uniform Community  Development District
Act of 1980 (Act). The Act provides legal authority for a community  development
district to finance  the  construction  of major  infrastructure  for  community
development with general obligation, revenue and special assessment revenue debt
obligations.

Florida Landmark has an agreement with Developers  Realty  Corporation  (DRC) to
develop the first phase of the urban core area of our Town Center. The agreement
also includes the  development  of a 51-acre  commercial  retail site.  DRC is a
regional  commercial  developer  with strong ties to national  retailers and has
experience developing "lifestyle center" projects.

During the initial  phase of the Town Center  project,  our primary  focus is to
develop the major  infrastructure,  most of the development  tracts,  as well as
plat  lots  for a  variety  of uses.  The  marketing  program  has  targeted  an
appropriate blend and quantity of office, commercial,  residential and mixed-use
projects.  Sites for all land uses that are  planned  in the  initial  phase are
already sold or under contract, except adult housing.  Negotiations are underway
with several  developers that

REAL ESTATE (CONTINUED)

specialize in adult housing units. After the next few years, once the market has
substantially  absorbed  the land uses that are  currently in the design  phase,
additional  sites  will be  released  for sale in order to  maintain  an orderly
build-out  of Town  Center.  Pacing the growth of Town  Center  consistent  with
absorption  rates for each unit type will  assure that our  customers,  the Town
Center project  developers,  will be successful.  This is expected to create and
maximize value for the developers, end-users and investors.

PALM COAST PARK. Palm Coast Park is a 4,700-acre mixed-use,  planned development
located  in  northwest  Palm Coast  along U.S.  Highway 1, one mile south of its
intersection with Interstate 95, with major rail line access. At build-out,  the
project is expected to include 3.2 million  square feet of commercial  space and
3,600 residential units ranging from affordable condominium units and apartments
to estate golf homes.  Actual build-out will depend on future market conditions.
In December 2004, we received development order approval for the project.

In August 2005,  Florida's governor and cabinet voted unanimously to approve the
creation of Palm Coast Park Community Development  District.  Bonds are expected
to be issued by the district by mid-2006 to fund  construction of infrastructure
improvements for the project. The major infrastructure improvements,  consisting
primarily  of utility  extensions  and a linear  park  along the U.S.  Highway 1
frontage,  are being permitted in  anticipation  of this bond  financing,  after
which construction of the improvements will commence.

Platting  is  underway  and is  expected  to be  completed  in early  2007.  One
residential development tract is under contract and negotiations are underway to
sell  two  other  residential  development  tracts.  Commercial  sites  will  be
available for sale beginning in 2007.

ORMOND  CROSSINGS.   Ormond  Crossings  is  a  6,000-acre   mixed-use,   planned
development located along Interstate 95, at its interchange with U.S. Highway 1,
in northwest Ormond Beach. This property has three miles of frontage on the east
and west sides of Interstate 95, is adjacent to the local airport and has access
to a major  railroad  line.  In 2004,  the property was annexed into the City of
Ormond Beach and land-use approvals are in progress.

A Development of Regional Impact (DRI) Application for Development  Approval was
submitted in August 2005 to the East Central Florida  Regional  Planning Council
for the project.  Development  uses and densities  proposed in the DRI include 5
million  square  feet  of  commercial  opportunities,  along  with  up to  4,400
residential units. We anticipate that the DRI approval process will be concluded
in late 2006, at which time we would  receive a Development  Order from the City
of Ormond Beach. Engineering,  design and permitting will continue through 2007.
It is not  anticipated  that any sales  will be made at Ormond  Crossings  until
2008.

OTHER LAND. In addition to the major development  projects,  land inventories in
Florida  include  4,200 acres of other  property.  Several  smaller  development
projects are under way to plat these properties,  add  infrastructure and modify
and enhance existing entitlements.

Property sale prices may vary depending on location;  physical  characteristics;
parcel size; whether parcels are sold as raw land,  partially  developed land or
individually  developed lots; degree and status of entitlement;  and whether the
land is  ultimately  purchased  for  residential,  commercial  or other  form of
development.  In addition to minimum  base price  contracts,  certain  contracts
allow us to receive  participation  revenue to the  extent  that an agreed  upon
percentage of gross revenue from land sales by our purchaser exceeds the minimum
base price.

ALLETE Properties  occasionally provides seller financing. At December 31, 2005,
outstanding finance receivables were $7.4 million, with maturities ranging up to
ten years.  These finance  receivables accrue interest at market-based rates and
are collateralized by the financed properties.

REAL ESTATE (CONTINUED)

REGULATION

A  substantial  portion of our  development  properties in Florida is subject to
federal,  state  and  local  regulations,   and  restrictions  that  may  impose
significant costs or limitations on our ability to develop the properties.  Much
of our  property is vacant  land and some is located in areas where  development
may affect the natural  habitats  of various  protected  wildlife  species or in
sensitive environmental areas such as wetlands.

Development of real property in Florida  entails an extensive  approval  process
involving  overlapping  regulatory  jurisdictions.  Real  estate  projects  must
generally  comply  with the  provisions  of the Local  Government  Comprehensive
Planning and Land  Development  Regulation Act (Growth  Management  Act),  which
requires  counties  and  cities  to  adopt   comprehensive   plans  guiding  and
controlling future real property development in their respective  jurisdictions.
In addition,  development  projects  that exceed  certain  specified  regulatory
thresholds  require  approval of a comprehensive  Development of Regional Impact
(DRI) application.  The DRI review process includes an evaluation of a project's
impact on the environment,  infrastructure and government services, and requires
the involvement of numerous state and local environmental,  zoning and community
development  agencies.  Compliance  with the Growth  Management  Act and the DRI
process is usually lengthy and costly.

COMPETITION

The real estate  industry is very  competitive.  Our  properties  are located in
Florida,  which continues to attract  competitive real estate operations at many
different levels in the land development pipeline. Competitors include local and
out-of-state  institutional  investors,  real estate  investment trusts and real
estate  operators,  among  others.  These  competitors,  both public and private
alike,  compete with us in seeking real estate for  acquisition,  resources  for
development and sales to prospective  buyers.  Consequently,  competitive market
conditions  may  influence  the  timing  and  profitability  of our real  estate
transactions.


OTHER

Our Other segment  consists of investments in emerging  technologies  related to
the electric  utility  industry,  and  earnings on cash,  cash  equivalents  and
short-term investments.

EMERGING TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO.  As part of our emerging technology portfolio, we
have  several   minority   investments  in  venture  capital  funds  and  direct
investments in privately-held,  start-up companies. Since 1985, we have invested
in start-up companies, which are developing technologies that may be utilized by
the electric  utility  industry.  We are committed to invest an additional  $3.1
million  at  various  times  through  2007  and do not  have  plans  to make any
additional  investments.  The  investments  were  first  made  through  emerging
technology funds (Funds)  initiated by other electric  utilities and us. We have
also made investments directly in privately-held companies.

Companies in the Funds' portfolios may complete IPOs, and the Funds may, in some
instances, distribute publicly tradable shares to us. Some restrictions on sales
may apply,  including,  but not limited to,  underwriter  lock-up  periods  that
typically  extend for 180 days  following an IPO. As  companies  included in our
emerging technology portfolio are sold, we will recognize a gain or a loss.

We account for our  investment in venture  capital funds under the equity method
(see Note 15) and account for our direct investment in privately-held  companies
under the cost method  because of our ownership  percentage.  The total carrying
value of our emerging technology portfolio was $9.2 million at December 31, 2005
($13.6 million at December 31, 2004). Our policy is to review these  investments
quarterly  for  impairment  by assessing  such  factors as continued  commercial
viability of products,  cash flow and earnings.  Any impairment would reduce the
carrying  value  of  the  investment.   Our  basis  in  direct   investments  in
privately-held  companies included in the emerging technology portfolio was zero
at December 31, 2005 ($4.5 million at December 31,  2004).  In 2005, we recorded
$5.1 million  ($3.3  million  after tax) of  impairments  that related to direct
investments in certain privately-held,  start-up companies whose future business
prospects  had  significantly   diminished.   Developments  at  these  companies
indicated that future  commercial  viability was unlikely,  as was new financing
necessary to continue  development.  In 2004,  we recorded  $6.5  million  ($4.1
million after tax) of impairments.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Our  businesses  are subject to regulation of  environmental  matters by various
federal,  state and local  authorities.  We  consider  our  businesses  to be in
substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable
to their operations and believe all necessary permits to conduct such operations
have been obtained.  Due to future stricter  environmental  requirements through
legislation  and/or  rulemaking,  we anticipate that potential  expenditures for
environmental  matters  will be material and will  require  significant  capital
investments.  (See Item 7 - Capital  Requirements.)  We are unable to predict if
and when any such stricter  environmental  requirements  will be imposed and the
impact  they will have on the  Company.  We review  environmental  matters  on a
quarterly  basis.  Accruals for  environmental  matters are recorded  when it is
probable  that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can
be reasonably estimated,  based on current law and existing technologies.  These
accruals  are  adjusted  periodically  as  assessment  and  remediation  efforts
progress or as  additional  technical or legal  information  becomes  available.
Accruals for  environmental  liabilities  are  included in the balance  sheet at
undiscounted  amounts and exclude claims for recoveries  from insurance or other
third  parties.  Costs  related to  environmental  contamination  treatment  and
cleanup are charged to expense unless recoverable in rates from customers.

AIR.  CLEAN  AIR  ACT.  Minnesota  Power's  generating  facilities  mainly  burn
low-sulfur western  sub-bituminous  coal. Square Butte, located in North Dakota,
burns lignite coal. All of these facilities are equipped with pollution  control
equipment  such  as  scrubbers,  bag  houses  or  electrostatic   precipitators.
Permitted  emission  requirements are currently being met. The federal Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act) created emission allowances for SO2. Each
allowance is an authorization to emit one ton of SO2, and each utility must have
sufficient  allowances  to cover its  annual  emissions.  Most  Minnesota  Power
facilities have surplus SO2 emission allowances. Square Butte is meeting its SO2
emission allowance  requirements through increased use of its existing scrubber.
During 2005,  Taconite  Harbor  purchased SO2 emission  allowances to meet these
requirements.   Taconite  Harbor  does  not  expect  to  purchase  SO2  emission
allowances in 2006 if the MPUC approves the transfer of its generating assets to
regulated utility operations retroactive to January 1, 2006.

In accordance  with the Clean Air Act, the EPA has  established  NOX limitations
for  electric  generating  units.  To  meet  NOX  limitations,  Minnesota  Power
installed  advanced   low-emission  burner  technology  and  associated  control
equipment  to  operate  the  Boswell  and  Laskin  facilities  at or  below  the
compliance  emission limits. NOX limitations at Taconite Harbor and Square Butte
are being met by combustion tuning.

CLEAN AIR  INTERSTATE  RULE AND CLEAN AIR MERCURY RULE.  In March 2005,  the EPA
announced  the  final  Clean  Air  Interstate   Rule  (CAIR)  that  reduces  and
permanently  caps emissions of SO2 and NOX in many of the eastern United States.
The CAIR  includes  Minnesota  as one of the 28 states it considers an "eastern"
state.  The EPA also  announced  the final  Clean Air  Mercury  Rule (CAMR) that
reduces  and  permanently  caps  electric  utility  mercury   emissions  in  the
continental  United  States.  The  CAIR  and  the  CAMR  regulations  have  been
challenged  in the  court  system,  which  may  delay  implementation  or modify
provisions.  Minnesota Power is  participating in a legal challenge to the CAIR,
but is not participating in the challenge of the CAMR.  However, if the CAMR and
the CAIR do go into effect,  Minnesota  Power expects to be required to (1) make
emissions  reductions,  (2) purchase mercury, SO2 and NOX allowances through the
EPA's cap-and-trade system, or (3) use a combination of both.

We believe that the CAIR  contains  flaws in its  methodology  and  application,
which will cause Minnesota Power to incur significantly higher compliance costs.
Consequently, on July 11, 2005, Minnesota Power filed a Petition for Review with
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Company also
filed a Petition for Reconsideration  with the EPA. If the litigation and/or the
Petition for Reconsideration are successful, we expect to incur lower compliance
costs,  consistent  with the rules  applicable  to those  states  considered  as
"western"  states  under the CAIR.  On  November  22,  2005,  the EPA  agreed to
reconsider  certain aspects of its CAIR,  including the Minnesota Power petition
addressing modeling used to determine  Minnesota's  inclusion in the CAIR region
and claims about inequities in the SO2 allowance methodology. The EPA has stated
it anticipates making a decision regarding the petitions in mid-March 2006.

MERCURY EMISSIONS.  In December 2000, the EPA announced its decision to regulate
mercury  emissions from coal and oil-fired power plants under Section 112 of the
Clean Air Act.  Section 112 would  require  all such power  plants in the United
States  to  adhere  to the EPA  maximum  achievable  control  technology  (MACT)
standards  for mercury.  However,  on March 15, 2005,  the EPA removed  electric
utilities  from the  Section  112(c) list of source  categories  subject to MACT
requirements, instead referencing how the EPA is regulating utility emissions of
mercury under Section 111 and how the EPA is providing  for  additional  SO2 and
NOX emission  reductions that will deliver mercury reductions as a co-benefit of
controls  under the March 10,  2005 final CAIR.  The EPA has  assigned a mercury
emission  budget to each state that is based on  achieving  an  approximate  70%
overall  reduction  in baseline  utility  mercury  emissions by the start of the
second  phase of the  CAMR in  2018.  The MPCA is now  required  to  provide  an
implementation  plan for EPA approval in 2006, by which time Minnesota will have
determined if it will  participate in the EPA's  proposed  mercury cap and trade
program.  The EPA's  determination not to list electric  utilities under Section
112(c) has already been  subjected to court  challenge.  The  Minnesota  mercury
emissions  budget  under  the  first  phase  of the  CAMR is  close  to  current
emissions.  The second  phase  allocation,  effective  2018,  will  require that
Minnesota sources provide for substantial mercury emission reductions or procure
mercury  emission  credits from other sources that have a surplus of allowances.
Continuous  emission  monitoring of mercury stack  emissions will be required on
larger  units while  smaller  units with low mercury  emissions  may not require
continuous  monitoring.  Minnesota Power is continuing to review the new mercury
rule and considers  the outcome of legal  challenges  as being  critical  before
specific compliance  measures can  be established or assessed. Minnesota Power's

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS (CONTINUED)

preliminary  estimates  suggest  that  all of  our  affected  facilities  can be
outfitted with continuous  mercury emission monitors for under $2 million.  Cost
estimates  about  mercury cap and trade  program  impacts are  premature at this
time.  In October  2005,  Minnesota  Power  announced  the AREA plan  which,  if
approved by the MPUC, includes installing multi-emission reduction technology at
Taconite  Harbor that has the  potential  for a 90%  reduction in mercury.  (See
Regulatory Issues - Minnesota Public Utilities  Commission - Arrowhead  Regional
Emission Abatement.)

NEW SOURCE  REVIEW  RULES.  In  December  2002,  the EPA  issued  changes to the
existing New Source Review rules.  These rules changed the  procedures  for MPCA
review of projects at our electric  generating  facilities.  These  changes have
been  incorporated  in  Minnesota  and have  not had a  material  impact  on our
operations. In October 2003, the EPA announced additional changes clarifying the
application  of certain  sections of the New Source  Review  rules.  In December
2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  Circuit stayed the
implementation  of the October 2003 rule pending their further review,  which is
expected in 2006.  These  changes are not expected to have a material  impact on
Minnesota Power.

SQUARE BUTTE GENERATING FACILITY.  In June 2002, Minnkota Power, the operator of
Square Butte,  received a Notice of Violation from the EPA regarding alleged New
Source Review  violations at the M.R. Young  Station,  which includes the Square
Butte  generating  unit. The EPA claims certain  capital  projects  completed by
Minnkota  Power  should have been  reviewed  pursuant  to the New Source  Review
regulations,  potentially  resulting in new air permit operating  conditions and
possible  significant  capital  expenditures to comply.  Minnkota Power has held
several  meetings  with the EPA to discuss the alleged  violations.  Discussions
between  Minnkota Power and the EPA are ongoing and we are unable to predict the
outcome or cost impacts. If Square Butte is required to make significant capital
expenditures  to  comply  with the EPA  requirements,  we  expect  such  capital
expenditures  to be debt  financed.  Our future  cost of  purchased  power would
include our pro rata share of this additional debt service.

GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE.  Minnesota Power recognizes the international  efforts to
study the science  and  economic  implications  of global  climate  change are a
work-in-progress.   While  the  international  forum  continues  its  study  and
negotiations to address the complexities of climate change  concerns,  Minnesota
Power believes it is appropriate to implement voluntary greenhouse gas emissions
reduction or offset  measures that are  consistent  with  peer-reviewed  climate
science,  provide a  continued  supply  of  competitive,  low-cost  power to our
customers,  and  continue  responsible  environmental  stewardship.  As of 2004,
Minnesota Power estimates that we offset the equivalent of over one million tons
of  carbon  dioxide  annually,  or  about  9% of the  greenhouse  gas  emissions
associated with the supply of electricity to its Minnesota retail customers.

Minnesota  Power  has been a  participant  along  with  other  utilities  in the
voluntary  U.S.  Department  of Energy's  Climate  Challenge  program  since its
inception in 1991.  The program is dedicated to the  development  of  innovative
programs  to reduce,  limit,  avoid or offset  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases.
Minnesota  Power also supports Power Partners,  a new voluntary  program that is
replacing the Climate Challenge program.

Minnesota Power is voluntarily  submitting annual reports to the U.S. Department
of  Energy  on  activities  outlined  in  Minnesota  Power's  Climate  Challenge
Participation  Accord.  Minnesota Power implemented measures that helped improve
the energy  efficiency of our  generation  and the energy used by our customers,
increased  our use of renewable  hydroelectric  generation,  wind and wood waste
fuel,  established a waste paper  recycling  facility that reduces the demand on
forest  resources and landfills and helped  establish a tree planting program in
Minnesota that will mediate  greenhouse gas emissions while providing  Minnesota
with another tool for good forestry management.

WATER.  The Federal  Water  Pollution  Control Act requires  National  Pollutant
Discharge  Elimination  System (NPDES)  permits to be obtained from the EPA (or,
when  delegated,  from  individual  state  pollution  control  agencies) for any
wastewater  discharged  into  navigable  waters.  We have obtained all necessary
NPDES permits, including NPDES storm water permits for applicable facilities, to
conduct our operations.

FERC LICENSES. Minnesota Power holds FERC licenses authorizing the ownership and
operation of seven  hydroelectric  generating  projects with a total  generating
capacity of about 115 MW. In June 1996,  Minnesota Power filed in the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the  District of  Columbia  Circuit a petition  for review of the
license  as issued by the FERC for  Minnesota  Power's  St.  Louis  River  Hydro
Project. Separate petitions for review were also filed by the U.S. Department of
the Interior  and the Fond du Lac Band of Lake  Superior  Chippewa  (Fond du Lac
Band), two intervenors in the licensing  proceedings.  The Fond du Lac Band, the
U.S.  Department of the Interior and  Minnesota  Power have reached a settlement
agreement  for the St.  Louis  River  Hydro  Project.  This  settlement  must be
approved by the FERC. In connection with such approval, the FERC would amend the
project license to reflect the conditions of the settlement agreement. Minnesota
Power submitted an application for amendment of the FERC license, based upon the
terms and conditions of the  settlement  agreement in November 2004. In addition
to a  one-time  retroactive  payment  of  approximately  $750,000,  the  Company
estimates that it will spend $100,000 to $250,000 per year for the use of tribal
lands, to fund fishery and natural resource enhancements by the Fond du Lac Band
and the  Minnesota  Department  of Natural  Resources,  and to conduct a mercury
study under the terms of the settlement. Beginning in 1996, and most recently in
February  2006,  Minnesota  Power filed requests with the FERC for extensions of
time to comply with certain plans and studies required by the license that might
conflict with the settlement agreement.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS (CONTINUED)

CLEAN WATER ACT - AQUATIC ORGANISMS. In July 2004, the EPA issued Section 316(b)
Phase II Rule of the  Clean  Water  Act to  ensure  that the  location,  design,
construction  and  capacity  of cooling  water  intake  structures  at  electric
generating  facilities  reflect  the best  technology  available  to reduce fish
mortality due to impingement  (being pinned against  screens or other parts of a
cooling water intake  structure) or entrainment  (being drawn into cooling water
systems and subjected to thermal,  physical or chemical stresses).  The new rule
for  fish  impingement  mortality  requirements  apply to the  Boswell,  Laskin,
Hibbard and Square Butte generating facilities.  The impingement and entrainment
requirements  apply to Taconite  Harbor  because it is located on Lake Superior.
The rule requires  biological  studies and engineering  analyses to be performed
within the 2005 to 2008  timeframe.  The  biological  studies were  initiated in
2005.  The estimated  total cost of these studies for our facilities is expected
to be in the range of $0.5  million to $1.0  million.  At this  time,  we cannot
estimate  the  capital  and/or  aquatic  restoration  expenditures  that  may be
required to comply with the Section 316(b) Phase II Rule.

SOLID AND HAZARDOUS  WASTE.  The Resource  Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976
regulates the management and disposal of solid wastes and hazardous wastes. As a
result of this  legislation,  the EPA has  promulgated  various  hazardous waste
rules.  We are  required  to notify the EPA of  hazardous  waste  activity  and,
consequently,   routinely  submit  the  necessary  reports  to  the  EPA.  State
environmental  agencies are  responsible for  administering  solid and hazardous
waste  rules on the local  level with  oversight  by the EPA. We are in material
compliance with these rules.

PCB  INVENTORIES.  In response to the EPA Region V's  request for  utilities  to
participate  in the Great Lakes  Initiative by  voluntarily  removing  remaining
polychlorinated  biphenyl  (PCB)  inventories,   Minnesota  Power  replaced  its
remaining PCB capacitor banks in 2005. It is expected that  PCB-contaminated oil
in substation  equipment will be largely  replaced by the end of 2006. The total
cost is expected to be about $2 million, of which $1.6 million was spent through
December 31, 2005.

SWL&P  MANUFACTURED  GAS PLANT. In May 2001, SWL&P received notice from the WDNR
that the City of Superior had found soil  contamination on property  adjoining a
former  Manufactured  Gas Plant (MGP) site owned and operated by SWL&P from 1889
to 1904. The WDNR requested  SWL&P to initiate an  environmental  investigation.
The WDNR also issued  SWL&P a  Responsible  Party  letter in February  2002.  In
February  2003,  SWL&P  submitted a Phase II  environmental  site  investigation
report to the WDNR.  This report  identified  some MGP-like  chemicals that were
found in the soil near the  former  plant  site.  During  March and April  2003,
sediment  samples were taken from nearby Superior Bay. The report on the results
of this  sampling was completed and sent to the WDNR during the first quarter of
2004. The next phase of the investigation was to determine any impact to soil or
ground water  between the former MGP site and Superior  Bay.  Site work for this
phase of the  investigation  was performed  during  October 2004,  and the final
report was sent to the WDNR in March 2005.  Additional  site  investigation  was
performed  during  September and October 2005. It is anticipated that additional
site work will be performed in 2006. Although it is not possible to quantify the
potential  clean-up cost until the  investigation  is completed,  a $0.5 million
liability  was  recorded  in  December  2003  to  address  the  known  areas  of
contamination.  The  Company has  recorded a  corresponding  dollar  amount as a
regulatory  asset to  offset  this  liability.  The PSCW  has  approved  SWL&P's
deferral of these MGP environmental  investigation and potential  clean-up costs
for future recovery in rates,  subject to a regulatory  prudency review.  In May
2005,  the PSCW  approved  the  collection  through  rates of  $150,000  of site
investigation  costs that had been  incurred  at the time SWL&P filed their most
recent rate request.  ALLETE maintains  pollution  liability  insurance coverage
that  includes  coverage for SWL&P.  A claim has been filed with respect to this
matter.  The insurance carrier has issued a reservation of rights letter and the
Company  continues to work with the insurer to  determine  the  availability  of
insurance coverage.


EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2005, ALLETE had 1,500 employees, of which 1,400 were full-time.

Minnesota   Power  and  SWL&P  have  597   employees  who  are  members  of  the
International  Brotherhood  of Electrical  Workers  (IBEW),  Local 31. The labor
agreements with Local 31 expired on January 31, 2006, and a tentative  agreement
has been  reached.  The  members  of IBEW Local 31 are  expected  to vote on the
tentative agreement by the end of February 2006.

BNI Coal has 94 employees  who are members of the IBEW Local 1593.  BNI Coal and
Local 1593 have a labor agreement, which expires on March 31, 2008.

ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS

Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements, including those contained
in this Form 10-K,  should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the
heading:  "Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities  Litigation Reform
Act of 1995"  located  on page 3 of this  Form  10-K and the  factors  described
below. The risks and uncertainties  described in this Form 10-K are not the only
ones facing our  Company.  Additional  risks and  uncertainties  that we are not
presently aware of, or that we currently  consider  immaterial,  may also affect
our  business  operations.  Our  business,  financial  condition  or  results of
operations could suffer if the concerns set forth below are realized.

OUR  RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS  COULD BE  NEGATIVELY  IMPACTED  IF OUR LARGE  POWER
CUSTOMERS  EXPERIENCE AN ECONOMIC DOWN CYCLE OR FAIL TO COMPETE  EFFECTIVELY  IN
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

Our 12  Large  Power  Customers  account  for  approximately  32%  of  our  2005
consolidated  operating  revenue (one of these customers alone accounts for more
than 11%).  These  customers are involved in cyclical  industries that by nature
are  adversely  impacted  by  economic  downturns  and  are  subject  to  strong
competition  in the  global  marketplace.  An  economic  downturn  or failure to
compete  effectively in the global economy could have a material  adverse effect
on their operations and,  consequently,  could negatively  impact our results of
operations and the communities that we serve.

OUR ENERGY BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO INCREASED COMPETITION.

The independent power industry includes numerous strong and capable competitors,
many of which  have  extensive  experience  in the  operation,  acquisition  and
development of power generation  facilities.  Our competition is based primarily
on price and  reputation  for  quality,  safety and  reliability.  The  electric
utility and natural gas industries are also experiencing  increased  competitive
pressures as a result of consumer demands, technological advances,  deregulation
and other factors.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO  EXTENSIVE  GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT MAY HAVE A  NEGATIVE
IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

We are subject to  prevailing  governmental  policies  and  regulatory  actions,
including those of the United States Congress, state legislatures, the FERC, the
MPUC,  the  FPSC,  the  PSCW,  various  local and  county  regulators,  and city
administrators.  These  governmental  regulations  relate  to  allowed  rates of
return,  financings,  industry and rate  structure,  acquisition and disposal of
assets and facilities,  real estate  development,  operation and construction of
plant  facilities,  recovery of  purchased  power and capital  investments,  and
present or  prospective  wholesale  and retail  competition  (including  but not
limited to transmission  costs).  These governmental  regulations  significantly
influence our operating  environment and may affect our ability to recover costs
from our  customers.  We are required to have  numerous  permits,  approvals and
certificates  from the  agencies  that  regulate  our  business.  We believe the
necessary  permits,  approvals and certificates  have been obtained for existing
operations  and that our  business is conducted in  accordance  with  applicable
laws; however, we are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from
the  future  regulatory  activities  of  any  of  these  agencies.   Changes  in
regulations  or the imposition of additional  regulations  could have an adverse
impact on our results of operations.

OUR  REGULATED   UTILITY  AND  NONREGULATED   ENERGY   OPERATIONS  POSE  CERTAIN
ENVIRONMENTAL  RISKS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY  AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION.

We are subject to extensive  environmental  laws and regulations  affecting many
aspects of our present  and future  operations,  including  air  quality,  water
quality, waste management,  reclamation and other environmental  considerations.
These laws and regulations can result in increased capital,  operating and other
costs,  as a result  of  compliance,  remediation,  containment  and  monitoring
obligations, particularly with regard to laws relating to power plant emissions.
These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide
variety of  environmental  licenses,  permits,  inspections and other approvals.
Both public  officials and private  individuals  may seek to enforce  applicable
environmental  laws  and  regulations.   We  cannot  predict  the  financial  or
operational outcome of any related litigation that may arise.

There are no assurances  that  existing  environmental  regulations  will not be
revised or that new regulations  seeking to protect the environment  will not be
adopted or become  applicable to us.  Revised or additional  regulations,  which
result in  increased  compliance  costs or  additional  operating  restrictions,
particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from customers, could have
a material effect on our results of operations.

We cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of all future expenditures
related to  environmental  matters  because of the difficulty of estimating such
costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying  liabilities under environmental
laws that impose  joint and several  liability  on all  potentially  responsible
parties. (See Note 10.)

<PAGE>


RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)

THE OPERATION AND  MAINTENANCE OF OUR GENERATING  FACILITIES  INVOLVE RISKS THAT
COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS.

The operation of generating  facilities involves many risks,  including start-up
risks,  breakdown or failure of  facilities,  the  dependence on a specific fuel
source, or the impact of unusual or adverse weather  conditions or other natural
events,  as well as the risk of performance  below expected  levels of output or
efficiency,  the  occurrence  of any of  which  could  result  in lost  revenue,
increased  expenses  or  both.  A  significant   portion  of  Minnesota  Power's
facilities  was  constructed  many years ago. In  particular,  older  generating
equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may
require significant  capital  expenditures to keep operating at peak efficiency.
This  equipment is also likely to require  periodic  upgrading and  improvement.
(See Item I - Environmental Matters).  Minnesota Power could be subject to costs
associated  with any  unexpected  failure to produce  power,  including  failure
caused by breakdown or forced outage,  as well as repairing damage to facilities
due to storms,  natural disasters,  wars,  terrorist acts and other catastrophic
events.  Further,  our  ability  to  successfully  and timely  complete  capital
improvements to existing facilities or other capital projects is contingent upon
many  variables  and subject to  substantial  risks.  Should any such efforts be
unsuccessful,  we could be subject to  additional  costs and/or the write-off of
our investment in the project or improvement.

WE MUST HAVE ADEQUATE AND RELIABLE  TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION  FACILITIES TO
DELIVER ELECTRICITY TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

Minnesota Power depends on transmission  and  distribution  facilities owned and
operated by other utilities, as well as its own such facilities,  to deliver the
electricity  it  produces  and  sells  to its  customers,  and to  other  energy
suppliers.  If  transmission  capacity  is  inadequate,  our ability to sell and
deliver  electricity may be hindered,  we may have to forgo sales or we may have
to  buy  more  expensive   wholesale   electricity  that  is  available  in  the
capacity-constrained  area. The cost to provide  service to these  customers may
exceed the cost to serve other customers,  resulting in lower gross margins.  In
addition,  any  infrastructure  failure that  interrupts or impairs  delivery of
electricity to our customers  could  negatively  impact the  satisfaction of our
customers with our service.

THE PRICE OF ONE OF OUR MAJOR  PRODUCTS,  ELECTRICITY,  AND/OR  ONE OF OUR MAJOR
EXPENSES, FUEL, MAY BE VOLATILE.

Volatility in market prices for electricity and fuel may result from:

   -   severe or unexpected weather conditions;
   -   seasonality;
   -   changes in electricity usage;
   -   transmission   or    transportation    constraints,    inoperability   or
       inefficiencies;
   -   availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources;
   -   changes in supply and demand for energy commodities;
   -   changes in power production capacity;
   -   outages  at  Minnesota  Power's  generating  facilities  or  those of our
       competitors;
   -   changes in production and  storage levels of natural gas, lignite,  coal,
       or crude oil and refined products;
   -   natural disasters, wars, sabotage, terrorist  acts or other  catastrophic
       events; and
   -   federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  energy,  environmental,  or  other
       regulation and legislation.

Since  fluctuations in fuel expense related to our regulated utility  operations
are passed on to customers through our fuel clause, risk of volatility in market
prices for fuel and electricity  mainly impacts our  nonregulated  operations at
this time.

WE ARE DEPENDENT ON GOOD LABOR RELATIONS.

We believe our  relations  to be good with our  approximately  1,500  employees.
Approximately  700 of these  employees  are members of either the  International
Brotherhood  of  Electrical   Workers  Local  31  or  Local  1593.   Failure  to
successfully renegotiate labor agreements could adversely affect the services we
provide  and our  results  of  operations.  The labor  agreements  with Local 31
expired on January 31, 2006,  and a tentative  agreement has been  reached.  The
members of IBEW Local 31 are expected to vote on the tentative  agreement by the
end of February 2006. The labor agreement with Local 1593 at BNI Coal expires on
March 31, 2008.

A  DOWNTURN  IN  ECONOMIC CONDITIONS  COULD  ADVERSELY  AFFECT  OUR  REAL ESTATE
BUSINESS.

The ability of our real estate business to generate  revenue is directly related
to the Florida real estate  market,  the national and local  economy in general,
and changes in interest rates. While real estate market conditions have remained
healthy in our regions of development, continued demand for land is dependent on
long-term prospects for strong, in-migration population expansion.

RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)

WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT.

Our real estate  development  activities entail risks that include  construction
delays or cost overruns, which may increase project development costs.

In addition,  our real estate development activities require significant capital
expenditures.  We obtain  funds for our capital  expenditures  through cash flow
from operations and financings.  We cannot be sure that the funds available from
these  sources  will be  sufficient  to fund our  required  or  desired  capital
expenditures for development.  If we are unable to obtain  sufficient  funds, we
may have to defer or  otherwise  limit  our  development  activities.  If we are
unsuccessful in our selling efforts, we may not be able to recover these capital
expenditures.

OUR REAL ESTATE  BUSINESS  IS SUBJECT TO  EXTENSIVE  REGULATION,  WHICH MAKES IT
DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE FOR US TO CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS.

Development of real property in Florida  entails an extensive  approval  process
involving  overlapping  regulatory  jurisdictions.  Real  estate  projects  must
generally  comply  with the  provisions  of the Local  Government  Comprehensive
Planning  and Land  Development  Regulation  Act  (Growth  Management  Act).  In
addition,   development   projects  that  exceed  certain  specified  regulatory
thresholds  require  approval of a comprehensive  Development of Regional Impact
(DRI) application.

The Growth  Management Act requires  counties and cities to adopt  comprehensive
plans  guiding  and  controlling  future  real  property  development  in  their
respective  jurisdictions.  After a local  government  adopts its  comprehensive
plan, all development orders and development permits must be consistent with the
plan.  Each  plan  must  address  such  topics  as  future  land  use,   capital
improvements,  traffic circulation,  sanitation, sewage, potable water, drainage
and solid waste disposal.  The local governments'  comprehensive plans must also
establish   "levels  of  service"  with  respect  to  certain  specified  public
facilities and services to residents.  Local  governments  are  prohibited  from
issuing  development  orders or  permits  if  facilities  and  services  are not
operating at established levels of service, or if the projects for which permits
are requested will reduce the level of service for public  facilities  below the
level of service  established in the local government's  comprehensive  plan. If
the proposed  development  would reduce the established  level of services below
the level set by the plan,  the  development  order will  require  that,  at the
outset of the project, the developer either sufficiently improve the services to
meet the required  level or provide  financial  assurances  that the  additional
services will be provided as the project progresses.

The Growth  Management  Act, in some  instances,  can  significantly  affect the
ability of developers to obtain local  government  approval in Florida.  In many
areas,  infrastructure  funding  has not kept  pace  with  growth.  As a result,
substandard  facilities  and  services  can delay or  prevent  the  issuance  of
permits.  Consequently,  the Growth  Management Act could  adversely  affect our
ability to develop our future real estate projects.

The DRI review  process  includes an  evaluation  of a  project's  impact on the
environment,   infrastructure   and  government   services,   and  requires  the
involvement  of numerous  state and local  environmental,  zoning and  community
development agencies.  Local government approval of any DRI is subject to appeal
to the Governor and Cabinet by the Florida Department of Community Affairs,  and
adverse decisions by the Governor or Cabinet are subject to judicial appeal. The
DRI approval process is usually lengthy and costly, and conditions, standards or
requirements may be imposed on a developer with respect to a particular project,
which may materially increase the cost of the project.

ENVIRONMENTAL  AND  OTHER REGULATIONS  MAY HAVE  AN  ADVERSE  EFFECT ON OUR REAL
ESTATE BUSINESS.

A  substantial  portion of our  development  properties in Florida is subject to
federal,   state,  and  local  regulations  and  restrictions  that  may  impose
significant costs or limitations on our ability to develop our properties.  Much
of our  property is vacant  land and some is located in areas where  development
may affect the natural  habitats  of various  protected  wildlife  species or in
sensitive environmental areas such as wetlands.

THE  OCCURRENCE  OF NATURAL  DISASTERS  IN FLORIDA  COULD  ADVERSELY  AFFECT OUR
BUSINESS.

The  occurrence of natural  disasters in Florida,  such as  hurricanes,  floods,
fires,  unusually  heavy or prolonged  rain or  droughts,  could have a material
adverse  effect on our ability to develop and sell  properties or realize income
from our  projects.  The  occurrence  of  natural  disasters  could  also  cause
increases in property insurance rates and deductibles, which could reduce demand
or selling price for our properties.

RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH  ACQUISITIONS MAY  HINDER OUR  ABILITY TO INCREASE REVENUE
AND EARNINGS.

In pursuing a strategy of acquiring  other  businesses,  we face risks  commonly
encountered with growth through  acquisitions.  These risks include, but are not
limited to:

   -   incurring   significantly   higher  capital  expenditures  and  operating
       expenses;
   -   failing to assimilate  the  operations  and  personnel  of  the  acquired
       businesses;
   -   entering new, unfamiliar markets;
   -   potential undiscovered liabilities at acquired businesses;
   -   disrupting our ongoing business;
   -   diverting our limited management resources;
   -   failing to maintain uniform standards, controls and policies;
   -   impairing  relationships  with  employees  and  customers  as a result of
       changes in management; and
   -   increasing expenses for support services and computer systems, as well as
       integration difficulties.

We may not adequately  anticipate all of the demands that our growth will impose
on our systems, procedures and structures, including our financial and reporting
control systems, data processing systems and management structure.  If we cannot
adequately  anticipate  and  respond to these  demands,  our  business  could be
materially harmed.

Although  we  conduct  what we believe  to be a prudent  level of  investigation
regarding the operating condition of the businesses we purchase, in light of the
circumstances  of  each  transaction,  an  unavoidable  level  of  risk  remains
regarding the actual operating condition of these businesses.  Until we actually
assume  operating  control  of  such  business  assets,  we may  not be  able to
ascertain the actual value of the acquired entity.

WE CAN  OFFER YOU  NO ASSURANCES THAT WE  WILL BE ABLE TO EXECUTE AN ACQUISITION
STRATEGY WITHOUT THE COSTS OF FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ESCALATING.

Although there are potential  acquisition  candidates  that fit our  acquisition
criteria,  we are not  certain  that we will  be  able to  consummate  any  such
transactions in the future or identify those candidates that would result in the
most successful  combinations,  or that future  acquisitions  will be able to be
consummated at acceptable prices and terms. In addition,  increased  competition
for acquisition  candidates could result in fewer acquisition  opportunities for
us and higher acquisition prices. The magnitude,  timing,  pricing and nature of
future acquisitions will depend upon various factors, including:

   -   the availability of suitable acquisition candidates;
   -   competition with other industry groups or new  industry consolidators for
       suitable acquisitions;
   -   the negotiation of acceptable terms;
   -   our financial capabilities;
   -   the availability of skilled employees to  manage the acquired  companies;
       and
   -   general economic and business conditions.

OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD BE REVISED DOWNWARD.

The current credit ratings for our long-term debt are investment grade. A rating
reflects only the view of a rating  agency,  and it is not a  recommendation  to
buy, sell or hold  securities.  Any rating can be revised  upward or downward at
any time by a rating  agency if such rating  agency  decides that  circumstances
warrant such a change.  If Standard & Poor's or Moody's  were to  downgrade  our
long-term ratings,  particularly  below investment grade,  borrowing costs would
increase and the potential  pool of investors  and funding  sources would likely
decrease.

WE RELY HEAVILY ON TECHNOLOGY TO AUTOMATE AND MAXIMIZE THE  EFFICIENCIES  OF OUR
BUSINESSES AND TO COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER. TECHNOLOGY
IS  CONSTANTLY  EVOLVING  AND,  IN ORDER FOR US TO REMAIN  COMPETITIVE,  WE WILL
EMBRACE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AS THEY BECOME PROVEN AND ARE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE.

Technology is an integral part of the operating and administrative  functions of
our  businesses.  The  information  systems and  processes  necessary to support
business areas such as risk management, sales, customer service, and procurement
and supply are complex and are constantly  evolving.  To successfully compete in
our businesses,  we must adapt to the evolving  market by continually  improving
the responsiveness,  functionality,  and features of our services and systems to
meet our customers' and other  stakeholders'  needs. With increasing  regulatory
requirements  related to our  operations,  technology is also a key component to
achieving  and  monitoring  compliance.  Increased  automation  through  proven,
economically  viable  technologies  is among the  primary  tools  that we use to
enhance our competitive  position;  without these  technologies,  our businesses
would not be able to safely operate or adequately  respond to customer and other
stakeholder needs.

<PAGE>


RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)

TAX  RESERVES  AND THE  RECOVERABILITY OF  OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS  MAY  HAVE  A
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

We are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various
financial transactions and our ongoing operations to estimate our obligations to
taxing  authorities.  These tax obligations  include income, real estate and use
taxes. These judgments include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding
tax  positions  that we have taken.  We must also assess our ability to generate
capital gains to realize tax benefits associated with capital losses expected to
be  generated  in future  periods.  Capital  losses may be deducted  only to the
extent of capital gains realized during the year of the loss or during the three
prior or five  succeeding  years for federal  purposes,  and fifteen  succeeding
years for  Minnesota.  As of December  31,  2005,  we have,  where  appropriate,
recorded an allowance  against our deferred tax assets  associated with realized
capital  losses,  and with impairment  losses,  which will become capital losses
when  realized for income tax  purposes.  The  ultimate  outcome of such matters
could result in adjustments to our  consolidated  financial  statements and such
adjustments could be material.

ADEQUATE INSURANCE PROTECTION MAY NOT BE COST EFFECTIVE OR AVAILABLE TO MINIMIZE
RISK.

Insurance,  warranties or performance guarantees may not cover any or all of the
lost revenue or increased  expenses,  including the cost of  replacement  power.
Likewise, our ability to obtain insurance, and the cost of and coverage provided
by such insurance, could be affected by events outside our control.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RETAIN OUR EXECUTIVE  OFFICERS AND KEY  EMPLOYEES,  WE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER.

The success of our business  heavily  depends on the leadership of our executive
officers,  all of whom are employees-at-will and none of whom are subject to any
agreements  not to  compete.  If we  lose  the  service  of one or  more  of our
executive officers or key employees, or if one or more of them decides to join a
competitor or otherwise  compete  directly or indirectly  with us, we may not be
able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives.  We
may have  difficulty  in retaining  and  attracting  customers,  developing  new
services,   negotiating   favorable  agreements  with  customers  and  providing
acceptable levels of customer service.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO REPLACE OUR MATURE WORKFORCE WITH QUALIFIED PERSONNEL,  WE
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OPERATE  AND  MAINTAIN  OUR  BUSINESS  AND THE RESULTS OF OUR
OPERATIONS WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

The success of our business also depends on our talented workforce that operates
and maintains our business and processes. If we are unable to attract and retain
new  personnel  to  replace  our  mature  workforce,  we  may  not  be  able  to
successfully operate and manage our business or achieve our business objectives.
We  may  have  difficulty  effectively  and  efficiently  running  our  business
operations,  maintaining  existing services,  meeting  regulatory  requirements,
developing new services and providing acceptable levels of customer service.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Material legal and regulatory  proceedings are included in the discussion of our
business in Item 1 and are incorporated by reference herein.

We are involved in litigation arising in the normal course of business.  Also in
the normal  course of  business,  we are involved in tax,  regulatory  and other
governmental  audits,  inspections,  investigations  and other  proceedings that
involve state and federal taxes, safety, compliance with regulations,  rate base
and cost of service  issues,  among other things.  While the  resolution of such
matters  could have a material  effect on earnings and cash flows in the year of
resolution,  none of these matters are expected to materially change our present
liquidity  position,  nor  have a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  financial
condition.


ITEM 4.    SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

                                     PART II

ITEM 5.    MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON  EQUITY, RELATED  STOCKHOLDER  MATTERS
           AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

We have paid dividends  without  interruption  on our common stock since 1948. A
quarterly  dividend  of $0.3625  per share on our  common  stock will be paid on
March 1, 2006,  to the holders of record on February 15, 2006.  Our common stock
is listed on the New York  Stock  Exchange  under the  symbol  ALE and our CUSIP
number is 018522300.  Dividends paid per share,  and the high and low prices for
our common  stock for the  periods  indicated  as reported by the New York Stock
Exchange on its NYSEnet website, are in the accompanying chart.

The amount and timing of  dividends  payable on our common  stock are within the
sole discretion of our Board of Directors.  In 2005, we paid out 259% of our per
share  earnings in  dividends.  The payout ratio in 2005 was impacted by a $1.84
per diluted share charge to assign the Kendall County power  purchase  agreement
to Constellation Energy Commodities in April 2005. (See Note 11.)

Our  Articles  of  Incorporation,   and  Mortgage  and  Deed  of  Trust  contain
provisions,  which under  certain  circumstances  would  restrict the payment of
common  stock  dividends.  As of December 31, 2005,  no retained  earnings  were
restricted  as a result of these  provisions.  At February  1, 2006,  there were
approximately 32,000 common stock shareholders of record.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In 2005, ALLETE's operations were comprised of four business segments. REGULATED
UTILITY  includes retail and wholesale  rate-regulated  electric,  water and gas
services  in  northeastern   Minnesota  and  northwestern  Wisconsin  under  the
jurisdiction of state and federal regulatory  authorities.  NONREGULATED  ENERGY
OPERATIONS  includes our coal mining activities in North Dakota and nonregulated
generation (non-rate base generation sold at market-based rates to the wholesale
market)  primarily  from  Taconite  Harbor in northern  Minnesota.  Nonregulated
Energy  Operations also included  generation  secured through the Kendall County
power purchase agreement, which was assigned to Constellation Energy Commodities
in April 2005.  REAL ESTATE includes our Florida real estate  operations.  OTHER
includes our  investments in emerging  technologies,  and earnings on cash, cash
equivalents and short-term  investments.  DISCONTINUED  OPERATIONS  includes our
Automotive  Services  business,  costs  incurred by ALLETE  associated  with the
spin-off of ADESA,  our Water  Services  businesses  and our  telecommunications
business.

In 2005,  ALLETE was successful  both  financially  and  operationally  with our
utility power sales higher across all customer  classes and robust  Florida real
estate sales. We also achieved a number of milestones and accomplished important
strategic objectives, which included:

   -   Assigning the Kendall  County power purchase  agreement to  Constellation
       Energy Commodities, which eliminated projected after-tax operating losses

In 2005,  we began  allocating  corporate  charges and  interest  expense to our
business segments.  For comparative  purposes,  segment information for 2004 and
2003 has been  restated  to reflect the new  allocation  method used in 2005 for
corporate  charges  and  interest  expense.  This  restatement  had no impact on
consolidated net income or earnings per share.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (CONTINUED)

Reported  net income in total for 2005 was $13.3  million,  or $0.48 per diluted
share ($104.4 million,  or $3.67 per diluted share for 2004; $236.4 million,  or
$8.52 per  diluted  share for  2003).  In 2005,  a $50.4  million,  or $1.84 per
diluted share,  charge to assign our Kendall County power purchase  agreement to
Constellation  Energy  Commodities (see Note 11) reduced net income,  as did the
absence  of  operations  from  our  Automotive  Services  business  spun  off in
September 2004 and the exit from our Water Services businesses,  the majority of
which were sold in 2003. Automotive Services contributed $74.4 million to income
in 2004 ($113.6  million in 2003).  Net income in 2003  included a $71.6 million
net gain on the sale of  substantially  all of our Water Services assets. A $7.8
million non-cash  after-tax charge for a change in accounting  principle related
to  investments  in our emerging  technology  portfolio  also  impacted 2004 net
income. (See Note 15.)

Net income in 2005 reflected  continued  strong electric  sales,  higher Florida
real estate  sales,  increased  earnings on excess  cash,  the benefits of lower
interest expense due to reduced debt balances,  expense reductions following the
spin-off of Automotive  Services and exit from the Water Services  businesses in
2004, tax savings due to comprehensive tax planning  initiatives  implemented in
2005, and positive resolution of income tax audit issues.

Earnings  per share for 2005 were  favorably  impacted  by ALLETE  common  stock
purchased pursuant to the Company's Retirement Savings and Stock Ownership Plan.
(See Note 18.)

Financial  results for continuing  operations for the periods  discussed in this
Form 10-K were  significantly  impacted by the following five  transactions  not
representative of ongoing operations:

   -   KENDALL COUNTY CHARGE. In  2005,  we  incurred  a  $77.9  million  ($50.4
       million  after tax, or $1.84 per share)  charge due to the  assignment of
       the Kendall  County  power  purchase  agreement to  Constellation  Energy
       Commodities (Kendall County Charge).
   -   POSITIVE  RESOLUTION OF TAX AUDIT  ISSUES. In 2005, we  recognized a $3.7
       million,  or $0.13 per  share,  current  tax  benefit  due to a  positive
       resolution of income tax audit issues.
   -   TAX PLANNING  INITIATIVES. In  2005,  we  implemented  comprehensive  tax
       planning initiatives,  which resulted in current and ongoing tax savings,
       and a deferred tax benefit of $2.5 million, or $0.09 per share.
   -   DEBT PREPAYMENT COST. In  2004,  we  incurred  an  $18.5  million  ($10.9
       million  after tax, or $0.38 per share) debt  prepayment  cost as part of
       ALLETE's  financial  restructuring  in  preparation  for the  spin-off of
       Automotive Services.
   -   GAIN ON SALE OF ADESA SHARES.  In 2004, we  recognized an $11.5  million,
       or $0.41 per share, gain on the sale of ADESA shares related to our ESOP.
       (See Note 18.)

Reported  income  from  continuing  operations  before the change in  accounting
principle was $17.6 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, for 2005, a decrease of
$20.9 million, or $0.71 per diluted share from 2004. The decrease was attributed
to the $50.4 million,  or $1.84 per diluted share,  Kendall County Charge.  A 4%
increase in total electric sales,  higher Florida real estate land sales, a $1.9
million increase in earnings on excess cash, a $3.1 million decrease in interest
expense and expense reductions following the spin-off of Automotive Services and
exit from our Water Services  businesses in 2004  partially  offset the negative
impact of the Kendall County  Charge.  In addition,  comprehensive  tax planning
initiatives implemented in 2005 resulted in current and ongoing tax savings, and
a deferred  tax  benefit  equaling  $2.5  million,  or $0.09 per share.  We also
recognized  $3.7  million,  or $0.13 per share,  current  tax  benefit  due to a
positive resolution of income tax audit issues.

NET INCOME

REGULATED UTILITY  contributed income of $45.7 million in 2005 ($37.7 million in
2004; $32.4 million in 2003).  Income was higher in 2005 due to a 4% increase in
overall  regulated  utility  kilowatthour  electric  sales.  Healthier  economic
conditions in Minnesota Power's service  territory  combined with warmer weather
in the summer of 2005 contributed to the increase in kilowatthour  sales. Higher
pension  expense  ($1.0  million) and an increase in  maintenance  expense ($2.0
million)  were  partially  offset by the absence of Split Rock  Energy  expenses
($1.2 million), and lower interest expense ($0.6 million).

Overall,  regulated utility kilowatthour  electric sales in 2004 were similar to
2003.  Sales to retail  and  municipal  customers  were up 5% from  2003,  which
reduced the energy  available  for sale to other power  suppliers  in 2004.  The
increase  in retail and  municipal  sales was due to an 8%  increase in sales to
industrial  customers as a result of our industrial  customers operating at high
production levels, with taconite and paper production at or near capacity.

In 2003,  Regulated  Utility  income also included $1.7 million of equity income
from Split Rock  Energy,  a joint  venture  which we  terminated  in March 2004.
Equity income from Split Rock Energy in 2003  included a $2.3 million  charge to
exit the joint venture.

NONREGULATED  ENERGY  OPERATIONS  reported a $48.5 million loss in 2005 (loss of
$2.9  million in 2004;  income of $1.1  million in 2003),  reflecting  the $50.4
million  charge to  assign  the  Kendall  County  power  purchase  agreement  to
Constellation  Energy Commodities in April 2005. The absence of operating losses
from Kendall County favorably  impacted 2005 financial  results.  Kendall County
operating  losses were $1.9 million in 2005 ($8.5 million in 2004;  $8.2 million
in 2003).  In 2004,  the Kendall  County  operating loss included a $0.7 million
cost to terminate a transmission contract.

Income from Taconite  Harbor was lower in 2005 than 2004,  reflecting  increased
demand revenue offset by higher  operating  expenses.  Demand revenue was higher
primarily as a result of two new 5-year  contracts.  Contract  services  were up
$0.6 million from 2004 as a result of a longer than anticipated scheduled outage
as well as unscheduled  outages in 2005. SO2 emission  allowances expense was up
$1.3 million from 2004.  Depreciation expense was up $0.7 million as a result of
capitalized  projects  being  completed  and placed  into  operation.  Income at
Taconite  Harbor was lower in 2004 than 2003,  primarily  due to a $0.8  million
increase in costs associated with a scheduled  maintenance  outage in 2004 and a
$0.5  million  increase  in costs  for SO2  emission  allowances.  In  addition,
wholesale power prices were lower in 2004 compared to 2003.

In  2005,  income  from our  coal  operations  was up $1.3  million  from  2004,
primarily  due to a 7% increase in tons of coal sold.  In 2004,  coal sales were
lower than 2003 due to an outage at the Square Butte  generating  facility,  BNI
Coal's primary customer.

NET INCOME (CONTINUED)

REAL ESTATE  contributed income of $17.5 million in 2005 ($14.3 million in 2004;
$13.6 million in 2003),  reflecting  continued  strong demand for real estate in
Florida.  In  2005,  we  also  began  selling  property  from  our  Town  Center
development  project in  northeast  Florida.  Since  land is being  sold  before
completion of the project  infrastructure,  revenue and cost of real estate sold
are  recorded  using a  percentage-of-completion  method.  (See  Note  2.) As of
December  31,  2005,  we had $8.6  million of  deferred  profit on sales of real
estate, before taxes and minority interest, on our balance sheet. We expect most
of this  deferred  profit will be reflected in income during the next 12 months.
The timing of the closing of real estate  sales varies from period to period and
impacts comparisons between years.

At December 31, 2005, total pending land sales under contract were $94.9 million
and are  anticipated  to close at various times  through 2012.  Pricing on these
contracts range from $20 to $50 per commercial  square foot,  $15,000 to $40,000
per residential  unit and $1,000 to $524,000 per acre for all other  properties.
Prices per acre are stated on a gross  acreage  basis and are  dependent  on the
type and location of the properties  sold. The majority of the other  properties
under  contract are zoned  commercial  or mixed use. In addition to minimum base
price contracts,  certain contracts allow us to receive participation revenue to
the extent that an agreed upon  percentage  of gross  revenue from land sales by
our purchaser exceeds the minimum base price.

</TABLE>

OTHER  reflected  income of $2.9  million in 2005 ($10.6  million  loss in 2004;
$17.9 million loss in 2003). Improved financial results reflected a $3.7 million
current tax benefit due to the positive resolution of income tax audit issues, a
$2.5 million  deferred  tax benefit  recorded in 2005 due to  comprehensive  tax
planning initiatives,  the decline in interest expense as a result of lower debt
balances  and  increased  earnings  on excess  cash.  Interest  expense was $1.3
million  in 2005 ($4.7  million in 2004;  $14.7  million in 2003).  Earnings  on
excess cash were $3.2  million in 2005 ($1.3  million in 2004;  $0.9  million in
2003).  Cash was higher in 2005 and 2004 than in 2003 due to  proceeds  received
from the sale of our  Water  Services  businesses  in 2004  and  2003,  proceeds
received  from ADESA in 2004 and  proceeds  received  from the sale of  Enventis
Telecom in 2005.

Financial results related to our emerging technology  investments were better in
2005.  Equity losses related to investments in venture capital funds declined in
2005 ($0 in 2005;  $1.6  million in 2004).  Impairments  related to our emerging
technology  investment  were also  lower in 2005  ($3.3  million  in 2005;  $4.1
million in 2004). In 2003, we reported $2.3 million of net losses on the sale of
shares we held directly in publicly-traded, emerging technology investments.

Financial  results for 2004 also  included an $11.5  million gain on the sale of
ADESA stock related to our ESOP (see Note 18),  which was partially  offset by a
$10.9 million debt  prepayment  cost associated with the retirement of long-term
debt as a part of our financial restructuring in preparation for the spin-off of
ADESA.

DISCONTINUED  OPERATIONS includes our Automotive Services business that was spun
off on September 20, 2004, costs incurred by ALLETE associated with the spin-off
of ADESA,  our Water  Services  businesses,  the  majority of which were sold in
2003, and our telecommunications business, which we sold in December 2005.

Earnings from discontinued  operations were lower in 2005,  primarily due to the
absence of operations from Automotive Services.  Automotive Services contributed
income of $74.4  million in 2004  ($113.6  million in 2003).  Income in 2004 was
down $39.2  million from 2003,  reflecting a 6.6%  reduction in our ownership of
ADESA since the June 2004 IPO and the absence of ADESA operations  following the
spin-off.  Income in 2004 was also down due to debt prepayment  costs related to
the early  redemption of ADESA debt in August 2004,  ALLETE's  costs  associated
with the business  separation,  and additional  corporate charges and separation
expenses  incurred by ADESA as it prepared to be a stand-alone,  publicly-traded
company. In addition, 2004 income included $4.1 million of charges in connection
with a lawsuit  related  to  ADESA's  vehicle  import  business.  Income in 2003
reflected strong vehicle sales, fee increases, the introduction and expansion of
service  offerings,  lower  interest  expense due to lower debt  balances at the
time, gains on sale of property and strong  receivable  portfolio  management at
the floorplan  financing  business.  Income in 2003 also included a $1.3 million
recovery  from the  settlement  of a lawsuit  associated  with  ADESA's  vehicle
transport business.

NET INCOME (CONTINUED)

Water Services  financial results reflected a $2.5 million loss in 2005 (loss of
$1.3 million in 2004; income of $93.0 million in 2003). In 2005,  administrative
and other expenses were incurred to support Florida Water transfer  proceedings.
A $1.0 million rate-base  settlement charge related to the sale of 63 of Florida
Water  systems to Aqua  Utilities  was also  recorded in 2005.  A $71.6  million
after-tax  gain was  recognized on the sale of these systems in 2003, net of all
selling,  transaction  and employee  termination  benefit  expenses,  as well as
impairments on certain remaining assets at the time. Gains in 2004 from the sale
of our North Carolina assets and the remaining systems in Florida were offset by
an  adjustment  to gains  reported in 2003,  resulting in an overall net loss of
$0.5  million  in 2004.  The  adjustment  to  gains  reported  in 2003  resulted
primarily from an arbitration  award in December 2004 relating to a gain-sharing
provision on a system sold in 2003.  Financial  results for Water  Services were
also  lower in 2004 and 2005 due to the  absence  of  operations  from water and
wastewater  systems sold.  The majority of our Florida  systems were sold in the
fourth  quarter of 2003.  North  Carolina  assets  were sold in June  2004.  Our
wastewater assets in Georgia were sold in February 2005.

Financial results for our  telecommunications  business reflected a loss of $1.8
million in 2005 (income of $0.6 million in each of the years 2004 and 2003).  In
2005,  we  recorded  a $3.6  million  loss  on the  sale  of  this  business  to
HickoryTech.  In 2005,  income from operations was $1.2 million higher than 2004
primarily due to increased margins on telecommunication services.

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLE  reflected the cumulative  effect on prior years
(to  December  31,  2003) of changing  to the equity  method of  accounting  for
investments in limited liability  companies included in our emerging  technology
portfolio. (See Note 15.)


2005 COMPARED TO 2004

REGULATED UTILITY

     OPERATING  REVENUE was up $20.6  million,  or 4%, from 2004.  Revenue  from
     other power  suppliers was up $15.4 million from 2004 due to a 24% increase
     in  kilowatthour  sales and  higher  market  prices.  In 2005,  changes  in
     scheduled plant outages  resulted in more energy available for sale than in
     2004.  Transmission  revenue  was up $4.2  million  from  2004,  reflecting
     increased  MISO-related  revenue.  In 2005,  the  Company  recovered  $12.1
     million of other MISO expenses,  subject to refund with  interest,  through
     the fuel clause.  (See Outlook.) Revenue from sales to retail and municipal
     customers  was  down  $2.4  million,  primarily  due to lower  fuel  clause
     recoveries in 2005. (See operating  expenses below.)  Kilowatthour sales to
     retail and municipal customers remained strong--up 2% from 2004, reflecting
     increased  usage.  Residential  and municipal  customer usage was higher in
     2005 due to higher  than normal  summer  temperatures  in 2005.  Commercial
     usage was  higher  due to  stronger  economic  conditions  in our  electric
     service  territory in 2005.  Sales to industrial  customers were similar to
     last year because,  as in 2004,  the Company's  industrial  customers  were
     operating at high production levels,  with taconite and paper production at
     or near capacity.  Overall, regulated utility kilowatthour sales were up 4%
     from 2004.  Revenue  from gas sales was up $2.5  million  due to  increased
     prices in the natural gas component of sales.

     OPERATING  EXPENSES  were up $9.7  million,  or 2%,  from  2004.  Fuel  and
     purchased  power  expense  was down  $1.4  million  from  2004 due to fewer
     outages. In 2004,  increased purchased power was necessitated by outages at
     Company  generating  facilities and the Square Butte  generating  facility.
     Maintenance  expense  was up $3.4  million  from 2004,  reflecting  planned
     maintenance  performed at Boswell  Units 1, 2 and 3 during 2005,  partially
     offset by lower  maintenance  expense  related to Boswell Unit 4 and Laskin
     Unit 1. In 2004, maintenance expense increased due to maintenance scheduled
     for 2005 and 2006 that was  performed  while  Boswell  Unit 4 was down as a
     result of a generator  failure.  Other operating expenses were $7.7 million
     higher  in  2005--MISO  transmission  costs  increased  $4.1  million,  gas
     purchases  increased $2.6 million due to higher prices and pension  expense
     increased $1.7 million due to a change in the discount rate (5.50% in 2005;
     5.75% in 2004).  These  increases were  partially  offset by the absence of
     $2.0 million of expenses  related to Split Rock Energy,  which we exited in
     March 2004.

     INTEREST  EXPENSE was down $1.1 million from 2004,  primarily  due to lower
     effective interest rates (6.07% in 2005; 6.67% in 2004).


ALLETE 2005 Form 10-K                                                    Page 36

2005 COMPARED TO 2004 (CONTINUED)

NONREGULATED ENERGY OPERATIONS

     OPERATING  REVENUE  was up $7.1  million,  or 7%, from 2004.  Revenue  from
     Taconite Harbor increased $14.0 million from 2004,  primarily due to higher
     demand as a result of two 5-year  contracts (175 MW in total) that began in
     May 2005. Coal revenue,  realized under a cost-plus  contract,  was up $5.0
     million from 2004,  reflecting a 7% increase in tons of coal sold and an 8%
     increase  in the  delivery  price  per ton due to  higher  coal  production
     expenses.  (See operating expenses below.) BNI Coal sold fewer tons of coal
     in 2004 due to a scheduled outage at the Square Butte generating  facility.
     Revenue from Kendall  County was down $13.4  million from 2004,  reflecting
     the absence of  operations  since April 2005 when the Kendall  County power
     purchase  agreement  was  assigned  to  Constellation  Energy  Commodities.
     Overall, nonregulated kilowatthour sales were up 2% from 2004.

     OPERATING  EXPENSES were up $78.0  million from 2004,  primarily due to the
     $77.9 million  charge related to the assignment of the Kendall County power
     purchase  agreement  to  Constellation  Energy  Commodities  in April 2005.
     Nonregulated  generation  fuel and  purchased  power expense was down $11.7
     million from 2004,  reflecting  the absence of Kendall  County  operations.
     Operating and maintenance  expenses at Taconite Harbor were higher in 2005,
     reflecting a $2.3 million  increase in SO2 emission  allowance  expense,  a
     $1.0 million increase in contract services due to a longer than anticipated
     scheduled  outage  as  well  as  unscheduled  outages,  and a $1.2  million
     increase in depreciation  expense as a result of capitalized projects being
     completed  and  placed  into  operation.   Expenses  related  to  our  coal
     operations were up $3.9 million,  in part due to higher expenses associated
     with equipment repairs, increased fuel costs and a $2.1 million increase in
     lease expense related to the dragline.

     INTEREST  EXPENSE  was  up  $1.7  million  from  2004,   reflecting  higher
     allocations in 2005.

     OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  reflected $1.1 million more income in 2005.  Income
     from customer  contract services was up $0.4 million from 2004. Income from
     Minnesota  land sales was up $0.7  million from 2004,  primarily  due to an
     adjustment recorded as a result of an MPUC land reevaluation.

REAL ESTATE

     OPERATING REVENUE was up $5.6 million, or 13%, from 2004, reflecting strong
     land sales offset by the deferral of revenue  associated  with certain real
     estate  sales.  Revenue  from land sales was $42.0  million in 2005  ($35.8
     million in 2004). Town Center land sales accounted for $4.5 million of land
     sale revenue in 2005. In 2005, revenue of $10.0 million,  primarily related
     to Town Center land sales, was deferred until  development  obligations are
     completed ($1.5 million in 2004).  Revenue from lot sales was lower in 2005
     because in January 2004 we sold the remaining  184 lots at Sugarmill  Woods
     for $3.9  million,  essentially  exiting the lot sales  business.  In 2005,
     1,172  acres and 7 lots were sold,  of which 70 acres were  located in Town
     Center.  Town Center sales  included  assignments  of rights to build up to
     643,000 square feet of commercial  space. In 2004, 1,479 acres and 211 lots
     were sold. Revenue from our brokerage business, Cape Properties,  Inc., was
     down $0.7 million, reflecting unusually strong sales in 2004.

     OPERATING  EXPENSES  were up $0.5 million,  or 3%, from 2004.  Cost of real
     estate sold was $2.1  million  higher in 2005 ($8.6  million in 2005;  $6.5
     million in 2004) due to the type and location of real estate sold. In 2005,
     cost of real estate sold  totaling  $2.2 million ($0.4 million in 2004) and
     selling  expense of $0.3  million,  primarily  related to Town  Center land
     sales, were deferred until development obligations are completed.  Expenses
     for our brokerage  business were down $0.2 million due to unusually  strong
     sales in 2004.  Selling  expenses  were down $1.1  million from 2004 due to
     lower  transaction  costs and fewer  brokerage  commissions  on 2005 sales.
     Property taxes were down $0.3 million from 2004,  reflecting a reduction in
     land owned.

OTHER

     OPERATING EXPENSES were up $0.9 million,  or 28%, from 2004,  primarily due
     to increased compensation.

     INTEREST  EXPENSE was down $5.7 million from 2004,  primarily  due to lower
     debt  balances.  The  Company  repaid  a $53  million  balance  on a credit
     agreement  in April  2004 and $125  million of 7.80%  Senior  Notes in July
     2004. A combination of  internally-generated  funds, proceeds from the sale
     of our Water Services assets and proceeds  received from ADESA were used to
     repay the debt.

     OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  reflected $11.6 million less expense in 2005. Other
     income  (expense) in 2005 reflected a $3.2 million  increase in earnings on
     excess  cash, a $1.2  million  decrease in equity  losses from our emerging
     technology  investments and a $1.0 million charge to recognize the probable
     payment  under our guarantee of Northwest  Airlines  debt. We also recorded
     $5.1 million of impairments related to our emerging technology  investments
     in 2005 ($6.5 million in 2004). In 2004, other income (expense) included an
     $18.5 million debt prepayment cost related to the early  redemption of $125
     million in senior notes,  an $11.5 million gain on the sale of ADESA shares
     held in our ESOP (see Note 18),  and $0.9  million  of income  from a rabbi
     trust, established to secure certain deferred executive compensation.

2005 COMPARED TO 2004 (CONTINUED)

INCOME TAXES. The effective tax rate from continuing  operations before minority
interest  was a 2.5%  benefit in 2005 (28.8%  expense in 2004).  Income taxes in
2005 were affected by three major items,  the  adjustment of our deferred  taxes
from  comprehensive  tax  planning  initiatives,  a current tax benefit from the
positive  resolution of audit issues and the inability to use state capital loss
carryforwards.  The  adjustment  of our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities
resulted in a deferred tax benefit of $2.5 million.  We received an audit report
resolving  open issues that  resulted in a current tax benefit of $3.7  million.
These  items  decreased  our  overall  tax  expense.   The  emerging  technology
investment  impairments  recorded  in March 2005 and the Kendall  County  Charge
recorded in April 2005 created  capital  losses.  The current  benefit for these
items was limited to a federal  benefit for income tax  purposes.  The state tax
benefit from these items is not  expected to be realized  currently or in future
periods.  The benefit related to these state net capital loss  carryforwards was
fully  offset by a  valuation  allowance.  This  resulted  in an increase in our
overall tax expense.  Current taxes also increased in 2005 due to the expiration
of the  accelerated  depreciation  deduction  allowed by the Jobs and Growth Tax
Relief Act of 2003,  which expired December 31, 2004. An increase in the Federal
Medicare  subsidy and the new Domestic  Manufacturing  Deduction  contributed to
lower taxes in 2005.  Income taxes for 2004 were primarily  affected as a result
of the benefit of the nontaxable gain from the sale of ADESA common stock in our
ESOP. (See Note 13.)


2004 COMPARED TO 2003

REGULATED UTILITY

     OPERATING  REVENUE was up $45.0 million,  or 9%, in 2004,  primarily due to
     higher fuel clause  recoveries  resulting  from increased  purchased  power
     costs (see operating  expenses below) and increased retail sales.  Overall,
     regulated utility  kilowatthour  sales were similar to 2003 (up 1%) as a 5%
     increase  in sales to retail and  municipal  customers  reduced  the energy
     available for sale to other power suppliers. Much of the increase in retail
     and municipal electric sales was attributable to large industrial customers
     due  to  their  higher  production  levels  in  2004.  Outages  at  Company
     generating  facilities  and a  scheduled  maintenance  outage at the Square
     Butte generating  facility (see operating  expenses below) also contributed
     to less energy being available for sale to other power suppliers.

     OPERATING  EXPENSES  in  total  were up  $37.2  million,  or 8%,  in  2004,
     primarily  due to a $32.6  million  increase  in fuel and  purchased  power
     expense.  Increased  purchased power was necessitated by outages at Company
     generating facilities and the Square Butte generating facility. In February
     2004, we experienced a generator failure at our 534-MW Boswell Unit 4. Unit
     4 came back into  service  in June  2004.  As a result of the  failure,  we
     replaced  significant  components  of the  generator  at a capital  cost of
     approximately $6 million.  The majority of the replacement cost was covered
     by insurance,  subject to a deductible of $1 million. We entered into power
     purchase agreements to replace the power lost during the Unit 4 outage. The
     cost of this additional power was recovered  through the regulated  utility
     fuel  clause in  Minnesota.  While  Unit 4 was down,  some work  originally
     planned  for 2005 and 2006 was done  during the outage to  minimize  future
     outages.  This  outage  did not have a  material  impact on our  results of
     operations. Two multi-week scheduled maintenance outages also took place at
     our  55-MW  Laskin  Unit 1 and at the  Square  Butte  generating  facility.
     Maintenance  expense was $3.2 million higher in 2004,  primarily due to the
     outages  at our  generating  facilities.  Our pro rata  share of the Square
     Butte maintenance  outage costs was approximately $5 million.  In addition,
     2004 reflected a $4.4 million increase in pension expense,  $1.7 million of
     MISO  related  expenses,  a $2.6  million  decrease  in Split  Rock  Energy
     expenses as a result of our  exiting the joint  venture in March 2004 and a
     $1.7 million decrease in depreciation  expense.  In 2004, the MPUC approved
     longer depreciable lives for certain Company generating assets.

     INTEREST EXPENSE was down $1.9 million from 2003 due to lower debt balances
     and lower effective interest rates (6.67% in 2004; 6.88% in 2003).

     OTHER  INCOME  (EXPENSE)  reflected  $2.8  million  less  income  in  2004,
     primarily  due to the  absence  of equity in net  income  from  Split  Rock
     Energy. Minnesota Power withdrew from Split Rock Energy trading activities,
     effective November 1, 2003, and terminated the joint venture in March 2004.

NONREGULATED ENERGY OPERATIONS

     OPERATING  REVENUE  in  2004  was  similar  to  2003  as a 2%  increase  in
     kilowatthour   sales  was  mostly   offset  by  lower   wholesale   prices.
     Kilowatthour  sales were up 8% at Taconite  Harbor despite a fourth quarter
     2004 scheduled  maintenance  outage,  while  kilowatthour  sales at Kendall
     County were down 26% from 2003.

     OPERATING  EXPENSES  were up $6.4  million,  or 6%,  in 2004  due to a $1.1
     million increase in fuel and purchased power expense, $1.3 million of costs
     associated with a scheduled  maintenance  outage at Taconite Harbor, a $1.2
     million  transmission  contract termination charge to exit a Kendall County
     agreement and a $0.9 million increase in costs for SO2 emission allowances.
     Expenses in 2003  reflected a $0.9 million  reduction  in costs  accrued in
     2002 related to the indefinite  delay of a generation  project in Superior,
     Wisconsin.

     OTHER INCOME  (EXPENSE)  reflected $1.3 million of less income in 2004. The
     decrease was  attributable  to a reduction in gains on prior Minnesota land
     sales due to an MPUC required land reevaluation.

2004 COMPARED TO 2003 (CONTINUED)

REAL ESTATE

     OPERATING REVENUE was down $0.7 million,  or 2%, in 2004. Revenue from land
     sales in 2004 was similar to 2003,  reflecting a strong  southwest  Florida
     real estate market that began in the fall of 2003 and continued  into 2004.
     In 2004,  we sold 1,479 acres and 211 lots for $35.8  million  (1,394 acres
     and 265 lots for $36.0  million in 2003).  In 2004,  land sales  revenue of
     $1.5 million was deferred until development  obligations are completed.  At
     December 31, 2004,  total land sales under  contract  were $71 million,  of
     which  $30  million  were for  properties  in the Town  Center  development
     project  at Palm  Coast.  Revenue  in 2003  also  included  a $1.1  million
     recovery of a partially reserved receivable.

     OPERATING EXPENSES were down $1.3 million,  or 8%, in 2004 because the cost
     of property  sold in 2004 was lower than in 2003.  Cost of real estate sold
     in 2004 was $6.5  million  ($7.9  million in 2003).  In 2004,  cost of real
     estate  sold   totaling  $0.4  million  was  deferred   until   development
     obligations are completed.

OTHER

     OPERATING  EXPENSES were down $1.0 million,  or 24%, in 2004,  reflecting a
     reduction in expenses  following  the spin-off of  Automotive  Services and
     exit from the Water Services businesses in 2003.

     INTEREST  EXPENSE was down $17.1 million from 2003,  primarily due to lower
     debt balances. We repaid $25 million of 6 1/4% First Mortgage Bonds in July
     2003;  $50 million of 7 3/4% First  Mortgage  Bonds in November  2003;  $75
     million of mandatorily  redeemable  preferred  securities in December 2003;
     $3.5 million of Industrial  Development  Revenue Bonds in January 2004; and
     $125 million of 7.80% Senior Notes in July 2004. In addition,  $111 million
     of Pollution  Control  Refunding  Revenue Bonds were  refinanced at a lower
     rate in August 2004 and a $250  million  credit  agreement  entered into in
     July 2003 was paid off early  ($197  million in 2003;  $53 million in April
     2004). A combination of internally-generated  funds, proceeds from the sale
     of our Water Services assets and proceeds  received from ADESA were used to
     repay the debt.

     OTHER INCOME  (EXPENSE)  reflected  $10.4 million of additional  expense in
     2004, primarily due to an $18.5 million debt prepayment cost related to the
     early  redemption  of $125 million in senior notes in 2004 and $6.5 million
     of impairments recorded related to our emerging technology investments.  In
     addition,  $1.7 million of equity losses on emerging  technology funds were
     recognized  in 2004.  These  decreases  were  partially  offset by an $11.5
     million gain on the sale of ADESA  shares held in our ESOP.  (See Note 18.)
     In 2003, we recognized $3.5 million of losses related to the sale of shares
     we held directly in publicly-traded emerging technology investments.

INCOME TAXES.  Income taxes for 2004 were primarily  affected as a result of the
benefit of the nontaxable  gain from the sale of ADESA common stock in our ESOP.
Income taxes for 2003 were slightly lower than the statutory rate due to the
effects of investment tax credits.


NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We  prepare  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  Along with this
information,  we disclose and discuss certain non-GAAP financial  information in
our  quarterly  earnings  releases,  on  investor  conference  calls and  during
investor  conferences  and related  events.  Management  believes  that non-GAAP
financial data supplements our GAAP financial  statements by providing investors
with additional  information which enhances the investors' overall understanding
of our financial performance and the comparability of our operating results from
period to period.  The presentation of this additional  information is not meant
to be considered  in isolation or as a substitute  for our results of operations
prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.

As earlier mentioned,  financial results for 2005 were significantly impacted by
the following transactions:

   -   A  $50.4  million  after  tax,  or  $1.84  per  share,  charge due to the
       assignment   of  the  Kendall   County   power   purchase   agreement  to
       Constellation Energy Commodities (see Note 11);
   -   A $3.7 million, or $0.13 per share, current tax benefit due to a positive
       resolution of income tax audit issues; and
   -   A  $2.5  million,  or  $0.09  per  share, deferred  tax  benefit due   to
       comprehensive tax planning initiatives.

In   2004, financial  results  were  significantly impacted  by  the   following
transactions:

   -   A $10.9 million after tax, or $0.38 per  share, debt  prepayment cost  as
       part of ALLETE's financial  restructuring in preparation for the spin-off
       of Automotive Services (see Note 12); and
   -   An $11.5 million after tax, or $0.41 per share, gain on the sale of ADESA
       shares related to our ESOP (see Note 18).

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (CONTINUED)

Since these  transactions  significantly  impacted  the  financial  results from
continuing operations in 2005 and 2004, we believe that for comparative purposes
and a more  accurate  reflection  of our  ongoing  operations,  it is  useful to
present  diluted  earnings  per  share  from  continuing   operations  for  each
applicable  period  excluding  the  impact  of  these  items.  The  table  below
reconciles actual reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations
before change in accounting principle to the adjusted results that exclude these
transactions in the respective periods.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Certain accounting  measurements under applicable  generally accepted accounting
principles involve management's judgment about subjective factors and estimates,
the effects of which are inherently uncertain.  These policies are reviewed with
the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a regular basis.  The following
summarizes  those  accounting  measurements  we believe are most critical to our
reported results of operations and financial condition.

REAL ESTATE REVENUE AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION. We account for sales of real estate
in accordance with SFAS 66,  "Accounting for Sales of Real Estate." Revenue from
commercial,  office,  industrial and  residential  properties is recorded at the
time of closing  using the full profit  recognition  method,  provided that cash
collections are at least 20% of the contract price and the other requirements of
SFAS 66 are met. However, if we are obligated to perform significant development
activities  subsequent to the date of the sale,  we recognize  revenue using the
percentage-of-completion  method.  This method of  accounting  requires  that we
recognize gross profit based upon the relationship of development costs incurred
to the total  estimated  costs to develop the  parcels.  During  each  reporting
period,  we  must  estimate  the  total  costs  to  be  incurred  until  project
completion,  including  development overhead and interest  capitalization costs.
These total cost estimates will impact the  recognition of profit on sales.  The
costs are  allocated  to each lot or parcel  based on the  relative  sales value
method.  These estimates affect the amount of costs relieved as each lot is sold
and incorrect  estimates may result in a misstatement of the cost of real estate
sold. Additionally, we must estimate the selling price of each individual lot or
parcel that is included in inventory for inclusion in the inventory  cost model.
If the  estimated  selling  prices  of  the  lots  are  inaccurate,  a  material
difference in the timing of recording cost of real estate sold for the lots sold
could occur.

We  record  land  held for sale at the  lower  of cost or fair  value,  which is
determined  by the  evaluation of  individual  land  parcels.  Real estate costs
include the cost of land  acquired,  subsequent  development  costs and costs of
improvements,  capitalized  development  period interest,  real estate taxes and
payroll costs of certain employees  devoted directly to the development  effort.
Based  on the  relative  sales  value of the  parcels  within  each  development
project, we capitalize the real estate costs incurred to the cost of real estate
parcels in accordance  with SFAS 67,  "Accounting  for Costs and Initial  Rental
Operations  of Real Estate  Projects."  When real estate is sold, we include the
actual costs incurred and the estimate of future  completion  costs allocated to
the parcel(s)  sold,  based upon the relative  sales value method in the cost of
real  estate  sold.  We  include  land  held  for  sale  in  Investments  on our
consolidated  balance  sheet.  Traffic  impact fee credits  are  provided to the
developer as mitigation  payments are made to the city. We are reimbursed  after
the  land  is  sold  and  a  subsequent   property  owner  constructs   vertical
improvements on the site. We recognize  revenue  resulting from these reimbursed
fees when they are received.

We  annually  review  the  real  estate   carrying  value  for  impairment.   If
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we record
the impairment and adjust the related assets to their  estimated fair value less
costs to sell.

IMPAIRMENT  OF  LONG-LIVED  ASSETS.  We  account  for our  long-lived  assets at
depreciated  historical  cost. A long-lived  asset is tested for  recoverability
whenever  events or changes in  circumstances  indicate that its carrying amount
may not be recoverable.  We conduct this assessment using SFAS 144,  "Accounting
for  the   Impairment  and  Disposal  of  Long-Lived   Assets."   Judgments  and
uncertainties  affecting  the  application  of accounting  for asset  impairment
include economic conditions affecting market valuations, changes in our business
strategy,  and  changes  in our  forecast  of future  operating  cash  flows and
earnings. We would recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a
long-lived  asset is not recoverable  from its  undiscounted  future cash flows.
Management  judgment is involved in both deciding if testing for  recoverability
is necessary and in estimating undiscounted cash flows.


ALLETE 2005 Form 10-K                                                    Page 40


<PAGE>


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH AND LIFE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. We account for
our  pension and  postretirement  benefit  obligations  in  accordance  with the
provisions  of SFAS 87,  "Employers'  Accounting  for  Pensions,"  and SFAS 106,
"Employers'  Accounting for Postretirement  Benefits Other Than Pensions." These
standards  require the use of  assumptions in determining  the  obligations  and
annual  cost.  An  important   actuarial   assumption   for  pension  and  other
postretirement  benefit plans is the expected  long-term  rate of return on plan
assets. In establishing  this assumption,  we consider the  diversification  and
allocation of plan assets, the actual long-term  historical  performance for the
type of securities invested in, the actual long-term  historical  performance of
plan assets and the impact of current economic conditions,  if any, on long-term
historical returns. Our pension asset allocation is approximately 70% equity and
30%  fixed-rate  securities.  Equity  securities  consist  of a  mix  of  market
capitalization  sizes and also  include  investments  in real estate and venture
capital.  We  currently  use an expected  long-term  rate of return of 9% in our
pension  actuarial  study.  We annually  review our expected  long-term  rate of
return  assumption  and  will  adjust  it to  respond  to  any  changing  market
conditions.  A 1/2%  decrease in the  expected  long-term  rate of return  would
increase  the annual  expense for pension and other  postretirement  benefits by
approximately $1 million after tax; conversely,  a 1/2% increase in the expected
long-term rate of return would decrease the annual expense by  approximately  $1
million after tax. Currently for plan valuation purposes, we use a discount rate
of 5.5%.  The discount rate is  determined  considering  high-quality  long-term
corporate  bond rates at the  valuation  date.  The discount rate is compared to
various  bond  indices  for  reasonableness.  We believe  the bonds used in this
comparison do not  materially  differ in duration and cash flows for our pension
obligation.  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors  annually reviews and
approves the rate of return and  discount  rate used for pension  valuation  and
accounting  purposes.  (See Note 17 for  additional  detail on our  pension  and
postretirement health and life plans.)

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS.  As part of our emerging technology portfolio, we have
several  minority  investments  in  venture  capital  funds and  privately-held,
start-up companies. We account for our investment in venture capital funds under
the  equity  method and  account  for our direct  investment  in  privately-held
companies  under the cost  method  because of our  ownership  percentage.  These
investments are included in Investments on our  consolidated  balance sheet. Our
policy is to quarterly review these investments for impairment by assessing such
factors as continued commercial  viability of products,  cash flow and earnings.
Any  impairment  would  reduce  the  carrying  value  of the  investment  and be
recognized as a loss.  In 2005,  we recorded  $5.1 million  pretax of impairment
losses on these investments ($6.5 million pretax in 2004; $0 in 2003).

PROVISION  FOR  ENVIRONMENTAL   REMEDIATION.   Our  businesses  are  subject  to
regulation  by  various  federal,   state  and  local   authorities   concerning
environmental  matters.  We review  environmental  matters on a quarterly basis.
Accruals  for  environmental  matters are  recorded  when it is probable  that a
liability  has been  incurred and the amount of the  liability can be reasonably
estimated,  based on current law and existing  technologies.  These accruals are
adjusted  periodically as assessment and  remediation  efforts  progress,  or as
additional  technical  or legal  information  becomes  available.  Accruals  for
environmental  liabilities  are  included in the balance  sheet at  undiscounted
amounts and exclude claims for recoveries from insurance or other third parties.
Costs related to environmental  contamination  treatment and cleanup are charged
to expense.  We do not currently  anticipate  that  potential  expenditures  for
environmental  remediation and cleanup will be material;  however,  if we become
subject to more stringent  remediation at known sites, if we discover additional
contamination  or previously  unknown sites,  or if we become subject to related
personal or property  damage,  we could incur material costs in connection  with
our environmental remediation.

TAXATION.  We are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects
of various  financial  transactions  and our ongoing  operations to estimate our
obligations to taxing  authorities.  These tax obligations  include income, real
estate and use taxes.  These judgments  include  reserves for potential  adverse
outcomes  regarding  tax positions  that we have taken.  We must also assess our
ability to  generate  capital  gains to realize  tax  benefits  associated  with
capital losses expected to be generated in future periods. Capital losses may be
deducted  only to the extent of capital  gains  realized  during the year of the
loss or during the three prior or five  succeeding  years for federal  purposes,
and fifteen  succeeding  years for Minnesota.  As of December 31, 2005, we have,
where  appropriate,  recorded  an  allowance  against  our  deferred  tax assets
associated with realized capital losses, and with impairment losses,  which will
become  capital  losses when realized for income tax purposes.  While we believe
the  resulting  tax reserve  balances as of December 31, 2005,  reflect the most
likely outcome of these tax matters in accordance  with SFAS 5,  "Accounting for
Contingencies" and SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," the ultimate outcome
of such  matters  could result in  additional  adjustments  to our  consolidated
financial statements and such adjustments could be material.

OUTLOOK

Our vision is to forge a vibrant  business  that will sustain the  confidence of
investors,  while  maintaining  the trust of communities we have energized for a
century.  We will  pursue  consistent  growth  in our  energy  and  real  estate
businesses,  and invest in other diverse  business  ventures that bring value to
shareholders.

We  believe  our  shareholders  are best  served by a company  with  sustainable
earnings growth and cash flow that supports  dividend and stock price growth. We
believe  our  shareholders  are best  served by a  business  mix that  mitigates
economic  cycles,  and a company that  maintains  the respect and  admiration of
regulators and policy makers.

We value  earning a return  that  rewards  our  shareholders,  reinvests  in our
business and sustains our growth. In the last 10 years, our average annual total
shareholder  return was 16%.  Approximately 5% of this average was attributed to
dividends.  A $100 investment in ALLETE stock at the end of 1995 would have been
worth $443 at the end of 2005,  assuming  reinvestment  of dividends  and shares
received  in the ADESA  distribution  were sold and  reinvested  in  ALLETE.  By
comparison,  the Standard & Poor's 500 Index averaged 9% for the same period, of
which  approximately  2% of the  average was  attributed  to  dividends.  A $100
investment in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index at the end of 1995 would have been
worth $238 at the end of 2005, assuming reinvestment of dividends. We also value
serving  customers  in  a  manner  which  meets  their  needs,   promotes  their
satisfaction and supports our mutual long-term success.

EARNINGS  GUIDANCE.  In  2006,  we  expect  ALLETE's  earnings  per  share  from
continuing operations to grow by 15% to 20%. The growth is expected to come from
continued strong electric sales, increased real estate sales, the elimination of
projected  operating  losses from Kendall  County and our  investment in ATC. In
addition,  we do not anticipate  recording  impairments  related to our emerging
technology  portfolio.  This  earnings  expectation  is based on a 2005  diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.26, which excludes the $1.84
per share Kendall  County  charge,  a $0.13 per share current tax benefit due to
the  positive  resolution  of  income  tax  audit  issues  and a $0.09 per share
deferred  tax  benefit  due to  comprehensive  tax  planning  initiatives.  (See
Non-GAAP  Financial  Measures.) Our 2006 earnings  expectation  does not include
earnings from additional investments we may make in growth initiatives.

ENERGY.  Over the next several  years,  we believe  electric  utilities  will be
facing the unfolding impacts of three major  developments that occurred in 2005:
changes in  regional  transmission  operation;  the start of  rulemaking  on the
enactment  of  stricter  environmental  regulations;   and  federal  legislation
impacting the structure and organization of the electric utility  industry.  The
FERC  has  consolidated  many  transmission   regions,   which  impacts  states'
transmission  regulation  rights and is intended to result in more  standardized
wholesale power markets to oversee how transmission and energy market prices are
determined.  As part of this larger policy effort,  MISO launched  day-ahead and
real-time  energy  market  operations  on April 1, 2005 (MISO Day 2).  While the
initial  mechanics  of the market  launch were  accomplished  successfully,  the
market itself is still evolving. Consequently, as we work through these matters,
we will be  assessing  the  longer  term  impact  of the MISO  Day 2  market  on
Minnesota   Power's   operations.   Rulemakings   for   stricter   environmental
requirements on several  pollutants were issued by the EPA in 2005 and the final
outcomes of these  regulatory  processes  are  expected  to require  significant
capital investments in the 2008 to 2012 timeframe.  The expenditures will relate
to new emission controls on existing  generating units. In August 2005, Congress
passed the Energy  Policy Act of 2005,  which  included the repeal of PUHCA 1935
and enacted  PUHCA 2005.  PUHCA 1935 imposed  geographic  restrictions  on large
electric and gas utility operations and limited diversification into non-utility
businesses.  While the exact  impact of PUHCA  2005 is  unknown,  more  electric
industry consolidation could occur and new investors could enter the industry.

We believe our energy  businesses are well positioned to successfully  deal with
the  issues we have  described  and to compete  successfully.  Our access to and
ownership of low-cost power are our greatest  strengths.  We anticipate  that we
will have ready access to sufficient capital for general business  purposes.  We
believe electric industry  deregulation is unlikely in Minnesota or Wisconsin in
the next five years.

MISO AND FUEL CLAUSE.  As a result of MISO Day 2  implementation  in April 2005,
energy  transactions  to serve retail  customers are sourced  through  wholesale
transactions with MISO as the counterparty. We filed a petition with the MPUC in
February 2005 to amend our fuel clause to accommodate  costs and revenue related
to MISO Day 2 market  implementation.  In March 2005, the MPUC approved  interim
ratemaking  treatment  of MISO  Day 2 costs,  which  allowed  these  costs to be
recovered through the fuel clause, subject to refund with interest.

In  December  2005,  the MPUC  issued an order that  denied  recovery  of uplift
charges,  congestion revenue and expenses,  and administrative  costs related to
our MISO Day 2 market  activities  through the fuel clause.  As a result of that
order,  we filed a Notice of Intent to Withdraw  from MISO on December 29, 2005,
and began  exploring  alternatives  to MISO.  Withdrawal  from MISO  would  also
require MPUC and FERC approval.

<PAGE>


OUTLOOK (CONTINUED)

We  requested  rehearing  of the order in a filing made with the MPUC in January
2006.  Three other  utilities in the state  affected by the order also filed for
rehearing,  as did the DOC and MISO.  On  February  9,  2006,  the MPUC  granted
rehearing of the MISO Day 2 docket and suspended the refund obligation. The MPUC
will review the MISO Day 2 costs to determine which costs should be recovered on
a current basis  through the fuel clause and which costs are more  appropriately
deferred for potential  recovery through base rates.

In 2003, the MPUC initiated an investigation  into the continuing  usefulness of
the fuel clause as a regulatory tool for electric  utilities.  The initial steps
of the investigation were to review the clause's original purpose, structure and
rationale  (including its current operation and relevance in today's  regulatory
environment),  and then address its ongoing  appropriateness and other issues if
the need for continued  use of the fuel clause is shown.  The MPUC has not taken
action on any proposal and, as a result, we are unable to predict the outcome or
impact of this proceeding at this time.

RATE CASE.  Minnesota  Power does not expect to file a request to increase rates
for its retail utility  operations  during 2006. We will,  however,  continue to
monitor the costs of serving our retail  customers  and  evaluate the need for a
rate filing in the future.  Minnesota  Power's  retail rates are based on a 1994
MPUC retail rate order.  SWL&P's  electric  retail rates are based on a May 2005
PSCW retail rate order. In 2006, SWL&P plans to file for an increase in rates to
be effective beginning in 2007 for its electric, water and gas utility services.

INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS.  Approximately 50% of our regulated utility electric sales
are made to our Large  Power  Customers  in the  taconite,  paper and pulp,  and
pipeline industries.  Based on our research of the taconite industry,  Minnesota
taconite  production  for 2006 is again  anticipated to be about 41 million tons
(41 million  tons in each of the years 2005 and 2004;  35 million tons in 2003).
Although the current taconite pellet market is strong,  the taconite industry is
cyclical and subject to several factors, which could change this forecast.  Some
paper   industry   analysts  are  cautiously   optimistic   about  either  price
stabilization  or a small  increase in paper prices during 2006 due to temporary
or permanent  closures of capacity that occurred in 2005. For the North American
paper industry, the potential for either of these positive developments to occur
will, in large part, depend upon the level of imports and what happens to fiber,
chemical  and  energy  costs.  If there is a  significant  change  in the  major
industries  served by Minnesota Power, we expect that any excess energy not used
by our retail  customers  will be marketed  primarily to the regional  wholesale
market.

Several natural  resource-based  companies have been making significant progress
developing new projects in northeastern Minnesota.  Minnesota Power has actively
supported   these  projects  which  include  paper,   ferrous  and   non-ferrous
developments  projected to be  constructed  and on-line  within the next several
years. If these projects proceed, Minnesota Power could serve between 100 MW and
500 MW of new load.

In 2005, we reached new long-term,  all requirements agreements with five of our
Large Power  Customers,  extending  contracts  for an  additional  four to eight
years.   The  extension  of  our  electric  supply  contracts  is  an  important
achievement  for both our Large Power  Customers and Minnesota  Power.  Electric
power is a key  component in the  production  of taconite  and paper,  and these
industries  represent  more than half of  Minnesota  Power's  regulated  utility
electric sales. These agreements help to provide planning certainty for both our
customers and us. Our strong  relationships with industrial customers are unique
in the electric  industry and enable us to work closely with them to help ensure
their success.  We continue to maintain these  relationships  with this group of
customers to help retain a solid  industrial base in our region.  We continue to
make  investments  to  maintain  and improve the  integrity  of our  generating,
transmission and distribution assets, and maintain environmental compliance.

RESOURCE  PLAN. In 2004, we filed an integrated  resource plan  (Resource  Plan)
with the MPUC,  detailing our retail energy  demand  projections  and our energy
sourcing  options to meet projected demand over the next 15 years. In an updated
forecast to that plan, we predict that retail demand by customers in our service
territory  will increase at an average annual rate of 1.5% to 2019. We project a
load  growth  of  approximately  150 MW by 2010  with  another  200 MW of growth
anticipated  by 2015.  The  forecasted  growth  of 15 MW to 28 MW per  year,  is
primarily from  residential  and smaller  commercial  expansion,  and a positive
outlook from Large Power Customers in northeastern  Minnesota,  such as taconite
processing  facilities  and paper  mills.  We expect a reduction  in  generating
resource supply over the next few years under the terms of our long-term  energy
supply  contract with Square Butte.  The  combination  of increased  demands and
reduced supply means we will need to secure additional base load energy to serve
our customers in future years.

We have been working with  regulators  and other  stakeholders  to determine the
best way to meet our projected  customer  needs for more  electricity  reliably,
cost-effectively and in an environmentally  responsible way. In October 2005, we
proposed  to the MPUC a  comprehensive  solution  to meet our  generation  needs
through 2010 that includes the following key components:

   -   Transitioning our Taconite Harbor  generating facility from  nonregulated
       energy  operations to regulated  utility to help meet our forecasted base
       load energy requirements. With MPUC approval, our proposal would make the
       integration of Taconite Harbor into Minnesota  Power's  regulated utility
       business  effective  retroactive  to January 1, 2006.  Current  wholesale
       contracts  sourced from  Taconite  Harbor will be honored  through  their
       terms,

OUTLOOK (CONTINUED)

       which  extend  through  mid-2010.  Taconite  Harbor  would  then meet the
       majority  of our  near-term  increased  demand  for  electricity  without
       requiring the construction of new assets.
   -   Supplementing  Taconite Harbor  generation  with  a 50-MW long-term power
       purchase agreement to meet near-term energy needs.
   -   Supporting the expansion of our renewable  generating assets and  helping
       to meet Minnesota's Renewable Energy Objective that seeks a 10% supply of
       qualified  renewable  energy  resources  in the  state  by 2015  for each
       Minnesota  utility.  We  have  received  regulatory  approval  of a power
       purchase  agreement for 50 MW of energy purchased from a wind facility in
       North  Dakota.  We are also  continuing  to  pursue an  agreement  for an
       additional  50 MW of wind  energy  from  facilities  located in  northern
       Minnesota  (see  Wind  Power)  and  are  proposing  to  obtain  10  MW of
       additional  hydro   generation   through  an  expansion  of  one  of  our
       hydroelectric stations.

Final  regulatory  approval of our Resource Plan and the  transition of Taconite
Harbor is expected in mid 2006.

We are also  exploring  construction  and purchase  options for our  anticipated
resource  needs  by  2015.  In  2005,  Minnesota  Power,  Basin  Electric  Power
Cooperative,  Minnkota Power and  Montana-Dakota  Utilities  Company announced a
project   development   agreement  to  evaluate  the   feasibility  of  a  joint
lignite-fueled  generating  resource in the vicinity of the  existing  Milton R.
Young generating station near Center, North Dakota. The North Dakota feasibility
study is expected to take about one year to complete. A formal study is underway
for a  facility  in  northeastern  Minnesota.  Any final  resource  decision  by
Minnesota Power is subject to MPUC and other approvals. We continue to study the
feasibility  of the  construction  of a natural  gas-fired  electric  generating
facility  which  could be  located in  northwestern  Wisconsin  or  northeastern
Minnesota.

Excelsior  Energy Inc.  (Excelsior)  has  proposed  to  construct a 600 MW (net)
coal-gasification  generation facility in northern Minnesota.  The project is in
the early development  stages but may be an option for our long-term  forecasted
energy and capacity  needs.  Excelsior says the facility could be operational in
2011,  but needs to obtain the necessary  permits and  financing.  In 2003,  the
Minnesota  legislature  enacted several  provisions that provide  Excelsior with
special  considerations,  including  requiring  utilities  within  the  state to
"consider" Excelsior before pursuing new resource additions within Minnesota. In
December 2005,  Excelsior filed a petition with the MPUC seeking  approval of an
unexecuted  power  purchase  agreement  with Xcel Energy  Inc. In January  2006,
Minnesota  Power filed  comments  with the MPUC in  Excelsior's  proposed  power
purchase  agreement  proceeding,  focusing  on the  importance  to the  state of
maintaining a range of base load energy  options  including  multiple fuel types
and generating technologies.

WIND POWER.  In 2005, we added a significant  resource to our Regulated  Utility
generation  portfolio  when we  entered  into a 25-year  agreement  to  purchase
approximately  50 MW of wind power from a new wind facility to be built in North
Dakota by an affiliate of FPL Energy, LLC. FPL Energy expects the facility to be
operational in the fall of 2006. The wind facility will include approximately 22
new wind turbines interconnected to the Square Butte substation in Center, North
Dakota.  The MPUC  approved the power  purchase  agreement in December  2005. In
addition,  we are  continuing to pursue the purchase of renewable  energy from a
new wind  facility  that would be located in northern  Minnesota.  This project,
expected to be operational in 2007, would be similar in size to the North Dakota
project  and  would  be  subject  to a  power  purchase  agreement,  as  well as
regulatory approvals.  The Minnesota project also needs to be operational by the
end of  2007 to be  eligible  for  federal  production  tax  credits  which  are
essential to provide acceptable pricing.

AREA PLAN. In October 2005, we announced a $60 million environmental  initiative
which is expected to  significantly  reduce  emissions  from two of our electric
generating facilities in northeastern Minnesota. Our Arrowhead Regional Emission
Abatement  (AREA) Plan is  designed  to reduce  emissions  while  maintaining  a
reliable and reasonably-priced energy supply to meet the needs of our customers.
We believe that control and  abatement  technologies  applicable to these plants
have matured to the point where further  significant air emission reductions can
be attained in a relatively cost-effective manner.

At  Taconite  Harbor,  we plan to  employ  innovative  multi-emission  reduction
technology,  while  at  Laskin  we plan to  install  a  retrofit  to  lower  NOX
emissions.  Upon project  completion,  we estimate an emission reduction of over
60% for NOX at both  facilities  and a 65% reduction in SO2 at Taconite  Harbor.
Laskin  already  has  relatively  low  emission  levels  of SO2 due to  existing
emission reduction technology.  Additionally, with the emerging technology being
proposed for Taconite  Harbor,  there is the  potential  for a 90%  reduction in
mercury emissions.

In  October  2005,  we filed the AREA plan  with the MPUC  followed  by a second
filing detailing  current cost recovery outside of a rate case in December 2005.
If approved  by the MPUC,  the rate impact on  residential  and general  service
customers is expected to be about 2% and about 3% for Large Power Customers when
the plan is fully  implemented at the end of 2008. We are seeking approval prior
to June 30, 2006, when the statutory  authorization for current cost recovery on
utility  emission  reduction  investments  sunsets.  In January  2006,  the MPCA
submitted its assessment of our AREA plan from an  environmental  perspective to
the MPUC.  The MPCA  supports  the plan as a  cost-effective  means of  reducing
emissions at Taconite Harbor and Laskin. Given the emission reduction that would
be achieved and the  reasonable  costs of the proposal,  the MPCA believes it is
appropriate to allow current cost recovery for this project.

OUTLOOK (CONTINUED)

CAIR AND CAMR.  In March  2005,  the EPA  issued its Clean Air  Interstate  Rule
(CAIR)  which would  reduce  emissions  of SO2 and NOX. In  November  2005,  EPA
granted  reconsideration  of  the  CAIR.  Minnesota  Power  filed  comments  for
reconsideration  arguing that the State of Minnesota  did not belong in CAIR and
that SO2  allocations  proposed  under the CAIR were  unfair.  The CAIR  comment
period  closed in January  2006 and a final rule is expected  in 2006.  In March
2005, EPA issued its Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR). EPA granted  reconsideration
of the CAMR in October  2005.  Comments  on  reconsideration  closed in December
2005. A final ruling on CAMR is anticipated in 2006. The final outcomes of these
regulatory  proceedings are expected to require  significant capital investments
in the 2008 to 2012 timeframe. (See Capital Requirements.)

ENERGY POLICY ACT. In August 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was signed into
law.  Key  provisions  in  the  law  include:   mandatory  electric  reliability
standards; FERC backstop siting authority for transmission corridors of national
interest,  as well as giving the U.S.  Department  of Energy (DOE) "lead agency"
authority to coordinate federal agencies involved in siting  transmission lines;
and the repeal of the PUHCA 1935 and the  enactment of PUHCA 2005.  The law also
reforms the hydro licensing process and supports the DOE's clean  coal/FutureGen
program.  We believe the overall impact on the electric utility industry will be
positive and are evaluating  the effects on our business as this  legislation is
being implemented.

INVESTMENT IN ATC. In 2005,  we announced  plans to invest $60 million in ATC by
the end of 2006.  Our  investment  will  represent  an  estimated  9%  ownership
interest  in ATC and is  expected  to be a  significant  contributor  to  future
earnings. Our investment in ATC is subject to review by the PSCW.

STRATEGY.  As part  of our  strategy,  we will  leverage  the  strengths  of our
Regulated  Utility  business to improve our strategic and financial  outlook and
seek growth  opportunities in close geographic  proximity to existing operations
in Minnesota,  North Dakota and Wisconsin.  In addition, we will evaluate growth
opportunities through merger, acquisition or asset additions in our region.

REAL ESTATE.  With an inventory of land in desirable Florida locations (see Item
1 - Real  Estate),  ALLETE  Properties  is poised for a growing  and  consistent
contribution  to  earnings  and cash flow.  A large  portion of our real  estate
inventory is located in Florida's Flagler and Volusia Counties, an area with one
of the  fastest  growing  populations  in the  United  States.  We  expect  this
population growth to continue, which will increase the demand for real estate in
the area.

We have three major planned  developments under way. They are Town Center, which
will be a new  downtown  for Palm Coast,  Palm Coast Park,  located in northwest
Palm Coast, and Ormond  Crossings,  located in Ormond Beach along Interstate 95.
As property within these developments is made available for sale, we expect that
these  projects  will  contribute  a  significant  amount of income for our real
estate  business.  Other  ongoing  land  sales and  rental  income at the retail
shopping center in Winter Haven provide additional revenue.

ALLETE  Properties plans to maximize the value of the property it currently owns
through entitlement and infrastructure improvements. In addition to managing its
current real estate  inventory,  ALLETE  Properties  is focused on  identifying,
acquiring and entitling vacant land in the coastal southeast United States.

As of December 31, 2005, we had $8.6 million of deferred profit on sales of real
estate, before taxes and minority interest, on our balance sheet. We expect most
of this deferred profit will be reflected in income during the next 12 months.

TOWN CENTER.  Ground was broken on the Town Center development in early 2005. At
December 31,  2005,  pending land sales under  contract for  properties  at Town
Center totaled $63.7 million.  Florida Landmark has an agreement with Developers
Realty  Corporation  (DRC) to develop  the first phase of the urban core area of
Town Center. The agreement also includes the development of a 51-acre commercial
retail site.  Revenue  associated with this agreement is anticipated to be $21.8
million over the life of the contract, which extends to September 2012.

During the initial  phase of the Town Center  project,  our primary  focus is to
develop the major  infrastructure,  most of the development  tracts,  as well as
plat  lots  for a  variety  of uses.  The  marketing  program  has  targeted  an
appropriate blend and quantity of office, commercial,  residential and mixed-use
projects.  Sites for all land uses that are  planned  in the  initial  phase are
already sold or under contract, except adult housing.  Negotiations are underway
with several  developers that specialize in adult housing units.  After the next
few years,  once the market has  substantially  absorbed  the land uses that are
currently  in the design  phase,  additional  sites will be released for sale in
order to maintain an orderly build-out of Town Center. Pacing the growth of Town
Center  consistent with absorption rates for each unit type will assure that our
customers,  the Town Center  project  developers,  will be  successful.  This is
expected  to  create  and  maximize  value  for the  developers,  end-users  and
investors.

OUTLOOK (CONTINUED)

PALM COAST PARK.  Designing has been  completed and  permitting is proceeding on
the Palm Coast Park  development,  with  infrastructure  construction  slated to
begin in 2006.  Development  order  approval  from  the City of Palm  Coast  was
received in late 2005. Also in 2005, the State of Florida granted the Palm Coast
Park  Community  Development  District  authority  to issue  special  assessment
revenue  bonds  to fund  construction  of  infrastructure  improvements  for the
project.  The bonds are expected to be issued by the  district by mid 2006.  The
major  infrastructure  improvements,  consisting primarily of utility extensions
and a linear park along the U.S.  Highway 1  frontage,  are being  permitted  in
anticipation   of  this  bond  financing,   after  which   construction  of  the
improvements will commence. Platting is underway and expected to be completed in
early 2007.  Commercial  sites will be available for sale  beginning in 2007. At
December 31,  2005,  pending land sales under  contract for  properties  at Palm
Coast Park totaled  $7.5  million.  Negotiations  are underway to sell two other
residential development tracts.

ORMOND  CROSSINGS.  In 2005, a Development of Regional Impact (DRI)  Application
for  Development  Approval was  submitted to the East Central  Florida  Regional
Planning Council for the 6,000-acre Ormond Crossings  project.  Development uses
and  densities  proposed in the DRI include 5 million  square feet of commercial
opportunities  along with up to 4,400 residential  units. We anticipate that the
DRI review will be concluded and a development  order will be issued by the City
of Ormond  Beach by the end of 2006.  Engineering,  design and  permitting  will
continue  through  2007.  It is not  anticipated  that any sales will be made at
Ormond Crossings until 2008. The Ormond Crossings DRI application represents the
launch of our third major real estate  development in Florida and the largest in
terms of available commercial square feet and residential units.

OTHER.  We have  the  potential  to  recognize  gains or  losses  on the sale of
investments in our emerging technology portfolio. We plan to sell investments in
our  emerging  technology  portfolio  as  shares  are  distributed  to us.  Some
restrictions  on sales may apply,  including,  but not limited  to,  underwriter
lock-up  periods that typically  extend for 180 days following an initial public
offering.  We have committed to make additional  investments in certain emerging
technology  holdings.  The total future  commitment was $3.1 million at December
31, 2005,  and is expected to be invested at various  times  through 2007. We do
not have plans to make any additional investments beyond this commitment.

DIVERSIFICATION.  We have a long history of both acquiring and selling companies
in a variety of industries,  and these activities have contributed significantly
to overall financial  results.  We will seek to diversify our earnings stream to
mitigate  potential  downside exposure to industrial  customers in our Regulated
Utility business and to provide additional earnings growth.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES

A primary goal of our  strategic  plan is to improve cash flow from  operations.
Our  strategy  includes  growing our  businesses  both  internally  by expanding
facilities,  services and operations (see Capital Requirements),  and externally
through acquisitions.

We believe our  financial  condition  is strong,  as  evidenced by cash and cash
equivalents of $89.6 million,  $116.9  million of short-term  investments  and a
debt to total capital ratio of 39% at December 31, 2005.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  Cash flow from operating activities was $53.5 million for
2005 ($175.0  million for 2004;  $247.4  million for 2003).  Cash from operating
activities  was  lower  in  2005,  primarily  due to the  absence  of cash  from
discontinued  operations ($2.3 million in 2005;  $108.8 million in 2004;  $133.3
million in 2003).  In 2004,  we spun off our  Automotive  Services  business and
essentially  completed the exit from our Water  Services  businesses.  Cash from
operating  activities  was also  lower in 2005  due to a $50.4  million  Kendall
County Charge in 2005. In 2005,  cash from operating  activities was higher than
in 2004 due to the  collection  in January  2005 of a $6.7  million  outstanding
receivable  at  December  31,  2004,  from ATC for work on the  Duluth-to-Wausau
transmission  line and other  receivables,  and an  additional  $7.5  million of
deferred  profit on real estate  activities.  Cash from operating  activities in
2003  included the receipt of a $20.9  million  outstanding  receivable  in 2002
related  to a  turbine  generator  sold  following  the  indefinite  delay  of a
generation project in Superior, Wisconsin.

INVESTING  ACTIVITIES.  Cash flow from investing activities was $3.9 million for
2005 (cash flow for investing  activities of $126.5 million for 2004;  cash flow
from  investing  activities  of $210.3  million for 2003).  Cash from  investing
activities  was  higher in 2005 than  2004,  primarily  due to a $179.9  million
increase in net proceeds received from the sale of short-term investments. Gross
proceeds from the sale of  available-for-sale  securities were $376.0 million in
2005 ($1.9  million in 2004;  $7.4  million in 2003) and  purchases  were $343.7
million ($149.5 million in 2004; $0 in 2003). Cash from investing activities for
2005 was also higher by $35.5  million  from the sale of Enventis  Telecom.  The
increase was offset by $66.0 million proceeds  received in 2004 from the sale of
our remaining Water Services  businesses.  The increase was also offset by $12.0
million  received from Split Rock Energy in 2004 upon  termination  of the joint
venture.  Additions  to  property,  plant and  equipment  vary from year to year
depending on special  projects.  Additions to property,  plant and  equipment in
2003 included  expenses related to BNI Coal's dragline  project.  Cash flow from
investing  activities was lower in 2004 than 2003, primarily due to purchases of
available-for-sales  securities  in 2004 ($149.5  million) and $445  million  of
proceeds received in 2003 from the sale of a major portion of our Water Services
businesses.

FINANCING  ACTIVITIES.  Cash flow for financing activities was $13.9 million for
2005 ($228.7  million for 2004;  $470.7 million for 2003).  The decrease in cash
for financing  activities was primarily attributed to significant debt repayment
($35.7  million in 2005;  $241.1 million in 2004;  $335.7  million in 2003).  In
2005,  we  refinanced  $35 million of first  mortgage  bonds at a lower rate. In
2004,  we repaid $3.5 million of industrial  development  revenue bonds and $125
million of senior  notes,  and  refinanced  $111  million of  pollution  control
refunding revenue bonds at a lower rate. In 2003, we repaid $75 million of first
mortgage bonds and $75 million of mandatorily  redeemable preferred  securities.
In addition,  a $250 million credit agreement entered into in July 2003 was paid
off early ($197 million in 2003;  $53 million in April 2004).  Proceeds from the
sale of our Water Services  assets in 2003 and 2004, and proceeds  received from
ADESA in 2004 were used to repay the debt in 2003 and 2004.  Cash for  financing
activities also decreased in 2005 and 2004 due to lower dividends paid following
the spin-off of Automotive Services.

Our  Town  Center  development  project  in  Florida  is being  financed  with a
revolving  development  loan and  tax-exempt  bonds issued by the Town Center at
Palm Coast Community Development District (Town Center District). In March 2005,
Florida  Landmark entered into an $8.5 million  revolving  development loan with
CypressCoquina Bank to fund approximately $26 million of Town Center development
costs.  The loan has an interest  rate equal to the prime rate,  with an initial
term of 36  months.  The term of the loan may be  extended  24 months if certain
conditions  are met. Also in March 2005, the Town Center  District  issued $26.4
million of tax-exempt,  6% Capital  Improvement  Revenue Bonds, Series 2005, due
May 1, 2036 (Bonds). Approximately $21 million of the Bond proceeds will be used
for  construction  of  infrastructure  improvements  at Town  Center,  with  the
remaining funds to be used for capitalized interest, a debt service reserve fund
and costs of  issuance.  The Bonds are  payable  from and secured by the revenue
derived from assessments to be imposed,  levied and collected by the Town Center
District.   The  assessments  represent  an  allocation  of  the  costs  of  the
improvements,  including  bond  financing  costs,  to the lands  within the Town
Center  District  benefiting  from the  improvements.  The  assessments  will be
included  in the annual  property  tax bills of  landowners  in the  development
project  beginning in November 2006. To the extent that we still own land at the
time of the assessment, we will recognize an expense for our pro rata portion of
assessments,  based upon our  ownership of benefited  property.  At December 31,
2005,  we owned  approximately  92% of the  assessable  land in the Town  Center
District.  The Town Center District is an independent unit of local  government,
created  and  established  in  accordance  with  Florida's   Uniform   Community
Development  District Act of 1980 (Act).  The Act provides legal authority for a
community   development   district   to  finance  the   construction   of  major
infrastructure for community  development with general  obligation,  revenue and
special assessment revenue debt obligations.

WORKING CAPITAL.  Additional working capital,  if and when needed,  generally is
provided by the sale of commercial  paper.  We have 0.8 million  original  issue
shares of our common stock  available for issuance  through INVEST  DIRECT,  our
direct  stock  purchase and dividend  reinvestment  plan.  We have bank lines of
credit aggregating $170.0 million, the majority of which expire in January 2011.
In January  2006, we renewed,  increased  and extended a committed,  syndicated,
unsecured revolving credit facility with LaSalle Bank National  Association,  as
Agent,  for $150 million  (Line).  The Line matures on January 11, 2011.  At our
request and subject to certain  conditions,  the Line may be  increased  to $200
million and extended for two additional  12-month periods. We may prepay amounts
outstanding under the Line in whole or in part at our discretion.  Additionally,
we may  irrevocably  terminate or reduce the size of the Line prior to maturity.
The Line may be used for  general  corporate  purposes,  working  capital and to
provide  liquidity in support of our commercial  paper  program.  The amount and
timing of future sales of our securities will depend upon market  conditions and
our specific  needs.  We may sell  securities to meet capital  requirements,  to
provide for the retirement or early  redemption of issues of long-term  debt, to
reduce short-term debt and for other corporate purposes.

SALE OF ENVENTIS TELECOM.  In 2005, we sold all the stock of Enventis Telecom to
HickoryTech of Mankato,  Minnesota,  for $35.5 million. The transaction resulted
in an after-tax  loss of $3.6  million,  which was included in our 2005 earnings
from  discontinued  operations.  Net cash  proceeds  realized from the sale were
approximately $29 million after transaction costs, repayment of debt and payment
of income taxes.

SECURITIES

In March 2001, ALLETE, ALLETE Capital II and ALLETE Capital III, jointly filed a
registration  statement with the SEC,  pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities
Act of 1933. The registration  statement,  which has been declared  effective by
the SEC,  relates to the possible  issuance of a remaining  aggregate  amount of
$387  million of  securities,  which may  include  ALLETE  common  stock,  first
mortgage  bonds and other  debt  securities,  and  ALLETE  Capital II and ALLETE
Capital  III  preferred  trust  securities.   ALLETE  also  previously  filed  a
registration  statement,  which has been declared effective by the SEC, relating
to the possible  issuance of $25 million of first  mortgage bonds and other debt
securities.  We may sell all or a portion of the remaining registered securities
if warranted by market  conditions and our capital  requirements.  Any offer and
sale  of the  above  mentioned  securities  will  be made  only  by  means  of a
prospectus  meeting the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules
and regulations thereunder.

In August  2005,  we issued $35 million in  principal  amount of First  Mortgage
Bonds,  5.28% due 2020.  Proceeds  were used to redeem $35 million in  principal
amount of First Mortgage Bonds, 7 1/2% Series originally due 2007.

<PAGE>


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (CONTINUED)

In October 2005, we accepted an offer from certain  institutional  buyers in the
private  placement  market to purchase  $50 million in  principal  amount of our
first  mortgage  bonds.  When issued,  on or about March 1, 2006, the bonds will
carry an interest rate of 5.69% and will have a term of 30 years. On January 30,
2006, we called for redemption on March 2, 2006, $50 million in principal amount
of First Mortgage Bonds, 7% Series due 2008.

FINANCIAL COVENANTS

Our lines of credit and  letters of credit  supporting  certain  long-term  debt
arrangements contain financial covenants. The most restrictive covenant requires
ALLETE to maintain a quarterly ratio of its funded debt to total capital of less
than or equal to .65 to 1.00.  Failure to meet this covenant  could give rise to
an event of default,  if not  corrected  after notice from the lender,  in which
event ALLETE may need to pursue alternative sources of funding. Some of ALLETE's
debt  arrangements  contain  "cross-default"  provisions that would result in an
event of default if there is a failure  under other  financing  arrangements  to
meet  payment  terms or to  observe  other  covenants  that  would  result in an
acceleration of payments due. As of December 31, 2005,  ALLETE was in compliance
with its financial covenants.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in Note 10.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

Our long-term debt  obligations,  including  long-term debt due within one year,
represent the principal  amount of bonds,  notes and loans which are recorded on
our  consolidated  balance  sheet,  plus  interest.  The table below assumes the
interest  rate in effect at December  31,  2005,  remains  constant  through the
remaining term.

Unconditional  purchase  obligations  represent our Square Butte power  purchase
agreement, and minimum purchase commitments under coal and rail contracts.

Under our power purchase  agreement with Square Butte that extends through 2026,
we are obligated to pay our pro rata share of Square  Butte's costs based on our
entitlement  to the output of Square Butte's 455 MW coal-fired  generating  unit
near Center,  North Dakota.  Our payment obligation is suspended if Square Butte
fails to deliver any power,  whether produced or purchased,  for a period of one
year.  Square  Butte's  fixed  costs  consist  primarily  of debt  service.  The
following  table  reflects our share of future debt service  based on our output
entitlement of approximately  66% in 2006, 60% in 2007 and 55% thereafter.  Upon
compliance with a two-year  advance notice  requirement,  Minnkota Power has the
option to reduce our entitlement by approximately  5% annually,  to a minimum of
50%. (See Note 10.)

Under  an  agreement  with  Wisconsin   Public  Service   Corporation   and  WPS
Investments,  LLC, we have a commitment  to invest $60 million in ATC by the end
of 2006.  (See Note 10.) Our investment will represent an estimated 9% ownership
interest in ATC. Our investment in ATC is subject to review by the PSCW.

EMERGING  TECHNOLOGY  PORTFOLIO.  We have  investments in emerging  technologies
through the minority  investments in venture  capital funds and  privately-held,
start-up companies.  We have committed to make additional investments in certain
emerging  technology  holdings.  The total future commitment was $3.1 million at
December 31, 2005 ($4.5  million at December 31, 2004;  $4.8 million at December
31, 2003) and is expected to be invested at various  times  through  2007. We do
not have plans to make any additional investments beyond this commitment.

CREDIT RATINGS

Our  securities  have been rated by  Standard & Poor's  and by  Moody's.  Rating
agencies  use both  quantitative  and  qualitative  measures  in  determining  a
company's credit rating.  These measures include business risk,  liquidity risk,
competitive position,  capital mix, financial condition,  predictability of cash
flows,  management  strength  and  future  direction.  Some of the  quantitative
measures  can  be  analyzed  through  a few  key  financial  ratios,  while  the
qualitative ones are more subjective.  The disclosure of these credit ratings is
not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our securities. Ratings are subject to
revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning  rating  organization.  Each
rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

PAYOUT RATIO

In 2005, we paid out 259% (77% in 2004;  40% in 2003) of our per share  earnings
in dividends. The payout ratio in 2005 was impacted by a $1.84 per diluted share
charge to assign the Kendall  County power purchase  agreement to  Constellation
Energy Commodities in April 2005. (See Note 11.)

On January 25,  2006,  our Board of Directors  increased  the dividend on ALLETE
common stock by 15%, declaring a dividend of 36.25 cents per share payable March
1, 2006, to shareholders of record at the close of business February 15, 2006.


CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

CONTINUING  OPERATIONS.  Capital  expenditures  for 2005 totaled  $58.6  million
($57.8 million in 2004;  $68.7 million in 2003).  Expenditures for 2005 included
$46.5 million for Regulated  Utility and $12.1 million for  Nonregulated  Energy
Operations.  Internally-generated  funds were the  source of  funding  for these
expenditures.

Capital  expenditures  are  expected  to be $107  million in 2006 and total $630
million for 2007 through 2010. The 2006 amount  includes $105 million for system
component replacement and upgrades,  and environmental upgrades within Regulated
Utility,  and $2  million  for coal  handling  equipment  and  system  component
replacement,  and upgrades within  Nonregulated  Energy Operations.  Starting in
2006,  Taconite  Harbor's capital  expenditures  will be combined with Regulated
Utility   expenditures.   Over  the  next   five   years,   we   expect  to  use
internally-generated  funds and new  issue  debt to fund our  projected  capital
expenditures.  Approximately $280 million of the estimated expenditures for 2007
through  2010 relate to  environmental  upgrades at our  generation  facilities,
primarily  due  to  the   promulgation  of  two  new  EPA  rules  in  2005.  Our
environmental  compliance  plan  incorporates  a combination  of solutions  that
include  both  technology  and  emission  allowance  purchases,  and  timing and
scheduling of environmental retrofit during this period.

Real  estate  development  expenditures  are and will be funded with a revolving
development loan and tax-exempt bonds issued by community development districts.
The Town  Center at Palm  Coast  Community  Development  District  issued  $26.4
million  of  tax-exempt  bonds in 2005.  Approximately  $21  million of the bond
proceeds will be used for  construction of  infrastructure  improvements at Town
Center,  with the remaining  funds to be used for capitalized  interest,  a debt
service  reserve fund and costs of issuance.  We anticipate  that the Palm Coast
Park  Community  Development  District  will  issue  tax-exempt  bonds  to  fund
construction of  infrastructure  improvements for our Palm Coast Park project in
mid-2006.  Expenditures  related  to our real  estate  developments  in  Florida
increase the value of our land assets,  which are  classified as  Investments on
our consolidated balance sheet.

DISCONTINUED  OPERATIONS.  Capital expenditures for discontinued  operations for
2005  totaled  $4.5  million  ($21.4  million in 2004;  $67.6  million in 2003).
Expenditures for 2005 related to our telecommunications business.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS

As  previously  mentioned  in our  Critical  Accounting  Policies  section,  our
businesses  are  subject  to  regulation  of  environmental  matters  by various
federal,  state and local  authorities.  Due to  future  stricter  environmental
requirements through legislation and/or rulemaking, we anticipate that potential
expenditures  for  environmental  matters  will be  material  and  will  require
significant  capital  investments.  We are unable to predict  the outcome of the
issues discussed in Note 10. (See Item 1 - Environmental Matters.)


MARKET RISK

SECURITIES INVESTMENTS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE  SECURITIES.  At December  31, 2005,  our  available-for-sale
securities  portfolio  consisted of securities in a grantor trust established to
fund certain employee benefits included in Investments, and various auction rate
municipal bonds and variable rate municipal  demand notes included as Short-Term
Investments.  Our  available-for-sale  securities  portfolio had a fair value of
$139.5 million at December 31, 2005 ($179.4  million at December 31, 2004) and a
total  unrealized  after-tax  gain of $2.1  million at  December  31, 2005 ($1.5
million at December 31, 2004).

We use the specific  identification method as the basis for determining the cost
of   securities   sold.   Our  policy  is  to  review  on  a   quarterly   basis
available-for-sale  securities for other than temporary  impairment by assessing
such  factors  as the  share  price  trends  and the  impact of  overall  market
conditions.  As a result of our  periodic  assessments,  we did not  record  any
impairment of available-for-sale securities in 2005 or 2004.

EMERGING TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO.  As part of our emerging technology portfolio, we
have  several   minority   investments  in  venture  capital  funds  and  direct
investments in privately-held, start-up companies. We account for our investment
in venture  capital  funds  under the equity  method and  account for our direct
investment  in  privately-held  companies  under the cost method  because of our
ownership  percentage.  The  total  carrying  value of our  emerging  technology
portfolio  was $9.2 million at December 31, 2005 ($13.6  million at December 31,
2004).  Our policy is to review these  investments  quarterly for  impairment by
assessing such factors as continued commercial viability of products,  cash flow
and earnings.  Any impairment would reduce the carrying value of the investment.
Our basis in direct  investments  in  privately-held  companies  included in the
emerging  technology  portfolio  was zero at December 31, 2005 ($4.5  million at
December 31,  2004).  In 2005, we recorded $5.1 million ($3.3 million after tax)
of impairments  that related to direct  investments  in certain  privately-held,
start-up companies whose future business prospects had significantly diminished.
Developments at these companies  indicated that future commercial  viability was
unlikely,  as was new financing necessary to continue  development.  In 2004, we
recorded $6.5 million ($4.1 million after tax) of impairments. We did not record
any impairments in 2003.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

Our regulated utility operations in Minnesota and Wisconsin incur costs for fuel
(primarily  coal),  power and natural gas  purchased for resale in our regulated
service  territories,  and  related  transportation.  Our  regulated  utilities'
exposure to price risk for these  commodities is significantly  mitigated by the
current ratemaking process and regulatory environment,  which generally allows a
fuel clause  surcharge  if costs are in excess of those in our last rate filing.
Conversely,  costs below those in our last rate filing  result in a rate credit.
We seek to prudently  manage our  customers'  exposure to price risk by entering
into contracts of various durations and terms for the purchase of coal and power
(in Minnesota), power and natural gas (in Wisconsin), and related transportation
costs.

MARKET RISK (CONTINUED)

POWER MARKETING

Our power marketing activities consist of (1) purchasing energy in the wholesale
market  for resale in our  regulated  service  territories  when  retail  energy
requirements   exceed  generation  output,  and  (2)  selling  excess  available
generation and purchased power.

From time to time,  our utility  operations may have excess  generation  that is
temporarily  not required by retail and  municipal  customers  in our  regulated
service  territory.  We actively sell this generation to the wholesale market to
optimize the value of our generating  facilities.  This  generation is generally
sold in the MISO market at market prices.

We have  approximately 200 MW of generation  available for sale to the wholesale
markets at our Taconite  Harbor facility in northern  Minnesota,  which has been
sold through  various  short-term and long-term  capacity and energy  contracts.
Approximately  116 MW of existing capacity and energy sales contracts expired on
April 30,  2005.  Long-term,  we have entered into two capacity and energy sales
contracts totaling 175 MW (201 MW including a 15% reserve), which were effective
May 1, 2005, and expire on April 30, 2010. Both contracts  contain fixed monthly
capacity charges and fixed minimum energy charges.  One contract provides for an
annual  escalator  to the energy  charge based on increases in our cost of coal,
subject to a small minimum annual  escalation.  The other contract provides that
the energy  charge  will be the greater of a fixed  minimum  charge or an amount
based on the variable production cost of a combined-cycle, natural gas unit. Our
exposure  in the  event  of a full or  partial  outage  at our  Taconite  Harbor
facility  is  significantly  limited  under  both  contracts.  When the buyer is
notified at least two months prior to an outage,  there is no exposure.  Outages
with less than two months' notice are subject to an annual  duration  limitation
typical of this type of contract. We also have a 50 MW capacity and energy sales
contract that extends  through April 2008 and a 15 MW energy sales contract that
extends through May 2007. The 50 MW capacity and energy sales contract had fixed
pricing through January 2006, with formula pricing based on variable  production
cost of a combustion-turbine, natural gas unit thereafter.

In  addition  to  generation,  Taconite  Harbor  will  meet its  sales  contract
obligations  with two contracts that began in May 2005. We have a 50 MW capacity
and energy  purchase  contract  that  extends  through  April  2006,  with fixed
capacity  payments and the right to purchase energy at market price. We also had
a 25 MW  fixed-priced  energy  purchase  contract that extended  through January
2006.

ITEM 9A.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

CONCLUSION REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the supervision and with the  participation  of our management,  including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of our disclosure  controls and  procedures,  as such term is defined
under Rule 13a-15(e)  promulgated under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the Exchange Act).  Based on this evaluation,  our principal  executive
officer  and our  principal  financial  officer  concluded  that our  disclosure
controls and  procedures  were  effective as of the end of the period covered by
this annual report.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial  reporting,  as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(f).  Under the supervision and with the  participation of our management,
including our principal  executive officer and principal  financial officer,  we
conducted  an  evaluation  of the  effectiveness  of our  internal  control over
financial  reporting  based on the  framework  in  Internal  Control--Integrated
Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations  of the Treadway
Commission.   Based  on  our   evaluation   under  the   framework  in  Internal
Control--Integrated  Framework,  our  management  concluded  that  our  internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005.

Our  management's  assessment of the  effectiveness of our internal control over
financial   reporting   as  of  December   31,   2005,   has  been   audited  by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of ALLETE, Inc.

We have completed integrated audits of ALLETE, Inc.'s 2005 and 2004 consolidated
financial  statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company  Accounting  Oversight Board
(United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
------------------------------------------------------------------

In our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  listed  in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(1)  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the
financial position of ALLETE, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and
2004,  and the results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity  with accounting
principles  generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,  in
our opinion,  the financial  statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material  respects,  the information
set  forth  therein  when  read in  conjunction  with the  related  consolidated
financial  statements.   These  financial  statements  and  financial  statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial  statements and financial  statement
schedule  based on our audits.  We conducted  our audits of these  statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company  Accounting  Oversight Board
(United States).  Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements,  assessing the accounting  principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated  financial  statements,  in 2004 the
Company  changed its method of accounting for  investments in limited  liability
companies in accordance with EITF 03-16,  "Accounting for Investments in Limited
Liability Companies."

Internal control over financial reporting
-----------------------------------------

Also, in our opinion,  management's assessment,  included in Management's Report
on Internal Control Over Financial  Reporting  appearing under Item 9A, that the
Company  maintained  effective  internal control over financial  reporting as of
December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal  Control--Integrated
Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations  of the Treadway
Commission  (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material  respects,  based on those
criteria.  Furthermore,  in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on criteria  established in Internal  Control--Integrated  Framework
issued by the COSO.  The Company's  management is  responsible  for  maintaining
effective  internal  control over financial  reporting and for its assessment of
the   effectiveness   of  internal   control  over  financial   reporting.   Our
responsibility  is to express  opinions on  management's  assessment  and on the
effectiveness of the Company's  internal control over financial  reporting based
on our  audit.  We  conducted  our  audit of  internal  control  over  financial
reporting in  accordance  with the  standards of the Public  Company  Accounting
Oversight  Board  (United  States).  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform  the  audit to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all  material
respects.  An  audit of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes
obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,
evaluating  management's  assessment,  testing  and  evaluating  the  design and
operating   effectiveness  of  internal  control,   and  performing  such  other
procedures as we consider  necessary in the  circumstances.  We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's  internal control over financial  reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting
and the preparation of financial  statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial  reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the  maintenance  of records that, in reasonable  detail,  accurately and fairly
reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions of the assets of the company;  (ii)
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company;  and (iii) provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or
timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In 2005,  we began  allocating  corporate  charges and  interest  expense to our
business segments.  For comparative  purposes,  segment information for 2004 and
2003 has been  restated  to reflect the new  allocation  method used in 2005 for
corporate  charges  and  interest  expense.  This  restatement  had no impact on

NOTE 2.    OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

FINANCIAL  STATEMENT  PREPARATION.  References  in this report to "we," "us" and
"our" are to ALLETE and its subsidiaries, collectively. We prepare our financial
statements in conformity with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
United States of America.  These principles  require management to make informed
judgments,  best estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of
assets,  liabilities,  revenue and  expenses.  Actual  results could differ from
those estimates.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION.  Our consolidated  financial statements include the
accounts  of ALLETE  and all of our  majority-owned  subsidiary  companies.  All
material   intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated  in
consolidation.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years' amounts
to  conform  to  current  year  classifications.  We  revised  our  Consolidated
Statement  of Cash Flows for the years  ended  December  31,  2004 and 2003,  to
reconcile  Net  Income  to  Cash  from  Operating  Activities.   Previously,  we
reconciled Income from Continuing  Operations to Cash from Operating Activities.
In addition,  we have reclassified  certain amounts in our balance sheet, income
statement, cash flows and segment information to reflect discontinued operations
treatment   for   the   sale   of   our   telecommunications   business.   These
reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net income, shareholders'
equity, comprehensive income or cash flows.

REVISION IN THE  CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN  SECURITIES.  In the quarterly period
ended June 30, 2005, we concluded  that it was  appropriate  to  reclassify  our
auction  rate  municipal  bonds and  variable  rate  municipal  demand  notes as
short-term investments. Previously, such investments had been classified as cash
and cash equivalents.  Accordingly, we now report these securities as short-term
investments  in a separate  line item on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet as of
December  31,  2004.  We  have  also  made  corresponding   adjustments  to  our
Consolidated  Statement of Cash Flows for the period ended December 31, 2004, to
reflect  the  gross  purchases  and  sales  of  these  securities  as  investing
activities rather than as a component of cash and cash equivalents.  This change
in  classification  does  not  affect  our  previously   reported   Consolidated
Statements of Income for any period.

For the year ended  December  31, 2004,  net cash used in  investing  activities
related to these  short-term  investments of $149.2 million was included in cash
and cash equivalents in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

BUSINESS  SEGMENTS.  Our Regulated Utility,  Nonregulated  Energy Operations and
Real Estate segments were determined based on products and services provided and
the manner in which we monitor and manage the business.  We measure  performance
of  our  operations   through  budgeting  and  monitoring  of  contributions  to
consolidated  net  income  by each  business  segment.  Discontinued  Operations
includes our  telecommunications  business,  which we sold on December 30, 2005,
our  Automotive  Services  business that was spun off in September  2004,  costs
associated with the spin-off of ADESA incurred by ALLETE, and our Water Services
businesses, the majority of which were sold in 2003.

was received from one taconite  producer in 2005 (12.6% in 2004; 10.0% in 2003).
Regulated  utility rates are under the jurisdiction of various state and federal
regulatory  authorities.  Billings  are  rendered on a cycle  basis.  Revenue is
accrued for service  provided but not billed.  Regulated  utility electric rates
include  adjustment clauses that bill or credit customers for fuel and purchased
energy  costs  above or below the base  levels in rate  schedules  and that bill
retail   customers  for  the  recovery  of  conservation   improvement   program
expenditures not collected in base rates.

Minnesota  Power  withdrew  from Split Rock Energy,  a joint  venture with Great
River Energy, in 2004. Upon withdrawal, we received a $12.0 million distribution
in 2004. We accounted for our 50% ownership  interest in Split Rock Energy under
the equity  method of  accounting.  For the year ended  December 31,  2004,  our
pre-tax  equity  income from Split Rock Energy was less than $0.1 million  ($2.9
million in 2003). In 2004, prior to our withdrawal, we made power purchases from
Split Rock  Energy of $6.2  million  ($50.9  million in 2003) and power sales to
Split Rock Energy of $1.9 million ($19.6 million in 2003).

NONREGULATED  ENERGY  OPERATIONS  includes our coal mining  activities  in North
Dakota  and   nonregulated   generation   (non-rate  base   generation  sold  at
market-based  rates to the wholesale  market)  consisting  primarily of Taconite
Harbor in northern  Minnesota.  Pending MPUC approval,  Taconite  Harbor will be
integrated into our Regulated Utility business effective  retroactive to January
1, 2006, to help meet  forecasted  base load energy  requirements.  Nonregulated
generation  also included  generation  secured  through the Kendall County power
purchase  agreement,  which was assigned to Constellation  Energy Commodities in
April 2005. (See Note 11.)

REAL  ESTATE  includes  our  Florida  real  estate  operations.  Our real estate
operations  include several  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  and an 80% ownership in
Lehigh  Acquisition  Corporation,  which are consolidated in ALLETE's  financial
statements.  All of our Florida real estate companies are principally engaged in
real estate acquisitions, development and sales.

Full  profit  recognition  is  recorded  on sales upon  closing,  provided  cash
collections are at least 20% of the contract price and the other requirements of
SFAS 66, "Accounting for Sales of Real Estate," are met. In certain cases, where
there are obligations to perform  significant  development  activities after the
date of  sale,  we  recognize  profit  on a  percentage-of-completion  basis  in
accordance with SFAS 66. Pursuant to this method of accounting,  gross profit is
recognized based upon the relationship of development  costs incurred as of that
date to the total estimated costs to develop the parcels,  including all related
amenities or common costs of the entire project. Revenue and cost of real estate
sold in excess of the amount  recognized  based on the  percentage-of-completion
method is deferred and recognized as revenue and cost of real estate sold during
the period in which the related development costs are incurred. Revenue and cost
of real estate sold are recorded net as Deferred  Profit on Sales of Real Estate
on our consolidated balance sheet.

Traffic impact fee credits are provided to the developer as mitigation  payments
are made to the city. We are reimbursed  after the land is sold and a subsequent
property  owner  constructs  vertical  improvements  on the site.  We  recognize
revenue resulting from these reimbursed fees when they are received.

Land held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value  determined by
the evaluation of individual  land parcels and is included in Investments on our
consolidated balance sheet. Real estate costs include the cost of land acquired,
subsequent development costs and costs of improvements,  capitalized development
period  interest,  real  estate  taxes and  payroll  costs of certain  employees
devoted directly to the development effort. These real estate costs incurred are
capitalized  to the cost of real estate  parcels  based upon the relative  sales
value of parcels  within each  development  project in accordance  with SFAS 67,
"Accounting  for Costs and Initial Rental  Operations of Real Estate  Projects."
When real estate is sold, the cost of real estate sold includes the actual costs
incurred  and the  estimate of future  completion  costs  allocated  to the real
estate sold based upon the relative sales value method.

Whenever  events or  circumstances  indicate that the carrying value of the real
estate may not be  recoverable,  impairments  would be recorded  and the related
assets would be adjusted to their estimated fair value, less costs to sell.

OTHER includes investments in emerging technologies,  and earnings on cash, cash
equivalents  and  short-term  investments.  As part of our  emerging  technology
portfolio,  we have several  minority  investments in venture  capital funds and
direct investments in  privately-held,  start-up  companies.  We account for our
investment in venture  capital funds under the equity method and account for our
direct investment in  privately-held  companies under the cost method because of
our  ownership  percentage.  Short-term  investments  consist  of  auction  rate
municipal bonds and variable rate municipal  demand notes, and are classified as
available-for-sale  securities.  All  income  generated  from  these  short-term
investments is recorded as interest income.

NOTE 2.    OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. Property,  plant  and  equipment  are recorded at
original  cost  and  are  reported  on the  balance  sheet  net  of  accumulated
depreciation.  Expenditures  for  additions  and  significant  replacements  and
improvements  are  capitalized;  maintenance  and repair  costs are  expensed as
incurred.  Expenditures  for major plant  overhauls are also accounted for using
this same policy. Gains or losses on nonregulated property,  plant and equipment
are  recognized  when they are retired or  otherwise  disposed.  When  regulated
utility property, plant and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed, no gain
or loss is  recognized,  pursuant  to SFAS 71,  "Accounting  for the  Effects of
Certain Types of Regulations."  Our Regulated Utility  operations  capitalize an
allowance for funds used during  construction,  which  includes both an interest
and  equity  component.  Our  other  operations  capitalize  interest  during  a
construction project.

LONG-LIVED  ASSET   IMPAIRMENTS.   We  account  for  our  long-lived  assets  at
depreciated  historical  cost. A long-lived  asset is tested for  recoverability
whenever  events or changes in  circumstances  indicate that its carrying amount
may not be recoverable.  We conduct this assessment using SFAS 144,  "Accounting
for  the   Impairment  and  Disposal  of  Long-Lived   Assets."   Judgments  and
uncertainties  affecting  the  application  of accounting  for asset  impairment
include economic conditions affecting market valuations, changes in our business
strategy,  and  changes  in our  forecast  of future  operating  cash  flows and
earnings. We would recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a
long-lived  asset is not recoverable  from its  undiscounted  future cash flows.
Management  judgment is involved in both deciding if testing for  recoverability
is necessary and in estimating undiscounted cash flows.

ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE.  Accounts receivable are reported on the balance sheet net
of an allowance for doubtful accounts.  The allowance is based on our evaluation
of the receivable portfolio under current conditions, the size of the portfolio,
overall  portfolio  quality,  review of specific problems and such other factors
that, in our judgment, deserve recognition in estimating losses.

UNAMORTIZED EXPENSE,  DISCOUNT AND PREMIUM ON DEBT. Discount and premium on debt

the effective interest method.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  We consider all investments  purchased with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

RESTRICTED  CASH. We sponsor a leveraged ESOP as part of our Retirement  Savings
and Stock  Ownership  Plan. At December 31, 2004,  the ESOP had $30.3 million in
cash,  which was used to purchase  ALLETE common stock on the open market during
2005.  We  reflected  the  cash  held  by the  ESOP  as  Restricted  Cash on our
consolidated  balance  sheet.  (See Note 18.)  There was no  restricted  cash at
December 31, 2005.

ACCOUNTING  FOR  STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION.  We  have  elected  to  account  for
stock-based compensation under the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB
Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees."  Accordingly,  we
recognize  expense for  performance  share awards  granted and do not  recognize
expense  for  fixed  employee  stock  options  granted.  The  after-tax  expense
recognized for performance share awards was  approximately  $1.5 million in 2005
($1.0 million in 2004; $3.0 million in 2003).  The following  table  illustrates
the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES. We review environmental matters on a quarterly basis.
Accruals  for  environmental  matters are  recorded  when it is probable  that a
liability  has been  incurred and the amount of the  liability can be reasonably
estimated,  based on current law and existing  technologies.  These accruals are
adjusted  periodically  as assessment  and  remediation  efforts  progress or as
additional  technical  or legal  information  becomes  available.  Accruals  for
environmental  liabilities  are  included in the balance  sheet at  undiscounted
amounts and exclude claims for recoveries from insurance or other third parties.
Costs related to environmental  contamination  treatment and cleanup are charged
to operating expense unless recoverable in rates from customers.

INCOME TAXES. We file a consolidated  federal income tax return.  We account for
income taxes using the liability  method as prescribed by SFAS 109,  "Accounting
for Income Taxes." Under the liability  method,  deferred  income tax assets and
liabilities are  established  for all temporary  differences in the book and tax
basis of  assets  and  liabilities,  based  upon  enacted  tax  laws  and  rates
applicable to the periods in which the taxes become payable.  Due to the effects
of regulation on Minnesota  Power,  certain  adjustments made to deferred income
taxes are, in turn, recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Investment tax
credits have been recorded as deferred credits and are being amortized to income
tax expense over the service lives of the related property.

NOTE 2.    OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

EXCISE TAXES.  We collect  excise taxes from our customers  levied by government
entities.  These taxes are stated  separately on the billing to the customer and
recorded as a liability to be remitted to the government  entity. We account for
the  collection  and  payment of these  taxes on the net basis and  neither  the
amounts collected or paid are reflected on our consolidated statement of income.

NEW ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS.  SFAS 123(R).  In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS
123(R), "Share-Based Payment," which will be effective for enterprises beginning
with the first  interim or annual  reporting  period of the  registrants'  first
fiscal year beginning on or after June 15, 2005.  SFAS 123(R) replaces SFAS 123,
"Accounting  for Stock-Based  Compensation,"  and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."  The new standard  requires that the
compensation  cost  relating to  share-based  payment be recognized in financial
statements at fair value.  As such,  reporting  employee stock options under the
intrinsic  value-based method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25 will no longer be
allowed.  Historically,  we have elected to use the  intrinsic  value method and
have not recognized  expense for employee stock options granted.  We implemented
SFAS 123(R) January 1, 2006,  using the modified  prospective  basis.  We do not
anticipate changing compensation plans for this accounting treatment.  We do not
believe it will have a material  impact on our  financial  position,  results of
operations or cash flows.

The FASB has  clarified  the  adoption  of SFAS  123(R)  with FSP SFAS  123(R)-1
"Classification and Measurement of Freestanding Financial Instruments Originally
Issued in Exchange for Employee  Services  under FASB  Statement No. 123(R)" and
FSP SFAS 123(R)-2  "Practical  Accommodation to the Application of Grant Date as
Defined in FASB  Statement  No.  123(R)."  These  staff  positions  clarify  the
implementation  of SFAS  123(R).  We do not  believe  they will have a  material
impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The  FASB has  proposed  FSP  SFAS  123(R)-c  "Transition  Election  Related  to
Accounting  for the Tax Effects of  Share-Based  Payment  Awards." This proposed
staff position  provides for an alternate method for the  implementation of SFAS
123(R). We do not believe it will have a material impact on the Company.

Interpretation  No. 47. In March 2005,  the FASB issued  Interpretation  No. 47,
"Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations." Interpretation No. 47
clarifies that the term  "conditional  asset  retirement  obligation" as used in
SFAS 143,  "Accounting  for  Asset  Retirement  Obligations,"  refers to a legal
obligation  to perform an asset  retirement  activity in which the timing and/or
method of settlement  are  conditional  on a future event that may or may not be
within the control of the entity.  However,  the obligation to perform the asset
retirement  activity is unconditional  even though  uncertainty exists about the
timing  and/or  method of  settlement.  Interpretation  No. 47 requires that the
uncertainty  about the timing and/or method of settlement of a conditional asset
retirement  obligation be factored into the  measurement  of the liability  when
sufficient  information  exists.  Interpretation  No. 47 also  clarifies when an
entity would have sufficient  information to reasonably  estimate the fair value
of an asset retirement obligation. Interpretation No. 47 is effective for fiscal
years ending after December 15, 2005. We have applied Interpretation No. 47 on a
prospective basis.

SFAS 153. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153,  "Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets--An   Amendment  of  APB  Opinion  No.  29,  Accounting  for  Nonmonetary
Transactions." SFAS 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for
nonmonetary  exchanges of similar  productive  assets in paragraph  21(b) of APB
Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, and replaces it with an
exception  for  exchanges  that  do not  have  commercial  substance.  SFAS  153
specifies  that a nonmonetary  exchange has  commercial  substance if the future
cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the
exchange.  SFAS 153 is effective  for fiscal  periods  beginning  after June 15,
2005,  and is  required  to be adopted  beginning  on  January  1, 2006.  We are
currently  evaluating  the effect that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have on our
consolidated  results of operations and financial condition but do not expect it
to have a material impact.

SFAS 154. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS 154,  "Accounting  Changes and Error
Corrections"  (SFAS 154) which replaces APB Opinion No. 20 "Accounting  Changes"
and SFAS 3, "Reporting  Accounting  Changes in Interim Financial  Statements--An
Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28." SFAS 154 provides  guidance on the  accounting
for and reporting of accounting  changes and error  corrections.  It establishes
retrospective  application,  or the latest  practicable  date,  as the  required
method for  reporting a change in  accounting  principle  and the reporting of a
correction  of an  error.  SFAS 154 is  effective  for  accounting  changes  and
corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We
are currently  evaluating  the effect that the adoption of SFAS 154 will have on
our consolidated results of operations and financial condition but do not expect
that adoption will have a material impact.

ASSET  RETIREMENT  OBLIGATIONS.  Pursuant  to SFAS  143,  "Accounting  for Asset
Retirement  Obligations," we recognize,  at fair value,  obligations  associated
with  the  retirement  of  tangible,  long-lived  assets  that  result  from the
acquisition,  construction or development  and/or normal operation of the asset.
The  associated  retirement  costs  are  capitalized  as  part  of  the  related
long-lived  asset and  depreciated  over the  useful  life of the  asset.  Asset
retirement  obligations  relate primarily to the  decommissioning of our utility
steam  generating  facilities  and  reclamation at BNI Coal, and are included in
Other  Liabilities on our consolidated  balance sheet.  Removal costs associated
with certain  distribution and  transmission  assets have not been recognized as
these facilities have been determined to have indeterminate  useful lives. Prior
to the adoption of SFAS 143,  utility  decommissioning  obligations were accrued
through  depreciation  expense  at  depreciation  rates  approved  by the  MPUC.
Conditional  asset retirement  obligations have been identified for treated wood
poles and remaining  polychlorinated  biphenyl and  asbestos-containing  assets,
however,  removal costs have not been recognized due to indeterminate settlement
dates.

NOTE 4.    REGULATORY MATTERS

ELECTRIC RATES.  Entities within our regulated utility segment file for periodic
rate  revisions  with the MPUC,  the FERC or the PSCW.  Minnesota  Power's  last
retail rate filing with the MPUC was in 1994.  SWL&P's  current retail rates are
based  on a 2005  PSCW  retail  rate  order.  In 2005,  72% of our  consolidated
operating revenue was under regulatory authority (75% in 2004; 73% in 2003). The
MPUC  had  regulatory  authority  over  approximately  56% of  our  consolidated
operating revenue in 2005 (60% in 2004; 57% in 2003).

DEFERRED  REGULATORY  CHARGES AND CREDITS.  Our regulated utility operations are
subject to the  provisions  of SFAS 71,  "Accounting  for the Effects of Certain
Types of  Regulation."  We capitalize as deferred  regulatory  charges  incurred
costs  which  are  probable  of  recovery  in  future  utility  rates.  Deferred
regulatory  credits  represent  amounts  expected to be credited to customers in
rates.  Deferred regulatory charges and credits are included in Other Assets and
Other Liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.

NOTE 5.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

SECURITIES  INVESTMENTS.  At December 31, 2005,  Investments included securities
accounted  for as  available-for-sale  under SFAS 115,  "Accounting  for Certain
Investments  in Debt and Equity  Securities,"  and  securities  in our  emerging
technology  portfolio.  Short-Term  Investments  included  various  auction rate
municipal  bonds and variable rate municipal  demand notes.  Income and realized
gains and losses from these  investments were included in Other Income (Expense)
on our consolidated income statement.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE  SECURITIES.  At December  31, 2005,  our  available-for-sale
securities  portfolio  consisted of securities in a grantor trust established to
fund certain employee  benefits included in Investments and various auction rate
municipal bonds and variable rate municipal  demand notes included as Short-Term
Investments.  Available-for-sale  securities  are  recorded  at fair  value with
unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other  comprehensive  income
(loss),  net of tax.  Unrealized  losses  that  are  other  than  temporary  are
recognized   in   earnings.    Our   short-term    investments   classified   as
available-for-sale securities, however, are recorded at cost, which approximates
fair market value due to their variable interest rates and typically reset every
7 to  35  days.  Despite  the  long-term  nature  of  their  stated  contractual
maturities,  we have the ability to quickly  liquidate  these  securities.  As a
result,  we had no cumulative gross  unrealized  holding gains (losses) or gross
realized gains (losses) from our short-term  investments.  All income  generated
from these short-term  investments was recorded as interest  income.  We use the
specific  identification  method  as the  basis  for  determining  the  cost  of
securities sold. Our policy is to review on a quarterly basis available-for-sale
securities for other than temporary  impairment by assessing such factors as the
share price trends and the impact of overall market  conditions.  As a result of
our periodic assessments, we did not record any impairment of available-for-sale
securities in 2005 or 2004.

During the fourth  quarter of 2004,  we sold 3.3  million  shares of ADESA stock
received  by our ESOP  plan  (see  Note 18) as a result  of the  September  2004
spin-off of ADESA. In total,  the ESOP received total proceeds of $65.9 million,
resulting  in a gain of $11.5  million,  which we  recognized  during the fourth
quarter of 2004. We accounted for the ADESA stock as available-for-sale.

During the second quarter of 2003, we sold the publicly-traded  investments held
in our emerging  technology  portfolio and  recognized a $2.3 million  after-tax
loss. These publicly-traded  emerging technology  investments were accounted for
as available-for-sale securities prior to sale.

EMERGING TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO.  As part of our emerging technology portfolio, we
have  several   minority   investments  in  venture  capital  funds  and  direct
investments in privately-held, start-up companies. We account for our investment
in venture  capital  funds under the equity method (see Note 15) and account for
our direct investment in privately-held  companies under the cost method because
of our ownership percentage. The total carrying value of our emerging technology
portfolio  was $9.2 million at December 31, 2005 ($13.6  million at December 31,
2004).  Our policy is to review these  investments  quarterly for  impairment by
assessing such factors as continued commercial viability of products,  cash flow
and earnings.  Any impairment would reduce the carrying value of the investment.
Our basis in direct  investments  in  privately-held  companies  included in the
emerging  technology  portfolio  was zero at December 31, 2005 ($4.5  million at
December 31,  2004).  In 2005, we recorded $5.1 million ($3.3 million after tax)
of impairments  that related to direct  investments  in certain  privately-held,
start-up companies whose future business prospects had significantly diminished.
Developments at these companies  indicated that future commercial  viability was
unlikely,  as was new financing necessary to continue  development.  In 2004, we
recorded $6.5 million ($4.1 million after tax) of impairments. We did not record
any impairments in 2003.

FAIR VALUE OF  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS.  With the  exception  of the items listed

carrying amount.  The fair value for the items below were based on quoted market

Minnesota Power sells electricity to 12 Large Power Customers.  Receivables from
these  customers  totaled  approximately  $10 million at  December  31, 2005 ($9
million at December 31,  2004).  Minnesota  Power does not obtain  collateral to
support  utility  receivables,   but  monitors  the  credit  standing  of  major
customers.  In addition, our  taconite-producing  Large Power Customers are on a
weekly  billing cycle,  which allows us to closely manage  collection of amounts
due.

NOTE 7.    SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT

SHORT-TERM  DEBT.  Total  short-term debt  outstanding at December 31, 2005, was
$2.7 million ($1.8 million at December 31, 2004) and consisted of Long-Term Debt
Due Within One Year.

As of December 31, 2005, we had bank lines of credit  aggregating $120.0 million
($111.5  million at December 31, 2004),  the majority of which were to expire in
December  2007.  These bank lines of credit  made  financing  available  through
short-term  bank loans and provided  credit  support for  commercial  paper.  At
December 31, 2005, $1.1 million ($0 at December 31, 2004) was drawn on our lines
of credit leaving a $118.9 million balance  available for use ($111.5 million at
December 31,  2004).  The $1.1 million  drawn amount  relates to an $8.5 million
revolving  development  loan with  CypressCoquina  Bank that we entered  into in
March 2005.  The  revolving  development  loan has an interest rate equal to the
prime  rate,  with an  initial  term of 36  months.  The term of the loan may be
extended 24 months if certain  conditions  are met.  The loan is  guaranteed  by
Lehigh  Acquisition  Corporation.  Certain lines of credit required a commitment
fee of 0.15%.  There was no commercial  paper issued as of December 31, 2005, or
December 31, 2004.

In January  2006, we renewed,  increased  and extended a committed,  syndicated,
unsecured   revolving   credit   facility  (Line)  with  LaSalle  Bank  National
Association  for $150  million  ($100  million at December 31,  2004).  The Line
matures on January 11, 2011,  and requires a  commitment  fee of 0.125%.  At our
request and subject to certain  conditions,  the Line may be  increased  to $200
million and extended for two additional  12-month periods.  The Line may be used
for general  corporate  purposes,  working  capital and to provide  liquidity in
support of our commercial paper program. We may prepay amounts outstanding under
the Line in whole or in part at our discretion. Additionally, we may irrevocably
terminate or reduce the size of the Line prior to maturity.

NOTE 7.    SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT (CONTINUED)

LONG-TERM  DEBT. The aggregate  amount of long-term debt maturing during 2006 is
$2.7 million  ($84.1  million in 2007;  $57.4 million in 2008;  $10.6 million in
2009; $4.9 million in 2010; and $230.8 million thereafter). Substantially all of
our  electric  plant is subject to the lien of the  mortgages  securing  various
first mortgage bonds.

In August  2005,  we issued $35 million in  principal  amount of First  Mortgage
Bonds,  5.28% due 2020.  Proceeds  were used to redeem $35 million in  principal
amount of First Mortgage Bonds, 7 1/2% Series originally due 2007.

In October 2005, we accepted an offer from certain  institutional  buyers in the
private  placement  market to purchase  $50 million in  principal  amount of our
first  mortgage  bonds.  When issued,  on or about March 1, 2006, the bonds will
carry an interest rate of 5.69% and will have a term of 30 years. On January 30,
2006, we called for redemption on March 2, 2006, $50 million in principal amount
of First Mortgage Bonds, 7% Series due 2008.

according to the terms of the obligations.

FINANCIAL  COVENANTS.  Our  lines of credit  and  letters  of credit  supporting
certain  long-term  debt  arrangements  contain  financial  covenants.  The most
restrictive covenant requires ALLETE to maintain a quarterly ratio of its funded
debt to total capital of less than or equal to .65 to 1.00. Failure to meet this
covenant could give rise to an event of default,  if not corrected  after notice
from the lender, in which event ALLETE may need to pursue alternative sources of
funding. Some of ALLETE's debt arrangements contain  "cross-default"  provisions
that  would  result in an event of  default  if there is a failure  under  other
financing  arrangements to meet payment terms or to observe other covenants that
would result in an acceleration of payments due.

NOTE 8.    COMMON STOCK AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

Our Articles of  Incorporation  and mortgages  contain  provisions  that,  under
certain circumstances,  would restrict the payment of common stock dividends. As
of December 31, 2005, no retained  earnings were restricted as a result of these
provisions.

REVERSE  COMMON STOCK SPLIT.  On September 20, 2004, our  one-for-three  reverse
common stock split became effective. All common share and per share amounts have
been adjusted for all periods to reflect the one-for-three reverse stock split.

</TABLE>

SHAREHOLDER  RIGHTS PLAN.  In 1996, we adopted a rights plan that provides for a
dividend  distribution  of one  preferred  share  purchase  right  (Right) to be
attached to each share of common stock.

The Rights,  which are currently not exercisable or transferable  apart from our
common stock,  entitle the holder to purchase  one-and-a-half  of  one-hundredth
(three  two-hundredths)  of a share of ALLETE's Junior Serial Preferred Stock A,
without par value. The purchase price as defined in the Rights Plan,  remains at
$90.  These  Rights  would  become  exercisable  if a person  or group  acquires
beneficial  ownership  of 15% or more of our common  stock or announces a tender
offer which would increase the person's or group's beneficial ownership interest
to 15% or more of our common stock,  subject to certain  exceptions.  If the 15%
threshold  is met,  each Right  entitles  the holder  (other than the  acquiring
person or group) to purchase common stock (or, in certain  circumstances,  cash,
property or other  securities  of ours) having a market price equal to twice the
exercise  price  of the  Right.  If we are  acquired  in a  merger  or  business
combination,  or 50% or more of our  assets or  earning  power  are  sold,  each
exercisable  Right entitles the holder to purchase common stock of the acquiring
or surviving  company  having a value equal to twice the  exercise  price of the
Right.  Certain stock acquisitions will also trigger a provision  permitting the
Board of Directors to exchange each Right for one share of our common stock.

The Rights,  which expire on July 23, 2006, are nonvoting and may be redeemed by
us at a price of  $0.005  per Right at any time  they are not  exercisable.  One
million shares of Junior Serial  Preferred  Stock A have been authorized and are
reserved for issuance under the plan.

EARNINGS PER SHARE. The difference  between basic and diluted earnings per share
arises from outstanding stock options and performance share awards granted under
our Executive and Director Long-Term Incentive  Compensation Plans. For 2005, no
options to purchase shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of
diluted  earnings per share  because they were  anti-dilutive  due to the option
exercise prices being greater than the average market price of the common shares
during the period (0.1  million  shares were  excluded  for 2004;  0 shares were
excluded for 2003).

NOTE 9.    JOINTLY-OWNED ELECTRIC FACILITY

We own 80% of the 536-MW Boswell Energy Center Unit 4 (Boswell Unit 4). While we
operate the plant,  certain decisions about the operations of Boswell Unit 4 are
subject to the oversight of a committee on which we and Wisconsin  Public Power,
Inc.,  the owner of the other 20% of Boswell  Unit 4, have equal  representation
and voting rights. Each of us must provide our own financing and is obligated to
pay our  ownership  share of  operating  costs.  Our share of  direct  operating
expenses of Boswell Unit 4 is included in operating  expense on our consolidated
statement of income. Our 80% share of the original cost of Boswell Unit 4, which
is included in property,  plant and  equipment  at December  31, 2005,  was $310
million  ($309  million at December 31,  2004).  The  corresponding  accumulated
depreciation  balance  was $162  million at December  31, 2005 ($157  million at
December 31, 2004).


NOTE 10.   COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS. SQUARE BUTTE POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT. Minnesota
Power has a power purchase agreement with Square Butte that extends through 2026
(Agreement).  It provides a long-term  supply of low-cost energy to customers in
our electric  service  territory and enables  Minnesota Power to meet power pool
reserve requirements. Square Butte, a North Dakota cooperative corporation, owns
a 455-MW coal-fired  generating unit (Unit) near Center,  North Dakota. The Unit
is  adjacent  to a  generating  unit owned by  Minnkota  Power,  a North  Dakota
cooperative  corporation whose Class A members are also members of Square Butte.
Minnkota Power serves as the operator of the Unit and also purchases  power from
Square Butte.

Minnesota Power was entitled to approximately 71% of the Unit's output under the
Agreement.  After  2005,  and upon  compliance  with a two-year  advance  notice
requirement,   Minnkota  Power  has  the  option  to  reduce  Minnesota  Power's
entitlement by approximately 5% annually, to a minimum of 50%. In December 2005,
2004 and 2003, we received notices from Minnkota Power that they will reduce our
output  entitlement by  approximately  5% on January 1, 2006, 2007, and 2008, to
66%, 60% and 55% respectively.

Minnesota  Power is obligated to pay its pro rata share of Square  Butte's costs
based on Minnesota Power's entitlement to Unit output. Minnesota Power's payment
obligation will be suspended if Square Butte fails to deliver any power, whether
produced or  purchased,  for a period of one year.  Square  Butte's  fixed costs
consist primarily of debt service.  At December 31, 2005, Square Butte had total
debt  outstanding of $310.7 million.  Total annual debt service for Square Butte
is expected to be  approximately  $26 million in each of the years 2006  through
2010.  Variable  operating  costs include the price of coal  purchased  from BNI
Coal, our subsidiary, under a long-term contract.

Minnesota  Power's  cost of power  purchased  from Square  Butte during 2005 was
$56.4 million ($56.1  million in 2004 and $52.3 million in 2003).  This reflects
Minnesota  Power's pro rata share of total Square Butte costs,  based on the 71%
output entitlement in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Included in this amount was Minnesota
Power's  pro rata  share of  interest  expense of $13.6  million in 2005  ($12.6
million in 2004;  $12.8 million in 2003).  Minnesota  Power's payments to Square
Butte are approved as a purchased power expense for ratemaking  purposes by both
the MPUC and the FERC.

LEASING AGREEMENTS.  In September 2004, BNI Coal entered into an operating lease
agreement  for a new  dragline  that was placed in service at BNI Coal's mine on
September 30, 2004. BNI Coal is obligated to make lease  payments  totaling $2.8
million  annually  for the lease  term which  expires in 2027.  BNI Coal has the
option at the end of the lease term to renew the lease at a fair market  rental,
to purchase the dragline at fair market value,  or to surrender the dragline and
pay a $3.0 million  termination  fee. We lease other  properties  and  equipment
under operating lease agreements with terms expiring through 2013. The aggregate
amount of minimum  lease  payments for all  operating  leases is $6.4 million in
2006,  $5.9 million in 2007,  $5.2 million in 2008,  $4.7 million in 2009,  $4.2
million  in 2010 and $46.9  million  thereafter.  Total  rent  expense  was $6.2
million in 2005 ($3.8 million in 2004; $3.2 million in 2003).

COAL,  RAIL AND SHIPPING  CONTRACTS.  We have three coal supply  agreements with
various  expiration  dates ranging from December 2006 to December  2009. We also
have rail and shipping  agreements for  transportation  of all of our coal, with
various  expiration  dates  ranging from  December  2006 to December  2011.  Our
minimum  annual  payment   obligations  under  these  coal,  rail  and  shipping
agreements  are  currently  $40.5 million in 2006,  $9.7 million in 2007,  $10.1
million in 2008, $6.1 million in 2009 and no specific  commitments  beyond 2009.
Our minimum annual payment obligations will increase when annual nominations are
made for coal deliveries in future years.

FUEL CLAUSE RECOVERY OF MISO DAY 2 COSTS.  Minnesota Power filed a petition with
the MPUC in  February  2005 to amend its fuel  clause to  accommodate  costs and
revenue  related  to MISO Day 2. On April 7,  2005,  the MPUC  approved  interim
accounting  treatment of MISO Day 2 costs to be accounted for on a net basis and
recovered through the fuel clause, subject to refund with interest. This interim
treatment has continued while the MPUC has addressed the cost recovery petitions
from Xcel Energy Inc., Otter Tail Power Company,  Alliant Energy Corporation and
Minnesota Power.

On December 21, 2005, the MPUC issued an order which denied recovery through the
fuel  clause  of  uplift   charges,   congestion   revenue  and  expenses,   and
administrative  costs related to Minnesota Power's MISO Day 2 market activities.
Minnesota Power requested  rehearing of the order in a filing made with the MPUC
on January 10, 2006. The other three utilities  affected by the order also filed
for  rehearing,  as did the DOC and MISO. In a hearing on February 9, 2006,  the
MPUC  granted  rehearing  of the MISO  Day 2 docket  and  suspended  the  refund
obligation.  The MPUC will review the MISO Day 2 costs to determine  which costs
should be recovered on a current  basis  through the fuel clause and which costs
are more  appropriately  deferred for potential recovery through base rates. The
Company is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.

EMERGING  TECHNOLOGY  PORTFOLIO.  We have  investments in emerging  technologies
through  minority  investments  in venture  capital funds  structured as limited
liability  companies,   and  direct  investments  in  privately-held,   start-up
companies.  The  carrying  value of our direct  investments  in  privately-held,
start-up  companies  was zero at December 31, 2005 ($4.5 million at December 31,
2004).  We have committed to make  additional  investments  in certain  emerging
technology  venture capital funds. The total future  commitment was $3.1 million
at December 31, 2005 ($4.5 million at December 31, 2004),  and is expected to be
invested  at  various  times  through  2007.  We do not  have  plans to make any
additional investments beyond this commitment.

INVESTMENT IN ATC. On December 16, 2005,  ALLETE  entered into an agreement with
Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and WPS Investments,  LLC that provides for
ALLETE,  through its  Wisconsin  subsidiary,  Rainy River Energy  Corporation  -
Wisconsin,  to invest $60 million in ATC by the end of 2006. ALLETE's investment
will  represent an estimated 9%  ownership  interest in ATC. The  investment  by
ALLETE's subsidiary in ATC is subject to review by the PSCW.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Our businesses are subject to regulation of environmental
matters by various federal, state and local authorities.  Due to future stricter
environmental  requirements through legislation and/or rulemaking, we anticipate
that potential  expenditures for environmental matters will be material and will
require  significant capital  investments.  We are unable to predict if and when
any such stricter environmental requirements will be imposed and the impact they
will have on the Company. We review environmental  matters on a quarterly basis.
Accruals  for  environmental  matters are  recorded  when it is probable  that a
liability  has been  incurred and the amount of the  liability can be reasonably
estimated,  based on current law and existing  technologies.  These accruals are
adjusted  periodically  as assessment  and  remediation  efforts  progress or as
additional  technical  or legal  information  becomes  available.  Accruals  for
environmental  liabilities  are  included in the balance  sheet at  undiscounted
amounts and exclude claims for recoveries from insurance or other third parties.
Costs related to environmental  contamination  treatment and cleanup are charged
to expense unless recoverable in rates from customers.

SWL&P  MANUFACTURED  GAS PLANT. In May 2001, SWL&P received notice from the WDNR
that the City of Superior had found soil  contamination on property  adjoining a
former  Manufactured  Gas Plant (MGP) site owned and operated by SWL&P from 1889
to 1904. The WDNR requested  SWL&P to initiate an  environmental  investigation.
The WDNR also issued  SWL&P a  Responsible  Party  letter in February  2002.  In
February  2003,  SWL&P  submitted a Phase II  environmental  site  investigation
report to the WDNR.  This report  identified  some MGP-like  chemicals that were
found in the soil near the  former  plant  site.  During  March and April  2003,
sediment  samples were taken from nearby Superior Bay. The report on the results
of this  sampling was completed and sent to the WDNR during the first quarter of
2004. The next phase of the investigation was to determine any impact to soil or
ground water  between the former MGP site and Superior  Bay.  Site work for this
phase of the  investigation  was performed  during  October 2004,  and the final
report was sent to the WDNR in March 2005.  Additional  site  investigation  was
performed  during  September and October 2005. It is anticipated that additional
site work will be performed in 2006. Although it is not possible to quantify the
potential  clean-up cost until the  investigation  is completed,  a $0.5 million
liability  was  recorded  in  December  2003  to  address  the  known  areas  of
contamination.  The  Company has  recorded a  corresponding  dollar  amount as a
regulatory  asset to  offset  this  liability.  The PSCW  has  approved  SWL&P's
deferral of these MGP environmental  investigation and potential  clean-up costs
for future recovery in rates,  subject to a regulatory  prudency review.  In May
2005,  the PSCW  approved  the  collection  through  rates of  $150,000  of site
investigation  costs that had been  incurred  at the time SWL&P filed their most
recent rate request.  ALLETE maintains  pollution  liability  insurance coverage
that  includes  coverage for SWL&P.  A claim has been filed with respect to this
matter.  The insurance carrier has issued a reservation of rights letter and the
Company  continues to work with the insurer to  determine  the  availability  of
insurance coverage.

SQUARE BUTTE GENERATING FACILITY.  In June 2002, Minnkota Power, the operator of
Square Butte,  received a Notice of Violation from the EPA regarding alleged New
Source Review  violations at the M.R. Young  Station,  which includes the Square
Butte  generating  unit. The EPA claims certain  capital  projects  completed by
Minnkota  Power  should have been  reviewed  pursuant  to the New Source  Review
regulations,  potentially  resulting in new air permit operating  conditions and
possible  significant  capital  expenditures to comply.  Minnkota Power has held
several  meetings  with the EPA to discuss the alleged  violations.  Discussions
between  Minnkota Power and the EPA are ongoing and we are unable to predict the
outcome or cost impacts. If Square Butte is required to make significant capital
expenditures  to  comply  with the EPA  requirements,  we  expect  such  capital
expenditures  to be debt  financed.  Our future  cost of  purchased  power would
include our pro rata share of this additional debt service.

CLEAN  WATER ACT - FISH  IMPINGEMENT/ENTRAINMENT  REDUCTION  STANDARDS.  In July
2004,  the EPA issued  Section  316(b)  Phase II Rule of the Clean  Water Act to
ensure that the  location,  design,  construction  and capacity of cooling water
intake structures at electric generating  facilities reflect the best technology
available to reduce fish  mortality due to  impingement  (being  pinned  against
screens or other  parts of a cooling  water  intake  structure)  or  entrainment
(being drawn into cooling water  systems and  subjected to thermal,  physical or
chemical  stresses).  The new rule for fish impingement  mortality  requirements
apply to the Boswell,  Laskin,  Hibbard and Square Butte generating  facilities.
The impingement and entrainment requirements apply to Taconite Harbor because it
is  located  on  Lake  Superior.   The  rule  requires  biological  studies  and
engineering  analyses to be  performed  within the 2005 to 2008  timeframe.  The
biological  studies were  initiated in 2005.  The estimated  total cost of these
studies for our  facilities  is  expected to be in the range of $0.5  million to
$1.0  million.  At this time,  we cannot  estimate  the capital  and/or  aquatic
restoration expenditures that may be required to comply with the Section 316 (b)
Phase II Rule.

EPA CLEAN AIR INTERSTATE RULE AND CLEAN AIR MERCURY RULE. In March 2005, the EPA
announced  the  final  Clean  Air  Interstate   Rule  (CAIR)  that  reduces  and
permanently  caps emissions of SO2 and NOX in many of the eastern United States.
The CAIR  includes  Minnesota  as one of the 28 states it considers an "eastern"
state.  The EPA also  announced  the final  Clean Air  Mercury  Rule (CAMR) that
reduces  and  permanently  caps  electric  utility  mercury   emissions  in  the
continental  United  States.  The  CAIR  and  the  CAMR  regulations  have  been
challenged  in the  court  system,  which  may  delay  implementation  or modify
provisions.  Minnesota Power is  participating in a legal challenge to the CAIR,
but is not participating in the challenge of the CAMR.  However, if the CAMR and
the CAIR do go into effect,  Minnesota  Power expects to be required to (1) make
emissions  reductions,  (2) purchase mercury, SO2 and NOX allowances through the
EPA's cap-and-trade system, or (3) use a combination of both.

We believe that the CAIR  contains  flaws in its  methodology  and  application,
which will cause Minnesota Power to incur significantly higher compliance costs.
Consequently, on July 11, 2005, Minnesota Power filed a Petition for Review with
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Company also
filed a Petition for Reconsideration  with the EPA. If the litigation and/or the
Petition for Reconsideration are successful, we expect to incur lower compliance
costs,  consistent  with the rules  applicable  to those  states  considered  as
"western"  states  under the CAIR.  On  November  22,  2005,  the EPA  agreed to
reconsider  certain aspects of its CAIR,  including the Minnesota Power petition
addressing modeling used to determine  Minnesota's  inclusion in the CAIR region
and  claims  about  inequities  in  the  SO2  allowance  methodology.   The  EPA
anticipates making a decision regarding the petitions in mid-March 2006.

COMMUNITY  DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT  OBLIGATIONS.  In March 2005, the Town Center at
Palm Coast Community  Development  District (Town Center  District) issued $26.4
million of tax-exempt,  6% Capital  Improvement  Revenue Bonds, Series 2005, due
May 1,  2036.  The  bonds  were  issued  to fund a  portion  of the Town  Center
development project. Approximately $21 million of the bond proceeds will be used
for  construction  of  infrastructure  improvements  at Town  Center,  with  the
remaining funds to be used for capitalized interest, a debt service reserve fund
and costs of  issuance.  The bonds are  payable  from and secured by the revenue
derived  from  assessments  imposed,  levied and  collected  by the Town  Center
District.   The  assessments  represent  an  allocation  of  the  costs  of  the
improvements,  including  bond  financing  costs,  to the lands  within the Town
Center  District  benefiting  from the  improvements.  The  assessments  will be
included in the annual  property tax bills of  landowners  beginning in November
2006.  To the extent  that we still own land at the time of the  assessment,  in
accordance  with EITF  91-10,  we will  recognize  an  expense  for our pro rata
portion of  assessments,  based upon our  ownership  of benefited  property.  At
December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 92% of the assessable land in the Town
Center District.

GUARANTEE.   ALLETE  guarantees  $1.0  million  of  Northwest  Airlines,  Inc.'s
(Northwest  Airlines)  payments of principal  and  interest on $24.7  million of
"Duluth  Airport  Lease  Revenue  Bonds" (to be paid out of lease  revenue  from
Northwest  Airlines  to the Duluth  Economic  Development  Authority).  In 2005,
following  Northwest  Airlines'  bankruptcy  filing  and its  default  on  other
obligations,  we  recorded a $1.0  million  ($0.6  million  after tax) charge to
recognize the probable  payments on this guarantee.  In January 2006,  Northwest
Airlines was delinquent in their rent payments and the bond trustee drew $62,000
on ALLETE's letter of credit that collateralized  ALLETE's guarantee to make the
payment.

OTHER.  We are involved in litigation  arising in the normal course of business.
Also in the normal course of business,  we are involved in tax,  regulatory  and
other  governmental  audits,  inspections,  investigations and other proceedings
that involve state and federal taxes, safety, compliance with regulations,  rate
base and cost of service  issues,  among other things.  While the  resolution of
such matters could have a material effect on earnings and cash flows in the year
of  resolution,  none of these  matters are  expected to  materially  change our
present liquidity position,  nor have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition.


NOTE 11.    KENDALL COUNTY CHARGE

On April 1, 2005,  Rainy River  Energy,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of ALLETE,
completed  the  assignment  of its power  purchase  agreement  with  LSP-Kendall
Energy,  LLC,  the owner of an energy  generation  facility  located  in Kendall
County,  Illinois, to Constellation Energy Commodities.  Rainy River Energy paid
Constellation  Energy  Commodities  $73  million  in cash to  assume  the  power
purchase  agreement  that  remains in effect  through  mid-September  2017.  The
payment  resulted in a charge to our operating  income in the second  quarter of
2005.  The tax benefits of the payment  will be realized  through a capital loss
carryback  for federal  income tax  purposes  and have been  recorded as current
deferred  income tax assets.  The tax  benefits  are  expected to be realized in
2006.  In addition,  consent,  advisory  and closing  costs of $4.9 million were
incurred to complete the transaction.  As a result of this  transaction,  ALLETE
incurred a charge to operating  expenses  totaling  $77.9 million ($50.4 million
after tax, or $1.84 per diluted share) in the second quarter of 2005.

interest was a 2.5% benefit for 2005; (28.8% expense for 2004; 35.8% expense for
2003). The 2005 effective rate was impacted by three major items. Deferred taxes
were adjusted by $2.5 million to reflect comprehensive tax planning initiatives.
Current taxes were adjusted by $3.7 million to reflect the receipt of a positive
audit report. The 2005 effective rate also reflected an increase in taxes due to
the inability to recognize any state benefit for capital loss carryforwards.

NOTE 14.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

ENVENTIS  TELECOM.  On  December  30,  2005,  we  sold  all  the  stock  of  our
telecommunications  subsidiary,  Enventis  Telecom,  to  HickoryTech of Mankato,
Minnesota,  for $35.5 million.  The transaction resulted in an after-tax loss of
$3.6 million, which was included in our 2005 loss from discontinued  operations.
Net cash proceeds  realized from the sale were  approximately  $29 million after
transaction costs,  repayment of debt and payment of income taxes. In accordance
with SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,"
we have reported our telecommunications  business in discontinued operations for
all periods presented.  Our telecommunications  business was previously included
in our business segment identified as Other.

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES.  On September 20, 2004, the spin-off of Automotive Services
was completed by distributing to ALLETE  shareholders  all of ALLETE's shares of
ADESA common  stock.  One share of ADESA common stock was  distributed  for each
outstanding  share of  ALLETE  common  stock  held at the close of  business  on
September 13, 2004,  the record date.  The  distribution  was made from ALLETE's
retained  earnings  to the  extent of  ADESA's  undistributed  earnings  ($363.4
million), with the remainder made from common stock ($600.2 million).

In June 2004,  ADESA issued 6.3 million  shares of common  stock  through an IPO
priced at $24.00  per share,  which  netted  proceeds  of $136.0  million  after
transaction costs, issued $125 million of senior notes and borrowed $275 million
under a new $525  million  credit  facility.  With  these  funds,  ADESA  repaid
previously  existing debt and all intercompany  debt outstanding to ALLETE.  The
IPO  represented  6.6% of ADESA's 94.9  million  shares then  outstanding.  As a
result of the IPO, ALLETE recorded a $70.1 million increase to Common Stock with
no  gain  recognized  pursuant  to  SEC  Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  Topic  5H,
"Accounting  for  Sales of Stock by a  Subsidiary."  We  accounted  for the 6.6%
public  ownership  of ADESA as a  minority  interest  and  continued  to own and
consolidate  the remaining  portion of ADESA until the spin-off was completed on
September 20, 2004.

In  accordance  with SFAS 144,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  or Disposal of
Long-Lived  Assets,"  we have  reported  our  Automotive  Services  business  in
Discontinued Operations.

WATER SERVICES.  During 2003, we sold, under  condemnation or imminent threat of
condemnation, substantially all of our water assets in Florida for a total sales
price of approximately  $445 million.  Income from  discontinued  operations for
2003 included a $71.6 million  after-tax gain on the sale of  substantially  all
our Water Services businesses. The gain was net of all selling,  transaction and
employee  termination benefit expenses,  as well as impairment losses on certain
remaining assets.

In June 2004, we  essentially  concluded our strategy to exit our Water Services
businesses when we completed the sale of our North Carolina water assets and the
sale of the remaining 72 water and wastewater systems in Florida. Aqua Utilities
purchased  our  North   Carolina  water  assets  for  $48  million  and  assumed
approximately $28 million in debt. Aqua Utilities also purchased 63 of our water
and wastewater systems in Florida for $14 million. Seminole County purchased the
remaining 9 Florida  systems for a total of $4 million.  The FPSC  approved  the
Seminole  County  transaction in September  2004. On December 20, 2005, the FPSC
ordered a $1.7 million reduction to plant investment, which the Company reserved
for in 2005,  and approved the transfer of the remaining 63 water and wastewater
systems from Florida Water to Aqua Utilities. Aqua Utilities filed a protest and
requested that the FPSC schedule  evidentiary  hearings.  The FPSC's decision on
these issues may change the  reduction to plant  investment  ordered in 2005 and
could  result  in an  adjustment  to the  final  purchase  price  paid  by  Aqua
Utilities.  Gains in 2004 from the sale of our  North  Carolina  assets  and the
remaining  systems in Florida were offset by an adjustment to gains  reported in
2003,  resulting in an overall net loss of $0.5 million in 2004.  The adjustment
to gains  reported  in 2003  resulted  primarily  from an  arbitration  award in
December  2004  relating to a  gain-sharing  provision on a system sold in 2003;
$5.1 million was recorded in 2004 ($1.2 million in 2003).

In February 2005, we completed the exit from our Water Services  businesses with
the sale of our wastewater assets in Georgia for an immaterial gain. In 2005, we
also  incurred  administrative  and other  expenses  to  support  Florida  Water
transfer  proceedings and recorded the $1.7 million rate-base  settlement charge
related to the sale of 63 of Florida Water systems to Aqua  Utilities  mentioned
above.

The net cash proceeds from the sale of all water assets in 2003 and 2004,  after
transaction  costs,  retirement of most Florida Water debt and payment of income
taxes, were approximately  $300 million.  These net proceeds were used to retire
debt at ALLETE.

In  accordance  with SFAS 144,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  or Disposal of
Long-Lived  Assets," we suspended  depreciating  our Water Services  assets when
they  were   classified  as   held-for-sale   in  2001.  Had  we  not  suspended
depreciation,  depreciation  expense at our Water Services businesses would have
been $2.6 million in 2004 and $12.9 million in 2003.

NOTE 15.   CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

In the third quarter of 2004, we adopted EITF 03-16, "Accounting for Investments
in Limited Liability  Companies," which requires the use of the equity method of
accounting  for  investments  in  all  limited  liability  companies,  including
investments  we have in venture  capital  funds within our  emerging  technology
portfolio.  EITF  03-16  was  issued  in the  second  quarter  of  2004.  We had
previously  accounted for these investments under the cost method of accounting.
EITF 03-16 is effective for  reporting  periods  beginning  after June 15, 2004.
Pursuant  to EITF 03-16,  the effect of  adoption is reported as the  cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of this change
on prior years was a loss of $13.3 million ($7.8 million  after-tax),  which was
recorded as a change in  accounting  principle  and  reflected in income for the
year ended December 31, 2004.  During 2004, $1.6 million of current losses under
the equity method were recognized ($0 in 2005).

NOTE 17.   PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

We  have  noncontributory   defined  benefit  pension  plans  covering  eligible
employees.  The plans  provide  defined  benefits  based on years of service and
final  average pay. We also have defined  contribution  pension  plans  covering
substantially  all  employees;  employer  contributions  are  made  through  our
employee  stock  ownership plan (see Note 18),  except for BNI Coal,  which made
cash  contributions  of $0.7 million in 2005 ($0.6  million in each of the years
2004 and 2003).

We have  postretirement  health care and life insurance plans covering  eligible
employees.  The  postretirement  health plans are contributory  with participant
contributions  adjusted  annually.  Postretirement  health and life benefits are
funded through a combination of Voluntary  Employee Benefit  Association  trusts
(VEBAs),  established  under section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code, and
an irrevocable grantor trust.  Contributions  deductible for income tax purposes
are made  directly  to the VEBAs;  nondeductible  contributions  are made to the
irrevocable grantor trust.  Amounts are transferred from the irrevocable grantor
trust to the VEBAs when they  become  deductible  for income  tax  purposes.  In
December 2005,  after the measurement  date,  $11.4 million was transferred from
the grantor trust to the VEBAs.

We use a September 30 measurement date for the pension and postretirement health
and life plans.

Under SFAS 106,  "Employers'  Accounting for Postretirement  Benefits Other Than
Pensions,"  only  assets in the VEBAs are  treated  as plan  assets in the table
above  for  the  purpose  of  determining  funded  status.  In  addition  to the
postretirement health and life assets reported above, we had $22.6 million in an
irrevocable  grantor  trust at December 31, 2005 ($28.8  million at December 31,
2004).  We  consolidate  the  irrevocable  grantor  trust and it is  included in
Investments on our consolidated balance sheet.

In establishing the expected  long-term  return on plan assets,  we consider the
diversification  and allocation of plan assets, the actual long-term  historical
performance  for the  type of  securities  invested  in,  the  actual  long-term
historical  performance  of plan  assets  and the  impact  of  current  economic
conditions, if any, on long-term historical returns.

Currently  for  plan  valuation  purposes,   the  discount  rate  is  determined
considering  high-quality  long-term corporate bond rates at the valuation date.
The discount rate is compared to various bond indices for reasonableness.

To achieve strong returns within managed risk, we diversify our asset  portfolio
to approximate the target allocations in the table below.  Equity securities are
diversified   among  domestic   companies  with  large,  mid  and  small  market
capitalizations, as well as investments in international companies. In addition,
all debt securities must have a Standard & Poor's credit rating of A or higher.

We expect to contribute  approximately $8 million to our  postretirement  health
and life plans and  approximately  $10  million to our defined  benefit  pension
plans in 2006.

In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP 106-2,  "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003 (Act)," which provides  accounting  and  disclosure  guidance for employers
that sponsor  postretirement  health care plans that provide  prescription  drug
benefits.  FSP  106-2  requires  that  the  accumulated  postretirement  benefit
obligation  and  postretirement  benefit cost reflect the impact of the Act upon
adoption.  We provide  postretirement  health benefits that include prescription
drug  benefits and have  concluded  that our  prescription  drug  benefits  will
qualify us for the federal  subsidy to be provided for under the Act. We adopted
FSP 106-2 in the third  quarter of 2004.  The  impact of  adoption  reduced  our
after-tax  postretirement medical expense by $3.5 million for 2005 ($1.6 million
for 2004).

In 2005,  we  determined  that our  postretirement  health  care  plans meet the
requirements   of  the  Centers  for  Medicare  and  Medicaid   Services'  (CMS)
regulations,  and enrolled  with the CMS to begin  recovering  the  subsidy.  We
expect to receive the first subsidy check in early 2007 for 2006 credits.


NOTE 18.   EMPLOYEE STOCK AND INCENTIVE PLANS

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP  PLAN. We sponsor a leveraged  employee stock ownership
plan (ESOP) within the Retirement  Savings and Stock  Ownership Plan (RSOP) that
covers certain  eligible  employees.  In 1989, the ESOP used the proceeds from a
$16.5 million third-party loan, guaranteed by us, to purchase 0.6 million shares
(0.4 million  shares  adjusted for stock splits) of our common stock on the open
market. This loan was fully repaid in 2004, and all shares originally  purchased
with loan proceeds have been allocated to participants. In 1990, the ESOP issued
a  $75  million  note  (term  not  to  exceed  25  years  at  10.25%)  to  us as
consideration  for 2.8 million  shares (1.9  million  shares  adjusted for stock
splits) of our newly issued common stock. The Company makes annual contributions
to the ESOP equal to the ESOP's debt service less available  dividends  received
by the ESOP. The majority of dividends received by the ESOP are used to pay debt
service,  with the balance  distributed  to  participants.  The ESOP shares were
initially pledged as collateral for its debt. As the debt is repaid,  shares are
released from collateral and allocated to  participants  based on the proportion
of debt service paid in the year.  As shares are released from  collateral,  the
Company  reports  compensation  expense equal to the current market price of the
shares less  dividends on allocated  shares.  Dividends on allocated ESOP shares
are  recorded  as a reduction  of  retained  earnings;  available  dividends  on
unallocated  ESOP  shares  are  recorded  as a  reduction  of debt  and  accrued
interest.  ESOP  compensation  expense was $5.5 million in 2005 ($5.0 million in
2004; $3.7 million in 2003).

As a result of the  September  2004  spin-off of ADESA,  the ESOP  received  3.3
million  shares of ADESA common stock  related to unearned  ESOP shares that had
not been  allocated  to  participants.  The ESOP was  required to sell the ADESA
common  stock and use the proceeds to purchase  ALLETE  common stock on the open
market.  At December 31, 2004, the ESOP had sold all of these ADESA shares.  The
3.3 million ADESA shares sold by the ESOP in 2004 resulted in total  proceeds of
$65.9 million and an after-tax gain of $11.5 million, which we recognized in the
fourth quarter of 2004. (See Note 12.)

Under the direction of an independent trustee, the ESOP began using the proceeds
to purchase  shares of ALLETE  common stock in October  2004. As of February 15,
2005, the remaining  proceeds  ($30.3 million  classified as Restricted  Cash at
December 31, 2004) had been used to purchase  ALLETE  common  stock,  which were
recorded using the treasury method as Unearned ESOP Shares within  Shareholders'
Equity as presented on our consolidated balance sheet.

In  September  2005,  the  ESOP's  independent  trustee  directed  the  sale  of
approximately 1.4 million shares of ADESA common stock that remained invested in
the RSOP participants'  ADESA common stock funds at September 1, 2005.  Proceeds
from the sale of the  ADESA  common  stock  were  $30.4  million,  of which  the
majority  was used to purchase  ALLETE  common stock as required by the terms of
the RSOP. The process was completed on October 26, 2005. Proceeds totaling $28.5
million were used to purchase a total of 644,450  shares of ALLETE  common stock
(289,900 shares in September 2005; 354,550 shares in October 2005).

Pursuant  to AICPA  Statement  of  Position  93-6,  "Employers'  Accounting  for
Employee Stock Ownership Plans,"  unallocated ALLETE common stock currently held
and  purchased  by the ESOP will be  treated  as  unearned  ESOP  shares and not
considered as outstanding for earnings per share  computations.  ESOP shares are
included  in  earnings  per  share  computations  after  they are  allocated  to
participants.

STOCK  OPTION  AND  AWARD  PLANS.  We  have  an  Executive  Long-Term  Incentive
Compensation  Plan  (Executive  Plan)  that  allows  for the  grant of up to 3.2
million shares of our common stock to key employees.  To date, these grants have
taken the form of stock options,  performance  share awards and restricted stock
awards.  Stock options are  exercisable  at the market price of common shares on
the date the  options are granted  and vest in equal  annual  installments  over
three years,  with expiration ten years from the date of the grant.  Performance
shares are earned  over  multi-year  time  periods and are  contingent  upon the
attainment of certain  performance goals of ALLETE.  Restricted stock vests once
certain  periods of time have elapsed.  At December 31, 2005, 1.1 million shares
were held in reserve for future issuance under the Executive Plan.

We had a Director  Long-Term  Stock Incentive Plan (Director Plan) which expired
on January 1, 2006. No grants have been made since 2003 under the Director Plan.
Approximately 9,900 options were outstanding at December 31, 2005.

The  employee  stock  options  outstanding  at the  date  of the  spin-off  were
converted to reflect the spin-off and  one-for-three  reverse stock split.  This
conversion was done to preserve the noncompensatory  nature of the options under
FASB Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation."

At December 31,  2005,  options  outstanding  consisted of less than 0.1 million
with exercise  prices  ranging from $15.88 to $18.85,  0.1 million with exercise
prices  ranging  from  $23.79 to $29.79 and 0.2  million  with  exercise  prices
ranging from $37.76 to $41.35.  The options with  exercise  prices  ranging from
$23.79 to $29.79 have an average  remaining  contractual life of 5.7 years, with
0.1 million  exercisable  on December 31, 2005,  at a weighted  average price of
$26.85.  The options with exercise  prices ranging from $37.76 to $41.35 have an
average  remaining  contractual  life of 8.6 years,  with less than 0.1  million
exercisable on December 31, 2005 at a weighted average price of $37.87.

Less than 0.1 million performance share grants were awarded in February 2005 for
performance periods ending in 2007. The ultimate issuance is contingent upon the
attainment of certain future  performance goals of ALLETE during the performance
periods.  The grant date fair  value of the  performance  share  awards was $1.0
million.

A total of 0.1 million  performance  share grants were awarded in February  2004
for the  performance  periods ended  December 31, 2005 and 2006.  The grant date
fair  value of the share  awards  was $1.6  million.  Performance  share  grants
related to the 2005 period will be issued in early 2006.

In February  2006, we granted  stock  options to purchase 0.1 million  shares of
common stock (exercise price of $44.15 per share).

EMPLOYEE  STOCK  PURCHASE  PLAN.  We have an Employee  Stock  Purchase Plan that
permits eligible  employees to buy up to $23,750 per year of our common stock at
95% of the market  price.  At December  31,  2005,  0.5 million  shares had been
issued  under the plan and 0.1  million  shares  were held in reserve for future
issuance.
