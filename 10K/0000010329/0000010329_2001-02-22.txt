ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
         (dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

         GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

         Bassett Furniture Industries, Incorporated (the "Company") was
         incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1930.
         The executive offices are located in Bassett, Virginia.

         Material Changes in the Development of Business in the last five
         years are as follows:

         In an effort to structure manufacturing capacity to current business
         demands and in a more efficient manner, the Company made a decision
         in late 2000 to consolidate production in our Wood Division. This
         included transferring certain products to different facilities,
         reducing one facility to rough-end operations only, and eliminating
         approximately 300 salaried and hourly positions. As a result, the
         Company recorded a restructuring charge in 2000 of $6,680, of which,
         $5,800 related to the write-down of property and equipment and $880
         related to severance and related employee benefits costs.

         Early in fiscal year 2000, the Company merged all of its eight
         Company-owned Bassett Furniture Direct (BFD) stores with a licensee's
         five BFD stores to form a joint venture known as the LRG Furniture,
         LLC ("LRG"). Refer to Note G of the Consolidated Financial Statements
         included in the Annual Report for more information about the joint
         venture.

         During 1999 the Company expanded its BFD retail store concept by
         adding five corporate owned stores to its existing network of
         licensee operated stores. Additionally, the Company took over
         operations of two financially troubled BFD stores operated by
         licensees.

         During 1999, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of its
         Bedding Division to Premier Bedding Group LLC ("PBG"). The net assets
         sold, which totaled $8,400, were exchanged for $6,500 in cash and a
         $1,900 convertible note receivable. Refer to Note B of the
         Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report for
         more information about the bedding sale.

         During 1997, the Company commenced the restructuring of certain of
         its operations and recorded restructuring and impaired asset charges
         of $20,646. The restructuring plan was the result of management's
         decision to focus on its core Bassett product line and efforts to
         improve operating efficiencies. The principal actions of the plan
         included the closure or sale of fourteen manufacturing facilities,
         elimination of three product lines (National/Mt. Airy, Impact and
         veneer production) and the severance of approximately 1,000
         employees.

         Refer to Note N of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
         the Annual Report for a detail of restructuring activity and refer to
         the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of the Annual Report
         for additional discussion on these topics.


         OPERATING SEGMENTS

         The Company's primary business is in wholesale home furnishings. The
         wholesale home furnishings business is involved principally in the
         manufacture, sale and distribution of furniture products to a network
         of independently owned stores and stores owned by an affiliate of the
         Company. The wholesale business consists primarily of two operating
         segments, wood and upholstery.

         Refer to Note R of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
         the Annual Report for more information about segment information for
         1998, 1999 and 2000 and refer to the Management's Discussion and
         Analysis section of the Annual Report for additional discussion on
         this topic.

                                                                        PAGE 3

         DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
         The Company is a manufacturer of quality home furnishings and sells a
         full range of furniture products and accessories through department
         and furniture stores and an exclusive network of retail stores, some
         of which are owned by an affiliate while others are
         independently-owned. Retail stores are located throughout the United
         States. The Company has thirteen manufacturing facilities throughout
         the United States.

         The wood segment is engaged in the manufacture and sale of wood
         furniture, including bedroom and dining suites and accent pieces, to
         independent retailers and a retailer, which is an affiliate of the
         Company. The wood segment accounted for 70%, 66% and 59% of total net
         sales during 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The Company currently
         has nine wood manufacturing facilities. The upholstery segment is
         involved in the manufacture and sale of upholstered frames and cut
         upholstery items having a variety of frame and fabric options,
         including sofas, chairs, and love seats. The Company currently has
         three upholstery manufacturing facilities. The upholstery segment
         accounted for 27%, 27% and 28% of total net sales during 2000, 1999
         and 1998, respectively.

         Raw materials used by the Company are generally available from
         numerous sources and are obtained principally from domestic sources.
         The Company has experienced slight raw materials cost pressures,
         namely certain lumber species, in 2000.

         The Company's trademarks , including "Bassett" and the names of its
         marketing divisions, products and collections are significant to the
         conduct of its business. This importance is due to consumer
         recognition of the names and identification with the Company's broad
         range of products. Certain of the Company's trademarks are licensed
         to independent retailers for use in full store presentations and in
         store gallery presentations of the Company's products. The Company
         also owns certain patents and licenses that are important in the
         conduct of the Company's business.

         The furniture industry in which the Company competes is not
         considered to be a seasonal industry. However, working capital levels
         will fluctuate based on overall business conditions, and desired
         service levels. Further, the Company's transition to more BFD stores
         has led to increased levels of inventories and accounts receivable.

         Sales to one customer (JC Penney Company) amounted to approximately
         16% of gross sales in 2000, 16% and 15% of gross sales in 1999 and
         1998, respectively. Additionally, sales to LRG Furniture, LLC (LRG),
         an affiliate of the Company, were 7% of total sales in 2000. The
         Company's backlog of orders believed to be firm was at $22,000 at
         November 25, 2000 and $32,000 at November 27, 1999. It is expected
         that the November 25, 2000 backlog will be filled within the 2001
         fiscal year.

         The furniture industry is very competitive and there are a large
         number of manufacturers both within the United States and offshore
         who compete in the market on the basis of product quality, price,
         style, delivery and service. Additionally, certain retailers are
         increasingly sourcing imported product directly thus bypassing
         domestic furniture manufacturers. Based on annual sales revenue, the
         Company is one of the largest furniture manufacturers located in the
         United States. The Company has been successful in this competitive
         environment because its products represent excellent value combining
         attractive prices, quality and styling; prompt delivery; and
         courteous service.

         The furniture industry is considered to be a "fashion" industry
         subject to constant fluctuations to meet changing consumer
         preferences and tastes. As such, the Company is continuously involved
         in the development of new designs and products. Due to the nature of
         these efforts and the close relationship to the manufacturing
         operations, these costs are considered normal operating costs and are
         not segregated. The Company is not otherwise involved in
         "traditional" research and development activities nor does the
         Company sponsor research and development activities of any of its
         customers.

         In management's view, the Company has complied in all material
         respects with all federal, state and local standards in the area of
         safety, health and pollution and environmental controls. Compliance
         with these standards did result in a charge to earnings in 1997 and
         capital spending in 1998 and

                                                                        PAGE 4



         1999, but otherwise, has not had a material adverse effect on past
         earnings or competitive position. The Company is involved in
         environmental matters at certain of its plant facilities, which arise
         in the normal course of business. Although the final outcome of these
         environmental matters cannot be determined, based on the facts
         presently known, it is management's opinion that the final resolution
         of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
         Company's financial position or future results of operations.

         The Company had approximately 4,100 employees at November 25, 2000.

         The Company has several investments in affiliated companies,
         including a minority interest in International Home Furnishings
         Center, Inc. (IHFC) which is a lessor of permanent exhibition space
         to furniture and accessory manufacturers. The IHFC financial
         statements are included on pages F-1 to F-13. The Company owns a
         majority interest in The Bassett Industries Alternative Asset Fund,
         LP, which invests in a variety of other private partnerships,
         employing a combination of investment strategies. The Bassett
         Industries Alternative Asset Fund's year ended on December 31, 2000,
         as such its financial statements have not been included in this Form
         10-K. Form 10-K will be amended to include such statements when
         available. The Company owns a majority interest in LRG Furniture,
         LLC, (LRG), which is a retailer of home furnishings. The LRG
         financial statements are included on pages F-14 to F-24.

         FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES

         The Company has no foreign operations, and its export sales were
         approximately $4.9 million, $10.6 million, and $14.3 million in 2000,
         1999, and 1998 respectively.

  ITEM 3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         A suit was filed in June 1997, in California against the Company, two
         major retailers and certain current and former employees of the
         Company. Following the dismissal of the class action allegations
         contained in such suit, the suit consisted of damage claims by nine
         named plantiffs, together with restitution claims for other
         purchasers under California Business & Professions Code 17200 which
         were dismissed subsequent to the end of the fiscal year.

         Legislation has phased out interest deductions on certain policy
         loans related to Company owned life insurance (COLI) as of January 1,
         1999. The Company has recorded cumulative reductions to income tax
         expense of approximately $8,000 as the result of COLI interest
         deductions through 1998. The Internal Revenue Service, on a national
         level, has pursued an adverse position regarding the deductibility of
         COLI policy loan interest for years prior to January 1, 1999. The IRS
         has received favorable rulings on the non-deductibility of COLI loan
         interest. Management understands that these rulings and the adverse
         position taken by the IRS will be subjected to extensive challenges
         in court. In the event that the IRS prevails, the outcome could
         result in potential income tax and interest payments which could be
         material to the Company's future results of operations.

         The Company is also involved in various other claims and actions,
         including environmental matters, which arise in the normal course of
         business. Although the final outcome of these matters cannot be
         determined, based on the facts presently known, it is management's
         opinion that the final resolution of these matters will not have a
         material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or future
         results of operations.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



To the Board of Directors
International Home Furnishings Center, Inc.
High Point, North Carolina


We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of International Home
Furnishings Center, Inc. as of October 31, 2000 and 1999 and the related
statements of income, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended October 31, 2000. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of International Home Furnishings
Center, Inc. at October 31, 2000 and 1999 and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2000
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

INTERNATIONAL HOME FURNISHINGS CENTER, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER 31, 2000, 1999 AND 1998
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE A - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

The Company is the lessor of permanent exhibition space to furniture and
accessory manufacturers which are headquartered throughout the United States and
in many foreign countries. This exhibition space, located in High Point, North
Carolina, is used by the Home Furnishings Industry to showcase its products at
the International Home Furnishings Market held each April and October. The
details of the operating leases with the Company's tenants are described in
Note I.

The Company has been in business since June 27, 1919, and operates under the
trade name of "International Home Furnishings Center."

NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies relative to the carrying values of property and
equipment and theater complex are indicated in the captions on the balance
sheets. Other significant accounting policies are as follows:

Rental Income

Income from rental of exhibition space is recognized under the operating method.
Aggregate rentals are reported as income on the straight-line basis over the
lives of the leases, and expenses are charged as incurred against such income.
Future rentals under existing leases are not recorded as assets in the
accompanying balance sheets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Investment Securities

The Company has investments in debt and marketable equity securities.  Debt
securities consist of obligations of state and local governments and U. S.
corporations.  Marketable equity securities consist primarily of investments
in mutual funds.

Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the date
individual investment securities are acquired, and the appropriateness of such
classification is reassessed at each balance sheet date. Since the Company
neither buys investment securities in anticipation of short-term fluctuations in
market prices or commits to holding debt securities to their maturities,
investments in debt and marketable equity securities have been classified as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, and
unrealized holding gains and losses, if significant, net of the related deferred
tax effect, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. Premiums and discounts on
investments in debt securities are amortized over their contractual lives.
Interest on debt securities is recognized in income as accrued, and dividends on
marketable equity securities are recognized in income when declared. Realized

NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Property, Equipment and Depreciation

Additions and major improvements to property and equipment are recorded at cost.
Expenditures for maintenance, repairs, and minor renewals are charged to expense
as incurred. Depreciation is provided primarily on the straight-line method over
the following estimated useful lives:

<TABLE>
<S>                                                                                                 <C>

              Building structures                                                             20 to 50 years
              Building components                                                              5 to 20 years
              Furniture and equipment                                                          3 to 10 years
</TABLE>

In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of," the Company periodically reviews long-lived assets
when indicators of impairment exist, and if the value of the assets is impaired,
an impairment loss would be recognized.

Deferred Financing Costs

Costs associated with obtaining the term loan disclosed in Note E have been
deferred and are being amortized on the straight-line method over the term of
the related debt. Amortization expense charged to operations during the years
ended October 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $83,530, $83,530 and $20,883,
respectively.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the
financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes
related to temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and their tax bases. The deferred tax assets and liabilities
represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will
either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or
settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of
changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

Earnings Per Common Share

The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share," which specifies the computation,
presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings per share ("EPS"). Basic
EPS excludes all dilution and has been computed using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS would reflect
the potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to
issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. The Company
has no dilutive potential common shares.

NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Retirement Plans

The Company maintains a 401(k) qualified retirement plan covering eligible
employees under which participants may contribute up to 25% of their
compensation subject to maximum allowable contributions. The Company is
obligated to contribute, on a matching basis, 50% of the first 6% of
compensation voluntarily contributed by participants. The Company may also make
additional contributions to the plan if it so elects.

In 1991, the Company adopted a nonqualified supplemental retirement benefits
plan for key management employees. Benefits payable under the plan are based
upon the participant's average compensation during his last five years of
employment and are reduced by benefits payable under the Company's qualified
retirement plan and by one-half of the participant's social security benefits.
Benefits under the plan do not vest until the attainment of normal retirement
age; however, a reduced benefit is payable if employment terminates prior to
normal retirement age because of death or disability. The Company has no
obligation to fund this supplemental plan.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

NOTE C - RESTRICTED CASH

Restricted cash consists of an interest-bearing debt service account. The
Company is required to make semi-annual escrow deposits each May and November in
amounts sufficient to provide interest and principal payments on the Company's
term debt for the ensuing six months.

NOTE G - LAND LEASE COMMITMENT

During 1975, the Company completed construction of an eleven-story exhibition
building. The building is constructed on land leased from the City of High
Point, North Carolina under a noncancelable lease. The lease is for an initial
term of fifty years with three options to renew for periods of ten years each
and a final renewal option for nineteen years. Annual rental under the lease is
$152,234 as of October 31, 2000 and is subject to adjustment at the end of each
five-year period, such adjustment being computed as defined in the lease
agreement. As part of the lease agreement, the Company constructed a theater
complex for public use and office space for use by the City of High Point on the
lower levels of the building. Annual rental cash payments over the initial
fifty-year lease term are being reduced by $39,121 which represents amortization
of the cost of the theater and office complex constructed for the City of High
Point. At the termination of the lease, the building becomes the property of the
City of High Point. Under the terms of the lease, the Company is responsible for
all expenses applicable to the exhibition portion of the building. The City of
High Point is responsible for all expenses applicable to the theater complex and
office space constructed for use by the City.

NOTE H - RETIREMENT EXPENSE

Amounts expensed under the Company's retirement plans amounted to $394,166,
$691,698 and $268,856 for the years ended October 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively, including $240,796, $541,136 and $159,350 under the supplemental
retirement benefits plan for the years ended October 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.


NOTE I - RENTALS UNDER OPERATING LEASES

The Company's leasing operations consist principally of leasing exhibition
space. Property on operating leases consists of substantially all of the asset
"buildings, exclusive of theater complex" included on the balance sheets.
Accumulated depreciation on this property amounted to $42,943,916 and
$40,937,431 at October 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Leases are typically for
five-year periods and contain provisions to escalate rentals based upon either
the increase in the consumer price index or increases in ad valorem taxes,
utility rates and charges, minimum wage imposed by federal and state
governments, maintenance contracts for elevators and air conditioning,
maintenance of common areas, social security payments, increases resulting from
collective bargaining contracts, if any, and such other similar charges and
rates required in operating the Company. Tenants normally renew their leases.

The following is a schedule of minimum future rentals under noncancelable
operating leases as of October 31, 2000, exclusive of amounts due under
escalation provisions of lease agreements:

of $823,536, $1,322,521 and $1,401,867 for the years ended October 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively. Rental income from related parties amounted to
$2,374,813, $1,980,775 and $1,894,219 for the years ended October 31, 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively.


NOTE J - CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of cash deposits in excess of federally insured
limits and trade accounts receivable from customers predominantly in the Home
Furnishings Industry. As of October 31, 2000, the Company's bank balances
exceeded federally insured limits by $1,105,376. The Company's trade accounts
receivable are generally collateralized by merchandise in leased exhibition
spaces which is in the Company's possession.

NOTE K - STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT

During the year ended October 31, 1998, the Company paid dividends of
$76,317,560 resulting in a deficit in stockholders' equity of $17,904,821 at
October 31, 1998. During the year ended October 31, 1999, the deficit was
increased because of the payment of dividends in excess of net income for the
year. The 1998 dividends were financed, in part, with the proceeds of a
$75,000,000 term loan. Although interest on this debt will negatively impact
future earnings, management believes future earnings will provide adequate
equity capital for the Company and that operating cash flows will be sufficient
to provide for debt service and for the Company's other financing and investing
needs.


NOTE L - CONSTRUCTION PLANS

At October 31, 2000, a project to add additional exhibition space to the
existing facilities was in progress. Construction is expected to be completed in
time for tenants to utilize the additional exhibition space for the April 2001
International Home Furnishings Market. The cost of the construction is estimated
to approximate $14,217,000 and is being funded with operating cash flows. As of
October 31, 2000, $11,569,301 of this amount had been incurred. The assessment
of the cost and the timetable for completion are management's estimates, and it
is reasonably possible that actual and estimated results will differ materially.

made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                           NOVEMBER 30, 2000 AND 1999



1.  HISTORY AND ORGANIZATION

     LRG Furniture, LLC (the Company) was formed as a limited liability company
     under the laws of Virginia on November 29, 1999. The Company was formed as
     a joint venture between Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc. (Bassett) and
     Bassett Direct Plus Texas, LLC (BDPT) (collectively referred to herein as
     the Members). Pursuant to the joint venture, Bassett contributed cash of
     $4,215,000, reimbursement for excessive customer deposit liability of
     $1,800,000 and other identifiable assets, at net book value of $8,593,000
     offset by liabilities of $8,948,000. Concurrently, BDPT contributed, at net
     book value, other identifiable assets of $5,659,000 offset by liabilities
     of $8,642,000. As a result of these transactions, Bassett and BDPT were
     credited with 51% and 49%, respectively, of the resulting combined equity
     of $2,677,000.

     The Company began operations on November 29, 1999, and had minimal activity
     between inception and November 30, 1999, its first fiscal year-end. As
     such, the financial statements for the period from November 29, 1999
     (inception), to November 30, 1999, are not material for a fair presentation
     of the Company's results of operations and financial position and have not
     been presented herein.

2.  OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     OPERATIONS

     The Company operates retail furniture stores in North Carolina, South
     Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Nevada and Texas. These stores operate under
     the "Bassett Furniture Direct" name and substantially all of their
     purchases are from Bassett and its affiliates.

     USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
     principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
     make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
     and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
     date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
     expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
     those estimates.

     CASH

     Cash includes cash on hand and cash in banks.

     REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

     The Company recognizes revenue upon the delivery of products to its
     customers. In the current year, there is no concentration of credit risk to
     any one customer. Return allowances are provided for estimated losses
     associated with anticipated future returns of products sold by the Company.
     Actual returns could differ from management's estimates making it
     reasonably possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the
     near term.

                                      -2-

     MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES


     Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out
     (FIFO) cost or market. Allowances are established to reduce the cost of
     excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value.


     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT


     Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided using
     the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:


<TABLE>
                <S>                                           <C>
                Computer equipment                            3-5 years
                Store fixtures                                  7 years
                Office furniture, fixtures and equipment        7 years
                Leasehold improvements                      15-20 years
                Vehicles                                        5 years
</TABLE>

     When property is sold or retired, the cost and accumulated depreciation are
     removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in
     the statement of operations and changes in members' equity. Expenditures
     for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.

     OTHER ASSETS

     Other assets are substantially made up of refundable deposits with various
     utilities and property lessors and a lease contract that has terms that are
     favorable to its local market value. The deposits are refundable at the
     discretion of the utility or lessor as applicable and the favorable lease
     contract is amortized over the lease term, which is 15 years. Accumulated
     amortization related to this favorable lease contract was $53,568 and $0 in
     2000 and 1999, respectively.

     LONG-LIVED ASSETS

     The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
     121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
     Assets to be Disposed Of," which requires that long-lived assets and
     certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used or disposed of
     by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
     circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
     recoverable. In the event assets are impaired, losses are recognized based
     on the excess carrying amounts over the estimated undiscounted cash flows
     for the asset. SFAS No. 121 also requires that assets to be disposed of be
     reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair market value less
     selling costs. At November 30, 2000, the Company noted an impairment loss
     related to one store for $97,000 (Note 10). No other impairment losses have
     been identified by the Company as of November 30, 2000.

     PREOPENING EXPENSES

     Preopening expenses, which consist primarily of payroll and occupancy
     costs, are expensed as incurred. Preopening expenses were $449,534 in 2000.

     ADVERTISING COSTS

     The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense was
     $1,949,344 in 2000.

                                      -3-

     CUSTOMER DEPOSITS

     Customer deposits relate to amounts paid by customers to the Company at the
     time they order goods. These deposits are applied to the ultimate sales
     price once goods are shipped to the customer, and are recognized as revenue
     at that time.

     INCOME TAXES

     The Company is treated as a pass-through entity for federal income tax
     purposes. As a result, the Company is not subject to income tax, but rather
     the liability for income taxes from the taxable income generated by the
     Company is the obligation of the owners of the Company. The Company is
     treated similarly for state income tax purposes and, under current law in
     the states in which the Company is conducting business, the Company is not
     subject to state income taxes. Accordingly, no provision or benefit for
     federal and state income taxes has been recorded in the accompanying
     financial statements.

     RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In June 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 138,
     "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
     Activities." This statement amends the accounting and reporting standards
     of Statement No. 133 for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging
     activities. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for
     derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded
     in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives), and for
     hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as
     either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and
     measure those instruments at fair value. The Company has adopted the
     provisions of this statement in 2001 and has determined that the impact of
     adopting the statement is immaterial.


3.   CONTINUING OPERATIONS

     The Company has experienced significant losses from operations during 2000.
     The Company incurred a net loss in 2000 of $9,584,000, and has Members'
     deficit of $6,907,000 as of November 30, 2000. Management has implemented a
     profit improvement program that includes evaluation and realignment of the
     Company's business to improve profitability. This program has resulted in
     significant operational changes, overall downsizing of the Company's
     administrative and operating overhead and disposals of selected stores
     (Note 10). As a result of these actions, the Company expects to reduce its
     losses substantially in 2001.

     The Members have historically provided, and are currently providing,
     sufficient financial support to the Company to fund the Company's
     obligations and working capital requirements as those obligations become
     due. The Members loaned a total of $7,808,000 to the Company in 2000 (Note
     4).

     The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern
     basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of
     liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business, rather than
     through a process of forced liquidation. Management of Bassett has
     committed to provide the necessary level of financial support to the
     Company to enable it to pay its obligations as they become due through
     November 30, 2002. Bassett, however, is not legally obligated to provide
     such support. Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements do not
     include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
     of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities
     that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going
     concern.

</TABLE>

     At various dates from March 16, 2000, to August 15, 2000, the Company
     entered into a total of eight unsecured notes with a bank for $606,000 each
     for a total of $4,848,000. Each note has deferred principal payments of
     $22,444 beginning 9 months from the close of each note and continuing for
     27 months thereafter. The proceeds of these notes were used primarily to
     pay for new store opening inventory. Repayment of these loans is guaranteed
     by Bassett.

     On June 1, 2000, and August 1, 2000, the Company entered into two unsecured
     notes with Bassett for $1,000,000 and $5,000,000, respectively. Both of
     these notes have the same terms and both have deferred principal and
     interest payments, all payable November 1, 2004.

     On November 30, 2000, the Company entered into an unsecured note with BDPT
     for $1,808,000. This unsecured note contains various restrictive covenants,
     which include, among others, limitations on loans and contingent
     liabilities except in the normal course of business. As of November 30,
     2000, the Company was in compliance with all of these covenants.

5.   LEASE COMMITMENTS

     The Company's administrative offices and retail locations are leased under
     noncancellable operating lease agreements that expire from 2001 to 2020.
     Most of these leases contain renewal options of 3 to 35 years. Certain of
     the lease agreements for retail locations require the payment of contingent
     rentals based on a percentage of sales above stipulated levels. No
     contingent rental expense was incurred during 2000. Certain of the lease
     agreements contain rent escalation clauses. Total rent expense for 2000 was
     $6,201,000. The Company leases certain of these locations from the Members.
     Rent expense related to locations owned or leased from the Members was
     $3,823,000 in 2000.

</TABLE>

     Subsequent to November 30, 2000, the Company entered into a lease agreement
     for one new store that was purchased by the Company from a third-party
     "Bassett Furniture Direct" licensee (Note 10). This lease is a
     month-to-month lease and as such does not appear in the future minimum
     lease commitments above.

     Also subsequent to November 30, 2000, the Company sold three stores to
     third parties and these third parties assumed the leases related to these
     stores (Note 10). As such, the lease commitments related to these three
     stores are not included in the future minimum lease commitments above.

6.   OTHER RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     Substantially all purchases of merchandise inventories are made from
     Bassett and its affiliates. These related entities sell products to the
     Company at prices equal to their normal selling prices to unrelated
     entities. Accounts payable due to these related parties was $10,534,450 and
     $2,462,152 in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     Interest expense on borrowings from related parties as described in Note 4
     was $173,333 in 2000 and was accrued at November 30, 2000.

     The Company paid salaries to related parties for administrative and
     executive services for $300,000 in 2000.

7.   BENEFIT PLAN

     EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN

     The Company maintains a qualified 401(k) employee savings plan covering
     substantially all full-time employees. Under the plan, employees may elect
     to contribute up to 15% of their compensation annually. Under the plan, the
     Company is not required to make contributions to the plan and no
     contributions were made in 2000.

8.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

     The Company has certain obligations under various employment agreements
     through November 30, 2004, that stipulate, among other things, certain
     levels of compensation, bonus potential, other miscellaneous benefits and
     severance arrangements. Potential contingent liabilities under these
     arrangements approximate $450,000.

     LITIGATION

     The Company is involved in various legal proceedings encountered in the
     normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the resolution of
     these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
     financial position or future results of operations.

9.   MEMBERS' EQUITY (DEFICIT)

     The Members' equity (deficit) account in the accompanying balance sheets
     reflects the initial capital contributed by the Members of $2,677,489 and
     all losses of the Company since inception. No distributions have been made
     to the Members since inception. Under the terms of the Limited Liability
     Company Agreement (the LLC Agreement), profits and losses and any
     distributions of the Company are allocated to its members based upon the
     Members' relative ownership interests in the Company and are made at the
     sole discretion of the Board of Managers. Both members have two positions
     each in the Board of Managers. There is a single class of members with the
     same rights, powers, duties, obligations, preferences and privileges. Each
     member's liability is limited to the sum of its capital contributions, its
     share of any undistributed assets of the Company, and any amounts
     previously distributed to it from the Company.

     As stated in the Articles of Organization, the latest date on which the
     Company is to dissolve is November 30, 2019.

10.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     In December 2000, the Company sold its retail store operation in Columbia,
     South Carolina, to a local furniture retailer. The transaction involved the
     sale of inventory, property, equipment and leasehold improvements. The
     buyer also assumed the customer deposit liability and the future lease
     commitments for the store facility. The Company incurred a loss of $97,000
     primarily related to the disposal of property and equipment. As management
     made the decision to dispose of this store before year-end and had
     knowledge that the book value of the property exceeded fair value at
     year-end, management accrued for these impaired assets in the accompanying
     financial statements.

     The Company sold its retail furniture store in Knoxville, Tennessee, in
     January 2001. Substantially all of the inventory in that location had been
     sold through a liquidation sale that began in September 2000. The lease for
     this location has been assumed by a third party, who will operate the store
     as a "Bassett Furniture Direct" store going forward. No significant gain or
     loss was realized due to this transaction.

     On December 15, 2000, the Company purchased assets and assumed liabilities
     of a third party "Bassett Furniture Direct" licensee in Louisville,
     Kentucky. As part of the transaction, Bassett purchased the related
     building and is leasing it to the Company on a month-to-month basis. The
     Company will operate the facility as a retail furniture store on an ongoing
     basis.
