                                     PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
           (dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

           GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

           Bassett Furniture Industries Inc., ("Bassett" or the "Company") based
           in Bassett, Va., is a leading manufacturer and marketer of branded
           home furnishings. Bassett's products, designed to provide quality,
           style and value, are sold through Bassett Furniture Direct(TM)
           stores, @t Home with Bassett(R) galleries, and other furniture and
           department stores. Bassett was founded in 1902 and incorporated under
           the laws of Virginia in 1930.

           Material Changes in the Development of Business in the last five
           years are as follows:

           The Bassett Furniture Direct store program, which began in 1997,
           entailed not only the creation of a new prototype store, but also
           includes an internal, cultural transformation aimed at re-focusing
           company practices and strategies to the ultimate end user, the
           consumer. The strategy also focused on re-styling the Bassett lines
           and suites with accessories. Bassett Furniture Direct acts as both a
           furniture design center and a moderate price point leader - two
           characteristics that combined with custom product and quick delivery
           offer the Company a unique selling proposition in the furniture
           industry.

           There have been two significant business developments that have
           materially affected the Company's operations over the last five
           years. First, the Company has created and re-channeled sales through
           a vertically integrated retail sales network. This strategy both
           builds on the Company's strengths (brand name, balance sheet, product
           offerings) and better positions the Company to capitalize on the
           changing furniture retail environment. The independently owned
           licensee stores, known as Bassett Furniture Direct, accounted for 45%
           of the Company's sales in 2002. There were 85 stores operating at
           November 30, 2002. Second, the Company has restructured production
           capacities and eliminated costs to closely align manufacturing
           capabilities with the Company's target markets. These efforts have
           resulted in the elimination of approximately 4,200 salaried and
           hourly positions over the last five years.

           The Company closed its California upholstery plant during the fourth
           quarter of 2002 and consolidated production in its two remaining
           upholstery manufacturing facilities in North Carolina. The Company
           incurred restructuring charges of $1,251, which relate entirely to
           severance and employee benefit costs for approximately 200 employees.

           Effective March 4, 2002, the Company purchased five stores in North
           Carolina and Virginia from LRG Furniture, LLC, an affiliate of the
           Company, for net book value (which approximated $0). Included in this
           transaction were inventories of $3,439, payables of $4,213 and notes
           payable to bank of $1,189.

           Subsequent to November 30, 2002, the Company announced that it would
           close its wood manufacturing plant in Dublin, Georgia, in order to
           better match production capacity to current demand levels. The
           Company anticipates recording a charge of approximately $3,200 in the
           first quarter of 2003 representing a $1,500 write-down of property
           and equipment and $1,700 of severance and related employee benefit
           costs for 320 employees associated with the closure.

           The Company restructured production capacities for its Wood Division
           in 2001. During the first quarter, production was moved from one
           facility to another and a wood manufacturing facility was identified
           for closure and was subsequently closed in the second quarter.
           Additionally, 60 corporate office positions were eliminated in the
           first and second quarters of 2001. Ongoing efforts to match
           production with demand, offer more competitively priced products and
           operate more efficient manufacturing facilities resulted in the
           announcement and subsequent closure of
<PAGE>
                                                                          PAGE 3

           two additional facilities in Bassett, Virginia during the third
           quarter of 2001. Production has been moved to other manufacturing
           facilities in Virginia or has been outsourced. Approximately 800
           positions were eliminated as a result of this restructuring activity.
           Restructuring charges of $6,952 were recognized in 2001. The Company
           also recorded unusual and non-recurring charges of $1,051 for
           inventory losses related to discontinued product. This amount is
           included in 2001 cost of sales.

           The Company made a decision in late 2000 to consolidate production in
           its Wood Division. This included transferring certain products to
           different facilities, reducing one facility to rough-end operations
           only, and eliminating approximately 300 salaried and hourly
           positions. As a result, the Company recorded a restructuring charge
           in 2000 of $6,680, of which, $5,800 related to the write-down of
           property and equipment and $880 related to severance and related
           employee benefits costs.

           Early in fiscal year 2000, the Company merged all of its eight
           Company-owned Bassett Furniture Direct (BFD) stores with a licensee's
           five BFD stores to form a joint venture known as the LRG Furniture,
           LLC ("LRG"). Refer to Note F of the Consolidated Financial Statements
           included in the Annual Report for more information about the joint
           venture.

           During 1999, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of its
           Bedding Division to Premier Bedding Group LLC ("PBG"). The net assets
           sold, which totaled $8,400, were exchanged for $6,500 in cash and a
           $1,900 convertible note receivable. Refer to Note B of the
           Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report for
           more information about the bedding sale.

           Refer to Note M of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
           the Annual Report for a detail of restructuring activity and refer to
           the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of the Annual Report
           for additional discussion on these topics.

           OPERATING SEGMENTS

           The Company's primary business is in wholesale home furnishings. The
           wholesale home furnishings business is involved principally in the
           manufacture, sale and distribution of furniture products to a network
           of independently owned stores and stores owned by the Company and by
           affiliates of the Company. The wholesale business consists primarily
           of three operating segments: wood, upholstery and import. Stores
           operated by the Company are included in the retail segment.

           Refer to Note R of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
           the Annual Report for more information about segment information for
           2000, 2001 and 2002 and refer to the Management's Discussion and
           Analysis section of the Annual Report for additional discussion on
           this topic.

           DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
           Bassett Furniture Industries, Incorporated (together with its
           consolidated subsidiaries, "Bassett" or the "Company") is a
           manufacturer, retailer and importer of quality home furnishings.
           Bassett's full range of furniture products and accessories are sold
           through an exclusive network of 79 independently owned and six
           company-owned retail stores known as Bassett Furniture Direct ("BFD")
           and over 2,000 furniture and department stores located throughout the
           United States. The Company has nine domestic manufacturing
           facilities.

           The wood segment is engaged in the manufacture and sale of wood
           furniture, including bedroom and dining suites and accent pieces, to
           independent and affiliated retailers. The wood segment accounted for
           49%, 57% and 62% of total net sales during 2002, 2001 and 2000,
           respectively. The Company currently has six wood manufacturing
           facilities. The upholstery segment is involved in the manufacture and
           sale of upholstered frames and cut upholstery items having a variety
           of frame and fabric options, including sofas, chairs, and love seats.
           The Company
<PAGE>
                                                                          PAGE 4

           currently has two upholstery manufacturing facilities. The upholstery
           segment accounted for 32%, 29% and 27% of total net sales during
           2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The import segment sources
           product, principally from Asia, and sells this product to independent
           and affiliated retailers. The import segment accounted for 13%, 11%
           and 8% of total net sales during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
           The retail segment operates six Bassett Furniture Direct stores in
           North Carolina and Virginia acquired in 2001 and 2002. The retail
           segment accounted for 5% of total net sales in 2002.

           Raw materials used by the Company are generally available from
           numerous sources and are obtained from domestic and foreign sources.
           The Company sources component parts from overseas markets when it is
           economically advantageous. The Company currently assembles and
           finishes these imported components in several of its plants in the
           United States.

           The Company's trademarks, including "Bassett" and the names of its
           marketing divisions, products and collections are significant to the
           conduct of its business. This importance is due to consumer
           recognition of the names and identification with the Company's broad
           range of products. Certain of the Company's trademarks are licensed
           to independent retailers for use in full store presentations and in
           store gallery presentations of the Company's products. The Company
           also owns certain patents and licenses that are important in the
           conduct of the Company's business.

           The furniture industry in which the Company competes is not
           considered to be a seasonal industry. However, working capital levels
           will fluctuate based on overall business conditions, and desired
           service levels.

           Sales to one customer (JCPenney Company) amounted to approximately
           9%, 15% and 16% of gross sales in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
           Additionally, sales to LRG Furniture, LLC ("LRG"), an affiliate of
           the Company, were 7%, 10% and 7% of net sales in 2002, 2001, and
           2000, respectively. The Company's backlog of orders believed to be
           firm was $18,014 at November 30, 2002 and $19,000 at November 24,
           2001. It is expected that the November 30, 2002 backlog will be
           filled within the 2003 fiscal year.

           The furniture industry is very competitive and there are a large
           number of manufacturers both within the United States and offshore
           who compete in the market on the basis of product quality, price,
           style, delivery and service. Additionally, certain retailers are
           increasingly sourcing imported product directly, thus bypassing
           domestic furniture manufacturers. Based on annual sales revenue, the
           Company is one of the largest furniture manufacturers located in the
           United States. The Company has been successful in this competitive
           environment because its products represent excellent value combining
           attractive prices, quality and styling; prompt delivery; and
           courteous service.

           The furniture industry is considered to be a "fashion" industry
           subject to constant fluctuations to meet changing consumer
           preferences and tastes. As such, the Company is continuously involved
           in the development of new designs and products. Due to the nature of
           these efforts and the close relationship to the manufacturing
           operations, these costs are considered normal operating costs and are
           not segregated. The Company is not otherwise involved in
           "traditional" research and development activities nor does the
           Company sponsor research and development activities of any of its
           customers.

           In management's view, the Company has complied in all material
           respects with all federal, state and local standards in the area of
           safety, health and pollution and environmental controls. Compliance
           with these standards did result in a charge to earnings in 1997 and
           capital spending in 1998 and 1999, but otherwise, has not had a
           material adverse effect on past earnings or competitive position. The
           Company is involved in environmental matters at certain of its plant
           facilities, which arise in the normal course of business. Although
           the final outcome of these
<PAGE>

                                                                          PAGE 5

           environmental matters cannot be determined, based on the facts
           presently known, it is management's opinion that the final resolution
           of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
           Company's financial position or future results of operations.

           The Company had approximately 2,700 employees at November 30, 2002.

           The Company has several investments in affiliated companies,
           including a minority interest in International Home Furnishings
           Center, Inc. (IHFC) which is a lessor of permanent exhibition space
           to furniture and accessory manufacturers. The IHFC financial
           statements are included on pages F-1 to F-15. The Company owns a
           majority interest in LRG Furniture, LLC, (LRG), which is a retailer
           of home furnishings. The LRG financial statements are included on
           pages F-16 to F-28.

           FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES

           The Company has no foreign operations, and its export sales were
           approximately $2.9 million, $3.2 million, and $4.9 million in 2002,
           2001, and 2000 respectively.

           In general, these facilities are suitable and are considered to be
           adequate for the continuing operations involved. All facilities,

           adequate capacity for the Company's manufacturing needs.

  ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

           Subsequent to November 30, 2002, the Company reached a final
           settlement with the IRS regarding the non-deductibility of interest
           expense on loans associated with the Company's corporate owned life
           insurance plan ("COLI" plan). The Company had sufficient reserves on
           hand at November 30, 2002 to cover the negotiated settlement amount
           and, as such, there will be no further tax related charges associated
           with the COLI.

           The Company is also involved in various claims and actions, including
           environmental matters, which arise in the normal course of business.
           Although the final outcome of these matters cannot be determined,
           based on the facts presently known, it is management's opinion that
           the final resolution of these matters will not have a material
           adverse effect on the Company's financial position or future results
           of operations.

ITEM 13.   CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

           None.

ITEM 14.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

a.         Quarterly evaluation of the Company's Disclosure Controls. Within the
           90 days prior to the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the
           Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of
           its "disclosure controls and procedures" ("Disclosure Controls").
           Disclosure Controls are procedures that are designed with the
           objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in
           our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
           "Exchange Act"), such as this Annual Report, is recorded, processed,
           summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
           Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules and forms.
           Disclosure Controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring
           that such


<PAGE>
                                                                         PAGE 11


           information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
           including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
           regarding required disclosure.

           The Company's management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect
           that our Disclosure Controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A
           control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
           provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
           of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
           system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
           the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
           Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
           evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
           control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company
           have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
           that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
           can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any
           system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions
           about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
           that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
           potential future conditions.

           Based upon our controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded
           that, subject to the limitations noted above, our Disclosure Controls
           are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed
           by the Company in its periodic reports is accumulated and
           communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as
           appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure and is
           recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
           specified in the SEC's rules and forms.

b.         Changes in internal controls. There have been no significant changes
           in the Company's internal controls or in other factors that could
           significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of the
           controls evaluation.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



To the Board of Directors
International Home Furnishings Center, Inc.
High Point, North Carolina


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of International
Home Furnishings Center, Inc. and subsidiary as of October 31, 2002 and 2001 and
the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity (deficit),
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2002.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of International Home
Furnishings Center, Inc. and subsidiary at October 31, 2002 and 2001 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended October 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

INTERNATIONAL HOME FURNISHINGS CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE A - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

The Company is the lessor of permanent exhibition space to furniture and
accessory manufacturers which are headquartered throughout the United States and
in many foreign countries. This exhibition space, located in High Point, North
Carolina, is used by the Home Furnishings Industry to showcase its products at
the International Home Furnishings Market held each April and October. The
details of the operating leases with the Company's tenants are described in Note
I.

The Company has been in business since June 27, 1919, and operates under the
trade name of "International Home Furnishings Center."


NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies relative to the carrying values of property and
equipment, theater complex and interest rate cap and floor agreements are
indicated in the captions on the consolidated balance sheets. Other significant
accounting policies are as follows:

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of International Home
Furnishings Center, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, IHFC Properties,
L.L.C., a company organized on December 21, 2000. All material intercompany
transactions have been eliminated. The Company and its subsidiary are referred
to collectively herein as "the Company." Notwithstanding the consolidation of
the Company and IHFC Properties, L.L.C. in these financial statements, IHFC
Properties, L.L.C. is a separate entity, with separate assets and liabilities
and has its own separate financial statements.

Rental Income

Income from rental of exhibition space is recognized under the operating method.
Aggregate rentals are reported as income on the straight-line basis over the
lives of the leases, and expenses are charged as incurred against such income.
Future rentals under existing leases are not recorded as assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Investment Securities

The Company has investments in debt and marketable equity securities. Debt
securities consist of obligations of state and local governments and U. S.
corporations. Marketable equity securities consist primarily of investments in
mutual funds.


                                                                          Page 7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Investment Securities (Continued)

Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the date
individual investment securities are acquired, and the appropriateness of such
classification is reassessed at each balance sheet date. Since the Company
neither buys investment securities in anticipation of short-term fluctuations in
market prices nor commits to holding debt securities to their maturities,
investments in debt and marketable equity securities have been classified as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, and
unrealized holding gains and losses, if significant, net of the related deferred
tax effect, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. Premiums and discounts on
investments in debt securities are amortized over their contractual lives.
Interest on debt securities is recognized in income as accrued, and dividends on
marketable equity securities are recognized in income when declared. Realized
gains and losses are included in income and are determined on the basis of the
specific securities sold.

Property, Equipment and Depreciation

Expenditures for maintenance, repairs, and minor renewals are charged to expense
as incurred. Major renewals and betterments are capitalized. Depreciation is
provided primarily on the straight-line method over the following estimated
useful lives:

In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of," the Company periodically reviews long-lived assets
when indications of impairment exist, and if the value of the assets is
impaired, an impairment loss would be recognized.

Deferred Financing Costs

Costs associated with obtaining long-term financing have been deferred and are
being amortized on the interest method over the term of the related debt.
Amortization expense charged to operations during the years ended October 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000 was $613,042, $522,725 and $83,530, respectively.

Reporting Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income is the total of net income and other comprehensive income.
Other comprehensive income represents changes in equity, other than net income,
from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.
Accordingly, comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a period
except those resulting from investments by stockholders and distributions to
stockholders.

NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Derivative Instruments

The Company holds and issues derivative instruments for the purpose of hedging
the risks related to the variability of cash flows caused by changes in interest
rates. The Company's objectives are to decrease the volatility of earnings and
cash flows associated with changing interest rates by entering into interest
rate floor and cap agreements that effectively limit the range of interest rate
exposure on its debt (see Note E).

The Company designates its derivatives based upon criteria established by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). For a derivative
designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain
or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and
subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects
earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings
immediately.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the
consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus
deferred taxes related to temporary differences between the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and their tax bases. The deferred tax assets and
liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences,
which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are
recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the
effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

Earnings Per Common Share

The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share," which specifies the computation,
presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings per share ("EPS"). Basic
EPS excludes all dilution and has been computed using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS reflects the
potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. The Company has no
dilutive potential common shares.

Retirement Plans

The Company maintains a 401(k) qualified retirement plan covering eligible
employees under which participants may contribute up to 25% of their
compensation subject to maximum allowable contributions. The Company is
obligated to contribute, on a matching basis, 50% of the first 6% of
compensation voluntarily contributed by participants. The Company may also make
additional contributions to the plan if it so elects.


                                                                          Page 9

NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Retirement Plans (Continued)

In 1991, the Company adopted a nonqualified supplemental retirement benefits
plan for key management employees. Benefits payable under the plan are based
upon the participant's average compensation during his last five years of
employment and are reduced by benefits payable under the Company's qualified
retirement plan and by one-half of the participant's social security benefits.
Benefits under the plan do not vest until the attainment of normal retirement
age; however, a reduced benefit is payable if employment terminates prior to
normal retirement age because of death or disability. The vested portion of the
benefits under this plan amounted to approximately $1,406,000 and $1,345,000 at
October 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company has no obligation to fund
this supplemental plan.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of the Company's significant financial instruments, none of
which are held for trading purposes, approximate fair value at October 31, 2002
and 2001. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash approximate fair value
because of the short maturities of these instruments. Long-term debt
approximates fair value because of its floating interest rate terms. Derivative
financial instruments are carried at fair value.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.


NOTE C - RESTRICTED CASH

The Company has restricted, interest-bearing cash accounts held by the lender
under the escrow provisions of the term loan agreement described in Note E. The
restricted cash balances are held for the following purposes at October 31, 2002
and 2001:

NOTE C - RESTRICTED CASH (CONTINUED)

All rents and other income from operation of the Company's property are
deposited directly into a lockbox account controlled by the lender under the
Company's cash management agreement. In May and November of each year during the
term of the loan, the lender will disburse to the Company amounts in the cash
management account in excess of the amounts needed to replenish the various
escrow accounts.

The Company has granted the lender a security interest in each of the restricted
cash accounts as additional security for the outstanding term loan.

expiration in January 2004. Under the agreement, the Company was to receive an
amount equal to the interest it incurred on its term debt in excess of 8%, if
any. The $265,887 decrease in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement
was charged to earnings as financing expense during the year ended October 31,
2001. In 2002, the Company paid $26,613 to terminate this agreement. The $26,613

interest rate cap agreement that has a notional amount of $130,555,335 at
October 31, 2002. The notional amount will decrease as principal payments are
made on the Company's term debt and will be equal to the term debt until the
agreement expires December 6, 2005. Under the agreement, the Company will
receive an amount equal to the LIBOR rate in excess of 8%, if any. The Company
has designated this interest rate cap agreement as a cash flow hedge of interest
payments once the LIBOR rate exceeds 8%. Since the LIBOR rate remained below 8%
during the year ended October 31, 2002, the cap agreement was not yet in effect;
therefore, the $683,364 decrease in the fair value of the interest rate cap
agreement was charged to earnings during the year ended October 31, 2002 as a
part of financing expense.

The Company also entered into an interest rate floor agreement during the year
ended October 31, 2002. In connection with the execution of the floor agreement,
the Company received $833,000. The notional amount of the floor was $130,555,335
at October 31, 2002. The notional amount will decrease as principal payments are
made on the Company's term debt and will be equal to the term debt until the
agreement expires January 6, 2006. Under the agreement, the Company will pay an
amount equal to the excess of 2.63% over the LIBOR rate, if any. Since the LIBOR
rate decreased below the floor of 2.63% during the year ended October 31, 2002,
the initial $833,000 has been reflected in earnings as a part of financing
expense, and the change in fair value of the interest rate floor agreement has
been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, for the
year ended October 31, 2002.

Total interest cost incurred for the years ended October 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000
was $6,134,336, $8,241,933 and $4,303,766, respectively. Of the interest cost
for the years ended October 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, $4,293, $371,546 and
$194,277, respectively, was capitalized as part of the building construction
costs.

During the year ended October 31, 2001, the Company recorded an extraordinary
loss of $1,886,426 after income taxes as a result of the early extinguishment of
term debt in the amount of $54,039,689. The loss consisted primarily of costs
associated with the early extinguishment and the write-off of unamortized
financing costs of $382,846. The extinguishment of the debt was financed with a
portion of the proceeds from the $135,000,000 term loan.

NOTE G - LAND LEASE COMMITMENT

During 1975, the Company completed construction of an eleven-story exhibition
building. The building is constructed on land leased from the City of High
Point, North Carolina under a noncancelable lease. The lease is for an initial
term of fifty years with three options to renew for periods of ten years each
and a final renewal option for nineteen years. Annual rental under the lease is
$152,234 as of October 31, 2002 and is subject to adjustment at the end of each
five-year period, such adjustment being computed as defined in the lease
agreement. As part of the lease agreement, the Company constructed a theater
complex for public use and office space for use by the City of High Point on the
lower levels of the building. Annual rental cash payments over the initial
fifty-year lease term are being reduced by $39,121 which represents amortization
of the cost of the theater and office complex constructed for the City of High
Point. At the termination of the lease, the building becomes the property of the
City of High Point. Under the terms of the lease, the Company is responsible for
all expenses applicable to the exhibition portion of the building. The City of
High Point is responsible for all expenses applicable to the theater complex and
office space constructed for use by the City.


NOTE H - RETIREMENT EXPENSE

Amounts expensed under the Company's retirement plans amounted to $790,130,
$350,669 and $394,166 for the years ended October 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, including $601,252, $179,200 and $240,796 under the supplemental
retirement benefits plan for the years ended October 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

NOTE H - RETIREMENT EXPENSE (CONTINUED)

During 2002, the Company accelerated the normal retirement date for one of its
key employees covered under the nonqualified supplemental retirement plan
resulting in a substantial increase in expense for the year.


NOTE I - RENTALS UNDER OPERATING LEASES

The Company's leasing operations consist principally of leasing exhibition
space. Property on operating leases consists of substantially all of the asset
"buildings, exclusive of theater complex" included on the consolidated balance
sheets. Accumulated depreciation on this property amounted to $45,154,925 at
October 31, 2002 and $42,925,163 at October 31, 2001. Leases are typically for
five-year periods and contain provisions to escalate rentals based upon either
the increase in the consumer price index or increases in ad valorem taxes,
utility rates and charges, minimum wage imposed by federal and state
governments, maintenance contracts for elevators and air conditioning,
maintenance of common areas, social security payments, increases resulting from
collective bargaining contracts, if any, and such other similar charges and
rates required in operating the Company. Tenants normally renew their leases.

The following is a schedule of minimum future rentals under noncancelable
operating leases as of October 31, 2002, exclusive of amounts due under
escalation provisions of lease agreements:

</TABLE>

Rental income includes contingent rentals under escalation provisions of leases
of $1,380,026, $1,164,693 and $823,536 for the years ended October 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively. Rental income from related parties amounted to
$647,926, $2,682,719 and $2,374,813 for the years ended October 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively.


NOTE J - CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of cash deposits in excess of federally insured
limits and trade accounts receivable from customers predominantly in the Home
Furnishings Industry. As of October 31, 2002, the Company's bank balances
exceeded federally insured limits by $15,861,894. The Company's trade accounts
receivable are generally collateralized by merchandise in leased exhibition
spaces which is in the Company's possession.

NOTE K - STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT

The stockholders' deficit resulted from the payment of dividends substantially
in excess of accumulated earnings. The dividends in excess of accumulated
earnings were financed, in part, with the proceeds of long-term debt. Although
interest on this debt will negatively impact future earnings, management
believes, based on projections of future operations and cash flows, that future
earnings will provide adequate equity capital for the Company and that operating
cash flows will be sufficient to provide for debt service and for the Company's
other financing and investing needs.


NOTE L - CONSTRUCTION COMMITMENTS

At October 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding commitments for building
improvements of approximately $419,000.

                         Report of Independent Auditors


Board of Directors and Members
LRG Furniture, LLC


We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of LRG Furniture, LLC (a Virginia
limited liability company) as of November 30, 2002, and the related statement of
operations, changes in members' deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audit. The financial statements of LRG Furniture, LLC as of and for the
year ended November 30, 2001 were audited by other auditors who have ceased
operations and whose report dated December 21, 2001, expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements before the revision described in Note 3.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of LRG Furniture, LLC as of
November 30, 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.

As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, effective December 1, 2001,
the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("FAS 142").

As discussed above, the financial statements of LRG Furniture, LLC as of
November 30, 2001 and for the year then ended were audited by other auditors who
have ceased operations. As described in Note 3, these financial statements have
been revised to include the transitional disclosures of FAS 142. We applied
procedures with respect to the disclosures in Note 3 pertaining to 2001
financial statement revisions. In our opinion, the FAS 142 disclosures for 2001
in Note 3 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or
apply any procedures to the 2001 financial statements of the Company other than
with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion
or any other form of assurance on the 2001 financial statements taken as a
whole.

The following report is a copy of a report previously issued by Arthur Andersen

Goodwill and Intangible Assets note, the corporation has presented the
transitional disclosures for 2001 required by SFAS No. 142. The Arthur Andersen

statements. The adjustments to the 2001 consolidated financial statements were
reported on by Ernst & Young LLP as stated in their report appearing herein.

financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted

supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of LRG Furniture, LLC as of

                           November 30, 2002 and 2001




1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS

LRG Furniture, LLC (the "Company") was formed as a limited liability company
under the laws of Virginia on November 29, 1999. The Company was formed as a
joint venture between Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc. ("Bassett") and Bassett
Direct Plus Texas, LLC ("BDPT") (collectively referred to herein as the
"Members"). Bassett and BDPT were credited with 51% and 49%, respectively, of
the combined members' equity of $2,677,489 at the date of formation.

The Company currently operates eight retail furniture stores in Texas and
Nevada. These stores operate under the "Bassett Furniture Direct" name and
substantially all of their purchases are contractually obligated from Bassett
and its affiliates.

2. CONTINUING OPERATIONS

The Company has experienced significant losses from operations since inception.
The Company incurred a net loss of $1,980,000 and $6,748,000 in the years 2002
and 2001, respectively, and has Members' deficit of $12,861,000 and $13,655,000
as of November 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Management has implemented a
profit improvement program that includes evaluation and realignment of the
Company's business to improve profitability. This program has resulted in
significant operational changes, overall downsizing of the Company's
administrative and operating overhead and disposals of selected stores (see Note
10). These store disposals have left the Company with eight stores in the Texas
and Nevada markets. As a result of these actions, the Company expects to
substantially reduce losses from operations, however, there can be no assurances
that management's program will be successful.

The Members have historically provided, and are currently providing, sufficient
financial support to the Company to fund the Company's obligations and working
capital requirements as those obligations become due. The Members loaned a total
of $4,100,000 to the Company in 2001. Management of Bassett has committed to
provide the necessary level of financial support to the Company to enable it to
pay its obligations as they become due through November 30, 2003. In addition,
Bassett has guaranteed repayment of all of the Company's third-party long-term
debt.


                                                                               6

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

For comparative purposes, certain amounts in the 2001 financial statements have
been reclassified to conform with the 2002 presentation.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash includes cash on hand, cash in banks and deposits in-transit from credit
card companies.

REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company recognizes revenue upon the delivery of products to its customers.
There is no concentration of credit risk to any one customer. Allowances are
provided for estimated losses associated with anticipated future returns of
products sold by the Company and inability of customers to pay balances due.
Actual product returns and cash collections could differ from management's
estimates making it reasonably possible that a change in these estimates could
occur in the near term.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO)
cost or market. Allowances are established to reduce the cost of excess and
obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value. Shipping and
handling costs associated with inbound freight are included in cost of sales and
amounts related to merchandise inventory on hand at year-end are capitalized in
merchandise inventories.


                                                                               7

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided using the
straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

<TABLE>
<S>                                                       <C>
       Computer equipment                                     3-5 years
       Store fixtures                                           7 years
       Office furniture, fixtures and equipment                 7 years
       Leasehold improvements                             Life of lease
       Vehicles                                                 5 years
</TABLE>

When property is sold or retired, the cost and accumulated depreciation are
removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in the
statement of operations and changes in members' equity. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.

OTHER ASSETS

Other assets were comprised primarily of an assumed lease contract with an
independent third party with terms that were favorable to its local market value
and refundable deposits with various utilities and property lessors. The
favorable lease contract had a gross balance of $758,867 amortized over the
lease term, which was 15 years. Accumulated amortization related to this
favorable lease contract was $107,136 in 2001. These deposits were refundable at
the discretion of the utility or lessor as applicable. This lease contract was
sold during 2002 as part of the stores that were sold to Bassett (see Note 10).

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of," which requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangible assets to be held and used or disposed of by an entity be reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the event assets are
impaired, losses are recognized based on the excess carrying amounts over the
estimated discounted future cash flows or fair market value of the asset. SFAS
No. 121 also requires that assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of
the carrying amount or the fair market value less selling costs. Management does
not believe there are any impairments of long-lived assets at November 30, 2002.


                                                                               8

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)




3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

PREOPENING EXPENSES

Preopening expenses, which consist primarily of payroll and occupancy costs, are
expensed as incurred. Preopening expenses were $193,000 and $177,000 in 2002 and
2001, respectively.

ADVERTISING COSTS

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense was
$3,152,000 and $4,355,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AND COSTS

The Company includes shipping and handling fees billed to customers in net
sales. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight are included
in operating and general expenses and totaled $4,207,000 and $6,442,000 in
fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively.

CUSTOMER DEPOSITS

Customer deposits relate to amounts paid by customers to the Company at the time
they order goods. These deposits are applied to the ultimate sales price once
goods are delivered to the customer, and are recognized as revenue at that time.

INCOME TAXES

The Company is treated as a pass-through entity for federal income tax purposes.
As a result, the Company is not subject to income tax, but rather the liability
for income taxes from the taxable income generated by the Company is the
obligation of the Members. The Company is treated similarly for state income tax
purposes and, under current law in the states in which the Company is conducting
business, the Company is not subject to state income taxes. Accordingly, no
provision or benefit for federal and state income taxes has been recorded in the
accompanying financial statements.


                                                                               9

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)




3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company's financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and long-term debt. Because of their short maturity, the carrying
amounts of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair
value. The carrying amounts of long-term debt approximate fair value due to the
variable rate nature of bank debt and the Company's belief that its interest
rates on fixed interest rate debt due to its Members approximate fair value
rates for the Company.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In April 2001, the Company adopted Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing Financial Assets and
Extinguishment of Liabilities. This statement replaces SFAS No. 125, Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities, but carries over most of the provisions of SFAS No. 125 without
reconsideration. The impact of adopting this pronouncement was not material to
the Company's financial statements.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No.
141, Business Combinations. This statement requires that all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, be accounted for by the purchase
method, eliminating the availability of the pooling-of-interests method. In
addition SFAS No. 141 requires recognition of intangible assets apart from
goodwill if they meet certain criteria. Any acquisition activity performed by
the Company subsequent to the effective date of this statement will be accounted
for under the purchase method. The impact of adopting this pronouncement was not
material to the Company's financial statements.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. This statement supercedes Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion
No. 17, Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142 establishes new standards for measuring
the carrying value of goodwill related to acquired companies. Instead of
amortizing goodwill over a fixed period of time, the Company will instead
measure the fair value of acquiring businesses annually to determine if goodwill
has been impaired. The Company adopted this statement in fiscal 2002. The
Company did not hold any intangible assets during fiscal 2002, thus, the impact
of adopting this pronouncement was not material to the Company's financial
statements.


                                                                              10

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (CONTINUED)

The following table adjusts the reported net income for the year ended November
30, 2001 to exclude amortization of goodwill:

</TABLE>


In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. This statement supercedes SFAS No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed of. In addition, this statement addresses the accounting for the
segment of a business accounted for as a discontinued operation under APB
Opinion 30, Reporting the Results of Operations--Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently
Occurring Events and Transactions. This statement would impact the Company's
reporting if the Company chose to discontinue an operation, and becomes
effective for the Company in fiscal 2003. Management does not expect the impact
of adopting SFAS No. 144 to be material to the Company's financial statements.

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Obligations Associated with Disposal
Activities, which is effective for disposal activities initiated after December
31, 2002. SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a disposal obligation should be
recognized and measured at its fair value when it is incurred. Adoption of the
pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's
financial statements.


                                                                              11

At various dates from March 16, 2000, to August 15, 2000, the Company entered
into a total of eight unsecured notes with a bank for $606,000 each for a total
of $4,848,000. Each note has deferred principal payments of $22,444 beginning 9
months from the close of each note and continuing for 27 months thereafter. The
proceeds of these notes were used primarily to pay for new store opening
inventory. Bassett took over four of these notes during fiscal 2002 in
connection with the sale to Bassett of the associated North Carolina and
Virginia stores. The balance due on the remaining four notes at November 30,
2002 is $583,592. The balance that was due on the eight notes at November 30,
2001 was $3,142,256. Repayment of these loans is guaranteed by Bassett.

On June 4, 2001, the Company entered into an unsecured note with a different
bank for $500,000. The note has deferred principal payments of $16,667 beginning
6 months from the close of the note and continuing for 29 months thereafter. The
proceeds of this note were used primarily to pay for new store opening
inventory. The balance due on this note at November 30, 2002 and 2001 was
$300,000 and $500,000, respectively. Repayment of this loan is guaranteed by
Bassett.

In connection with the acquisition of a Louisville store in 2000 (which was
subsequently sold in 2001, as further discussed in Note 10), the Company assumed
a $252,500 unsecured note payable. The note required monthly principal payments
of $18,704 through June 30, 2002. The balance due on this note at November 30,
2001, was $130,924. Repayment of this note was guaranteed by Bassett. During the
acquisition of this store, the Company had also assumed an unsecured demand note
due to Bassett of $566,815, which was outstanding at November 30, 2001. The
store was sold in December 2001 and both of these notes were settled in
connection with the sale.

4. LONG-TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE TO MEMBERS (CONTINUED)

On June 1, 2000, August 1, 2000, and May 1, 2001, the Company entered into three
unsecured notes with Bassett for $1,000,000, $5,000,000 and $3,500,000,
respectively. All of these notes had the same terms with deferred principal and
interest payments, all payable November 1, 2004. These Notes were refinanced
with Bassett in March 2002 to three unsecured notes for $3,100,000, $3,000,000,
and $4,250,000 with the same terms and deferred principal and interest
payments, all payable November 30, 2007 (see Note 10).

On November 30, 2001 and 2000, the Company entered into unsecured notes with
BDPT for $600,000 and $1,808,000, respectively. These unsecured notes contain
various restrictive covenants which include, among others, limitations on loans
and contingent liabilities except in the normal course of business. As of
November 30, 2002, the Company was in compliance with all of these covenants.

5. LEASE COMMITMENTS

The Company's administrative offices and retail locations are leased under
noncancelable operating lease agreements that expire from 2003 to 2016. Most of
these leases contain renewal options of 3 to 35 years. Certain of the lease
agreements for retail locations require the payment of contingent rentals based
on a percentage of sales above stipulated levels. No contingent rental expense
was incurred during 2002 or 2001. Certain of the lease agreements contain rent
escalation clauses that are not significant. Total rent expense for 2002 and
2001 was $4,243,000 and $6,242,000, respectively. Rent expense related to
locations owned or leased from the Members was $2,915,000 in 2002 and $3,952,000
in 2001.

6. OTHER RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Substantially all purchases of merchandise inventories are made from Bassett and
its affiliates. These related entities sell products to the Company at prices
and terms equal to their normal selling prices and terms to unrelated entities.
Accounts payable due to these related parties was $3,895,118 and $9,230,000 in
2002 and 2001, respectively.

Interest expense on borrowings from related parties as described in Note 4 was
$723,132 in 2002 and $789,000 in 2001. Portions of these amounts are included in
notes payable to Members and deferred interest payable in the accompanying
balance sheets at November 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The Company paid salaries to principals of the Members for administrative and
executive services in the amount of $300,000 in both 2002 and 2001.

7. BENEFIT PLAN

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN

The Company maintains a qualified 401(k) employee savings plan covering
substantially all full-time employees. Under the plan, employees may elect to
contribute up to 15% of their compensation annually. Under the plan, the Company
is not required to make contributions to the plan and no contributions were made
in 2002 or 2001.

                                                                              15

8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

The Company has certain obligations under various employment agreements through
November 30, 2004, that stipulate, among other things, certain levels of
compensation, bonus potential, other miscellaneous benefits and severance
arrangements. Potential contingent liabilities under these arrangements
approximate $450,000.

LITIGATION

The Company is involved in various legal proceedings encountered in the normal
course of business. In the opinion of management, based on the factors presently
known, the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company's financial position or future results of operations.

9. MEMBERS' DEFICIT

The Members' deficit account in the accompanying balance sheets reflects the
initial capital contributed by the Members of $2,677,489 and all losses of the
Company since inception. No distributions have been made to the Members since
inception. During 2002, Bassett contributed $2,774,000 to Members' deficit
consisting of $2,589,000 of debt and related interest of $185,000. The benefits
of this contribution were allocated proportionately to the Members based on the
Members' relative ownership interests in the Company. Under the terms of the
Limited Liability Company Agreement (the LLC Agreement), profits and losses and
any distributions of the Company are allocated to its members based upon the
Members' relative ownership interests in the Company and are made at the sole
discretion of the Board of Managers. Members may not assign or transfer their
rights without consent of the other Member. Both Members have two positions each
in the Board of Directors. There is a single class of Members with the same
rights, powers, duties, obligations, preferences and privileges. Each Member's
liability is limited to the sum of its capital contributions, its share of any
undistributed assets of the Company and any amounts previously distributed to it
from the Company.

The Company's operating agreement provides an option for BDPT to put its
ownership interest to Bassett at a specified formula during fiscal year 2007 and
2010, and conversely, providing a call option for Bassett to purchase BDPT's
interest in the Company at a separate formula during fiscal years 2008 through
2010.

As stated in the Articles of Organization, the latest date on which the Company
is to dissolve is November 30, 2019.

                                                                              16

10. SALES AND CLOSURE OF RETAIL STORES

The Company sold its retail furniture store in Knoxville, Tennessee, in January
2001 to an unrelated third party. Substantially all of the inventory in that
location had been sold through a liquidation sale that began in September 2000.
The lease for this location has been assumed by an unrelated third party, who
will utilize the store as a "Bassett Furniture Direct" store going forward.
Losses due to this transaction were insignificant.

The Company closed its retail furniture store in Fredericksburg, Virginia, in
March 2001. Substantially all of the inventory in that location was liquidated
by May 2001. The lease for this location was terminated by Bassett, the owner of
the property, concurrent with the closure of the store. Losses due to the
closure of this store were insignificant.

The Company sold its retail furniture store in Hickory, North Carolina, to
Bassett in July 2001. The principal terms of the agreement called for inventory
and property to be sold at net book value to Bassett. Additionally, Bassett
assumed the customer deposit liability and the lease of the retail facility in
Hickory. There was no gain or loss associated with this transaction.

The Company sold its retail furniture store in Greenville, South Carolina, to an
unrelated third party, in August 2001. The transaction involved the sale of
inventory, property, equipment and leasehold improvements. The buyer also
assumed the customer deposit liability and the future lease commitments for the
store. The Company incurred a loss of approximately $140,000 primarily related
to the disposal of property and equipment.

On December 15, 2000, the Company acquired the assets and assumed the
liabilities of a third-party Bassett Furniture Direct licensee in Louisville,
Kentucky, in a noncash transaction. The fair value of liabilities assumed
exceeded the fair value of assets acquired by $367,569, which was recorded as an
intangible asset. The intangible asset, which related primarily to acquired
order book and customer lists, was amortized as operating and general expenses
during 2001. As part of the transaction, Bassett purchased the related building
and was leasing it to the Company on a month-to-month basis. This store was sold
in December 2001 to an unrelated local furniture retailer. The purchaser bought
substantially all assets and assumed all liabilities of the store. Related
losses on this transaction were not significant.

10. SALES AND CLOSURE OF RETAIL STORES (CONTINUED)

In March 2002, the Company and Bassett entered into an agreement to streamline
the operations of the Company. The agreement called for Bassett to refinance
debt due by the Company to Bassett. Also, as part of the agreement, the Company
sold five stores in North Carolina and Virginia to Bassett for the net book
value as of the effective date of the agreement of approximately $188,000
($5,405,000 of assets and $5,217,000 of liabilities) including bank debt of
approximately $1,481,000.

Sales related to all stores sold, closed or planned to be sold included in the
statement of operations and changes in Members' deficit for the years ended
November 30, 2002 and 2001, were $5,162,883 and $27,944,000, respectively and
related loss from operations for the years ended November 30, 2002 and 2001 were
$533,908 and $4,892,000, respectively.

During September 2002, the Company opened a new store in southwest Houston.
Subsequent to year-end, in December 2002, the Company opened a new store in
southeast Houston.
