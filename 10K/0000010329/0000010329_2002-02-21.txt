ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
         (dollar amounts in thousands except per share data)

         GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

         Bassett Furniture Industries, Incorporated (the "Company") was
         incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1930.
         The executive offices are located in Bassett, Virginia.

         Material Changes in the Development of Business in the last five years
         are as follows:

         There have been two significant business developments that have
         materially affected the Company's operations over the last five years.
         First, the Company has created and re-channeled sales through a
         vertically integrated retail sales network. This strategy both builds
         on the Company's strengths (brand name, balance sheet, product
         offerings) and better positions the Company to capitalize on the
         changing furniture retail environment. The independently owned licensee
         stores, known as Bassett Furniture Direct, accounted for 36% of the
         Company's sales in 2001. There were 68 stores operating at November 24,
         2001. Second, the Company has restructured production capacities and
         eliminated costs to closely align manufacturing capabilities with the
         Company's target markets. These efforts have resulted in the
         elimination of approximately 4,000 salaried and hourly positions over
         the last five years.

         The Company restructured production capacities for its Wood Division in
         2001. During the first quarter, production was moved from one facility
         to another and a wood manufacturing facility was identified for closure
         and was subsequently closed in the second quarter. Additionally, 60
         corporate office positions were eliminated in the first and second
         quarters of 2001. Ongoing efforts to match production with demand,
         offer more competitively priced products and operate more efficient
         manufacturing facilities resulted in the announcement and subsequent
         closure of two additional facilities in Bassett, Virginia during the
         third quarter of 2001. Production has been moved to other manufacturing
         facilities in Virginia or has been outsourced. Approximately 800
         positions were eliminated as a result of this restructuring activity.
         Restructuring charges of $6,952 were recognized in 2001. The Company
         also recorded unusual and non-recurring charges of $1,051 for inventory
         losses related to discontinued product. This amount is included in 2001
         cost of sales.

         The Company made a decision in late 2000 to consolidate production in
         its Wood Division. This included transferring certain products to
         different facilities, reducing one facility to rough-end operations
         only, and eliminating approximately 300 salaried and hourly positions.
         As a result, the Company recorded a restructuring charge in 2000 of
         $6,680, of which, $5,800 related to the write-down of property and
         equipment and $880 related to severance and related employee benefits
         costs.

         Early in fiscal year 2000, the Company merged all of its eight
         Company-owned Bassett Furniture Direct (BFD) stores with a licensee's
         five BFD stores to form a joint venture known as the LRG Furniture, LLC
         ("LRG"). Refer to Note G of the Consolidated Financial Statements
         included in the Annual Report for more information about the joint
         venture.

         During 1999 the Company expanded its BFD retail store concept by adding
         five corporate owned stores to its existing network of licensee
         operated stores. Additionally, the Company took over operations of two
         financially troubled BFD stores operated by licensees.

         During 1999, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of its
         Bedding Division to Premier Bedding Group LLC ("PBG"). The net assets
         sold, which totaled $8,400, were exchanged for $6,500 in cash and a
         $1,900 convertible note receivable. Refer to Note B of the Consolidated
         Financial Statements included in the Annual Report for more information
         about the bedding sale.

         During 1997, the Company commenced the restructuring of certain of its
         operations and recorded restructuring and impaired asset charges of
         $20,646. The restructuring plan was the result of management's decision
         to focus on its core Bassett product line and efforts to improve
         operating

                                                                          PAGE 3

         efficiencies. The principal actions of the plan included the closure or
         sale of fourteen manufacturing facilities, elimination of three product
         lines (National/Mt. Airy, Impact and veneer production) and the
         severance of approximately 1,000 employees.

         Refer to Note N of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
         the Annual Report for a detail of restructuring activity and refer to
         the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of the Annual Report
         for additional discussion on these topics.

         OPERATING SEGMENTS

         The Company's primary business is in wholesale home furnishings. The
         wholesale home furnishings business is involved principally in the
         manufacture, sale and distribution of furniture products to a network
         of independently owned stores and stores owned by an affiliate of the
         Company. The wholesale business consists primarily of three operating
         segments: wood, upholstery and import.

         Refer to Note R of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
         the Annual Report for more information about segment information for
         1999, 2000 and 2001 and refer to the Management's Discussion and
         Analysis section of the Annual Report for additional discussion on this
         topic.

         DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
         The Company is a manufacturer of quality home furnishings and sells a
         full range of furniture products and accessories through department and
         furniture stores and an exclusive network of retail stores, some of
         which are owned by an affiliate while others are independently-owned.
         Retail stores are located throughout the United States. The Company has
         ten manufacturing facilities throughout the United States.

         The wood segment is engaged in the manufacture and sale of wood
         furniture, including bedroom and dining suites and accent pieces, to
         independent retailers and a retailer, which is an affiliate of the
         Company. The wood segment accounted for 57%, 62% and 66% of total net
         sales during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company currently
         has six wood manufacturing facilities. The upholstery segment is
         involved in the manufacture and sale of upholstered frames and cut
         upholstery items having a variety of frame and fabric options,
         including sofas, chairs, and love seats. The Company currently has
         three upholstery manufacturing facilities. The upholstery segment
         accounted for 29%, 27% and 26% of total net sales during 2001, 2000 and
         1999, respectively. The import segment sources product, principally
         from Asia, and sells this product to independent and affiliated
         retailers. The import segment accounted for 11%, 8% and 5% of total net
         sales during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

         Raw materials used by the Company are generally available from numerous
         sources and are obtained principally from domestic sources. The Company
         has also sought to source component parts from overseas markets when it
         is economically advantageous. The Company currently assembles and
         finishes these imported components in several of its plants in the
         United States.

         The Company's trademarks , including "Bassett" and the names of its
         marketing divisions, products and collections are significant to the
         conduct of its business. This importance is due to consumer recognition
         of the names and identification with the Company's broad range of
         products. Certain of the Company's trademarks are licensed to
         independent retailers for use in full store presentations and in store
         gallery presentations of the Company's products. The Company also owns
         certain patents and licenses that are important in the conduct of the
         Company's business.

         The furniture industry in which the Company competes is not considered
         to be a seasonal industry. However, working capital levels will
         fluctuate based on overall business conditions, and desired service
         levels.

         Sales to one customer (JC Penney Company) amounted to approximately 15%
         of gross sales in 2001, 16% and 16% of gross sales in 2000 and 1999,
         respectively. Additionally, sales to LRG, an affiliate of the Company,
         were 10% of total sales in 2001 and 7% of total sales in 2000. The
         Company's backlog of orders believed to be firm was at $19,000 at
         November 24, 2001 and


<PAGE>

                                                                          PAGE 4

         $22,000 at November 25, 2000. It is expected that the November 24, 2001
         backlog will be filled within the 2002 fiscal year.

         The furniture industry is very competitive and there are a large number
         of manufacturers both within the United States and offshore who compete
         in the market on the basis of product quality, price, style, delivery
         and service. Additionally, certain retailers are increasingly sourcing
         imported product directly, thus bypassing domestic furniture
         manufacturers. Based on annual sales revenue, the Company is one of the
         largest furniture manufacturers located in the United States. The
         Company has been successful in this competitive environment because its
         products represent excellent value combining attractive prices, quality
         and styling; prompt delivery; and courteous service.

         The furniture industry is considered to be a "fashion" industry subject
         to constant fluctuations to meet changing consumer preferences and
         tastes. As such, the Company is continuously involved in the
         development of new designs and products. Due to the nature of these
         efforts and the close relationship to the manufacturing operations,
         these costs are considered normal operating costs and are not
         segregated. The Company is not otherwise involved in "traditional"
         research and development activities nor does the Company sponsor
         research and development activities of any of its customers.

         In management's view, the Company has complied in all material respects
         with all federal, state and local standards in the area of safety,
         health and pollution and environmental controls. Compliance with these
         standards did result in a charge to earnings in 1997 and capital
         spending in 1998 and 1999, but otherwise, has not had a material
         adverse effect on past earnings or competitive position. The Company is
         involved in environmental matters at certain of its plant facilities,
         which arise in the normal course of business. Although the final
         outcome of these environmental matters cannot be determined, based on
         the facts presently known, it is management's opinion that the final
         resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on
         the Company's financial position or future results of operations.

         The Company had approximately 2,900 employees at November 24, 2001.

         The Company has several investments in affiliated companies, including
         a minority interest in International Home Furnishings Center, Inc.
         (IHFC) which is a lessor of permanent exhibition space to furniture and
         accessory manufacturers. The IHFC financial statements are included on
         pages F-1 to F-15. The Company owns a majority interest in The Bassett
         Industries Alternative Asset Fund, LP, which invests in a variety of
         other private partnerships, employing a combination of investment
         strategies. The Bassett Industries Alternative Asset Fund's year ended
         on December 31, 2001, as such its financial statements have not been
         included in this Form 10-K. Form 10-K will be amended to include such
         statements when available. The Company owns a majority interest in LRG
         Furniture, LLC, (LRG), which is a retailer of home furnishings. The LRG
         financial statements are included on pages F-16 to F-28.

         FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES

         The Company has no foreign operations, and its export sales were
         approximately $3.2 million, $4.9 million, and $10.6 million in 2001,
         2000, and 1999 respectively.

         capacity for the Company's manufacturing needs.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         Legislation has phased out interest deductions on certain policy loans
         related to Company owned life insurance (COLI) as of January 1, 1999.
         The Company has recorded cumulative reductions to income tax expense of
         approximately $8,000 as the result of COLI interest deductions through
         1998. The Internal Revenue Service, on a national level, has pursued an
         adverse position regarding the deductibility of COLI policy loan
         interest for years prior to January 1, 1999. The IRS has received
         favorable rulings on the non-deductibility of COLI loan interest.
         Management understands that these rulings and the adverse position
         taken by the IRS will be subjected to extensive challenges in court. In
         the event that the IRS prevails, the outcome should not be material to
         the Company's future results of operations.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



To the Board of Directors
International Home Furnishings Center, Inc.
High Point, North Carolina


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of International
Home Furnishings Center, Inc. and subsidiary as of October 31, 2001 and 2000 and
the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity (deficit),
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2001.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of International Home
Furnishings Center, Inc. and subsidiary at October 31, 2001 and 2000 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended October 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

INTERNATIONAL HOME FURNISHINGS CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER 31, 2001, 2000 AND 1999


NOTE A - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

The Company is the lessor of permanent exhibition space to furniture and
accessory manufacturers which are headquartered throughout the United States and
in many foreign countries. This exhibition space, located in High Point, North
Carolina, is used by the Home Furnishings Industry to showcase its products at
the International Home Furnishings Market held each April and October. The
details of the operating leases with the Company's tenants are described in Note
I.

The Company has been in business since June 27, 1919, and operates under the
trade name of "International Home Furnishings Center."


NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies relative to the carrying values of property and
equipment, theater complex and interest rate cap agreement are indicated in the
captions on the consolidated balance sheets. Other significant accounting
policies are as follows:

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of International Home
Furnishings Center, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, IHFC Properties,
L.L.C., a company organized on December 21, 2000. All material intercompany
transactions have been eliminated. The Company and its subsidiary are referred
to collectively herein as "the Company." Notwithstanding the consolidation of
the Company and IHFC Properties, L.L.C. in these financial statements, IHFC
Properties, L.L.C. is a separate entity, with separate assets and liabilities
and has its own separate financial statements.

Rental Income

Income from rental of exhibition space is recognized under the operating method.
Aggregate rentals are reported as income on the straight-line basis over the
lives of the leases, and expenses are charged as incurred against such income.
Future rentals under existing leases are not recorded as assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Investment Securities

The Company has investments in debt and marketable equity securities. Debt
securities consist of obligations of state and local governments and U. S.
corporations. Marketable equity securities consist primarily of investments in
mutual funds.

                                                                         Page 7

                                                                             F-8

NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Investment Securities (Continued)

Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the date
individual investment securities are acquired, and the appropriateness of such
classification is reassessed at each balance sheet date. Since the Company
neither buys investment securities in anticipation of short-term fluctuations in
market prices or commits to holding debt securities to their maturities,
investments in debt and marketable equity securities have been classified as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, and
unrealized holding gains and losses, if significant, net of the related deferred
tax effect, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. Premiums and discounts on
investments in debt securities are amortized over their contractual lives.
Interest on debt securities is recognized in income as accrued, and dividends on
marketable equity securities are recognized in income when declared. Realized
gains and losses are included in income and are determined on the basis of the
specific securities sold.

Property, Equipment and Depreciation

Expenditures for maintenance, repairs, and minor renewals are charged to expense
as incurred. Major renewals and betterments are capitalized. Depreciation is
provided primarily on the straight-line method over the following estimated
useful lives:

<TABLE>
<S>                                                                                           <C>
              Land improvements                                                                     10 years
              Building structures                                                             20 to 50 years
              Building components                                                              5 to 20 years
              Furniture and equipment                                                          3 to 10 years
</TABLE>

In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of," the Company periodically reviews long-lived assets
when indications of impairment exist, and if the value of the assets is
impaired, an impairment loss would be recognized.

Deferred Financing Costs

Costs associated with obtaining long-term financing have been deferred and are
being amortized on the interest method over the term of the related debt.
Amortization expense charged to operations during the years ended October 31,
2001, 2000 and 1999 was $522,725, $83,530 and $83,530, respectively.

Derivative Instruments

As disclosed in Note E, the Company entered into an interest rate cap agreement
to limit its exposure to increasing interest cost on its term debt. The
Company's investment in the agreement is carried at fair value, and changes in
fair value are included in earnings. The agreement is not designated as a hedge.

                                                                         Page 8

NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Income Taxes

Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the
consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus
deferred taxes related to temporary differences between the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and their tax bases. The deferred tax assets and
liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences,
which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are
recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the
effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

Earnings Per Common Share

The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share," which specifies the computation,
presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings per share ("EPS"). Basic
EPS excludes all dilution and has been computed using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS reflects the
potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. The Company has no
dilutive potential common shares.

Retirement Plans

The Company maintains a 401(k) qualified retirement plan covering eligible
employees under which participants may contribute up to 25% of their
compensation subject to maximum allowable contributions. The Company is
obligated to contribute, on a matching basis, 50% of the first 6% of
compensation voluntarily contributed by participants. The Company may also make
additional contributions to the plan if it so elects.

In 1991, the Company adopted a nonqualified supplemental retirement benefits
plan for key management employees. Benefits payable under the plan are based
upon the participant's average compensation during his last five years of
employment and are reduced by benefits payable under the Company's qualified
retirement plan and by one-half of the participant's social security benefits.
Benefits under the plan do not vest until the attainment of normal retirement
age; however, a reduced benefit is payable if employment terminates prior to
normal retirement age because of death or disability. The vested portion of the
benefits under this plan amounted to approximately $1,345,000 at October 31,
2001. The Company has no obligation to fund this supplemental plan.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of the Company's significant financial instruments, none of
which are held for trading purposes, approximates fair value at October 31, 2001
and 2000. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash approximate fair value
because of the short maturities of these instruments. Long-term debt
approximates fair value because of its floating interest rate terms.

                                                                         Page 9

NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.


NOTE C - RESTRICTED CASH

The Company has restricted, interest-bearing cash accounts held by the lender
under the escrow provisions of the term loan agreement described in Note E. The
restricted cash balances are held for the following purposes at October 31,
2001:

</TABLE>

All rents and other income from operation of the Company's property are
deposited directly into a lockbox account controlled by the lender under the
Company's cash management agreement. In May and November of each year during the
term of the loan, the lender will disburse to the Company amounts in the cash
management account in excess of the amounts needed to replenish the various
escrow accounts.

The Company has granted the lender a security interest in each of the restricted
cash accounts as additional security for the outstanding term loan.

NOTE G - LAND LEASE COMMITMENT

During 1975, the Company completed construction of an eleven-story exhibition
building. The building is constructed on land leased from the City of High
Point, North Carolina under a noncancelable lease. The lease is for an initial
term of fifty years with three options to renew for periods of ten years each
and a final renewal option for nineteen years. Annual rental under the lease is
$152,234 as of October 31, 2001 and is subject to adjustment at the end of each
five-year period, such adjustment being computed as defined in the lease
agreement. As part of the lease agreement, the Company constructed a theater
complex for public use and office space for use by the City of High Point on the
lower levels of the building. Annual rental cash payments over the initial
fifty-year lease term are being reduced by $39,121 which represents amortization
of the cost of the theater and office complex constructed for the City of High
Point. At the termination of the lease, the building becomes the property of the
City of High Point. Under the terms of the lease, the Company is responsible for
all expenses applicable to the exhibition portion of the building. The City of
High Point is responsible for all expenses applicable to the theater complex and
office space constructed for use by the City.


NOTE H - RETIREMENT EXPENSE

Amounts expensed under the Company's retirement plans amounted to $350,669,
$394,166 and $691,698 for the years ended October 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively, including $179,200, $240,796 and $541,136 under the supplemental
retirement benefits plan for the years ended October 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

NOTE I - RENTALS UNDER OPERATING LEASES

The Company's leasing operations consist principally of leasing exhibition
space. Property on operating leases consists of substantially all of the asset
"buildings, exclusive of theater complex" included on the consolidated balance
sheets. Accumulated depreciation on this property amounted to $42,925,163 at
October 31, 2001 and $42,943,916 at October 31, 2000. Leases are typically for
five-year periods and contain provisions to escalate rentals based upon either
the increase in the consumer price index or increases in ad valorem taxes,
utility rates and charges, minimum wage imposed by federal and state
governments, maintenance contracts for elevators and air conditioning,
maintenance of common areas, social security payments, increases resulting from
collective bargaining contracts, if any, and such other similar charges and
rates required in operating the Company. Tenants normally renew their leases.

The following is a schedule of minimum future rentals under noncancelable
operating leases as of October 31, 2001, exclusive of amounts due under
escalation provisions of lease agreements:

</TABLE>

Rental income includes contingent rentals under escalation provisions of leases
of $1,164,693, $823,536 and $1,322,521 for the years ended October 31, 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. Rental income from related parties amounted to
$2,682,719, $2,374,813 and $1,980,775 for the years ended October 31, 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively.


NOTE J - CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of cash deposits in excess of federally insured
limits and trade accounts receivable from customers predominantly in the Home
Furnishings Industry. As of October 31, 2001, the Company's bank balances
exceeded federally insured limits by $16,509,628. The Company's trade accounts
receivable are generally collateralized by merchandise in leased exhibition
spaces which is in the Company's possession.


NOTE K - STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT

The stockholders' deficit resulted from the payment of dividends substantially
in excess of accumulated earnings. The dividends in excess of accumulated
earnings were financed, in part, with the proceeds of long-term debt. Although
interest on this debt will negatively impact future earnings, management
believes, based on projections of future operations and cash flows, that future
earnings will provide adequate equity capital for the Company and that operating
cash flows will be sufficient to provide for debt service and for the Company's
other financing and investing needs.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                           NOVEMBER 30, 2001 AND 2000

 1. HISTORY AND ORGANIZATION

    LRG Furniture, LLC (the Company) was formed as a limited liability company
    under the laws of Virginia on November 29, 1999. The Company was formed as a
    joint venture between Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc. (Bassett) and
    Bassett Direct Plus Texas, LLC (BDPT) (collectively referred to herein as
    the Members). Bassett and BDPT were credited with 51% and 49%, respectively,
    of the combined members' equity of $2,677,489 at the date of formation.

 2. CONTINUING OPERATIONS

    The Company has experienced significant losses from operations since
    inception. The Company incurred a net loss of $6,748,000 and $9,584,000 in
    the years 2001 and 2000, respectively, and has Members' deficit of
    $13,655,000 and $6,907,000 as of November 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
    Management has implemented a profit improvement program that includes
    evaluation and realignment of the Company's business to improve
    profitability. This program has resulted in significant operational changes,
    overall downsizing of the Company's administrative and operating overhead
    and disposals or planned disposals of selected stores (see Note 11). These
    store disposals will leave the Company with seven stores in the Texas and
    Nevada markets. As a result of these actions, the Company expects to
    substantially reduce losses from operations, however, there can be no
    assurances that management's program will be successful.

    The Members have historically provided, and are currently providing,
    sufficient financial support to the Company to fund the Company's
    obligations and working capital requirements as those obligations become
    due. The Members loaned a total of $4,100,000 to the Company in 2001 and
    $7,808,000 in 2000 (see Note 5). Management of Bassett has committed to
    provide the necessary level of financial support to the Company to enable it
    to pay its obligations as they become due through November 30, 2003.
    Bassett, however, is not legally obligated to provide such support. In
    addition, Bassett has guaranteed repayment of all of the Company's
    third-party long-term debt.

 3. OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    OPERATIONS

    The Company currently operates 12 retail furniture stores in North Carolina,
    Virginia, Kentucky, Nevada and Texas (see Note 11). These stores operate
    under the "Bassett Furniture Direct" name and substantially all of their
    purchases are contractually obligated from Bassett and its affiliates.

    USE OF ESTIMATES

    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
    and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
    date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
    expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

                                      -2-

    RECLASSIFICATIONS

    For comparative purposes, certain amounts in the 2000 financial statements
    have been reclassified to conform with the 2001 presentation.

    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

    Cash includes cash on hand, cash in banks and deposits in-transit from
    credit card companies.

    REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

    The Company recognizes revenue upon the delivery of products to its
    customers. There is no concentration of credit risk to any one customer.
    Allowances are provided for estimated losses associated with anticipated
    future returns of products sold by the Company and inability of customers to
    pay balances due. Actual product returns and cash collections could differ
    from management's estimates making it reasonably possible that a change in
    these estimates could occur in the near term.

    MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

    Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out
    (FIFO) cost or market. Allowances are established to reduce the cost of
    excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value.
    Shipping and handling costs associated with inbound freight are included in
    cost of sales and amounts related to merchandise inventory on hand at
    year-end are capitalized in merchandise inventories.

    PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

    Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided using
    the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

<TABLE>
<S>                                                   <C>
Computer equipment                                        3-5 years
Store fixtures                                              7 years
Office furniture, fixtures and equipment                    7 years
Leasehold improvements                                Life of lease
Vehicles                                                    5 years
</TABLE>

    When property is sold or retired, the cost and accumulated depreciation are
    removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in
    the statement of operations and changes in members' equity. Expenditures for
    maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.

    OTHER ASSETS

    Other assets are comprised primarily of an assumed lease contract with an
    independent third party that has terms that are favorable to its local
    market value and refundable deposits with various utilities and property
    lessors. The favorable lease contract, which has a gross balance of
    $758,867, is amortized over the lease term, which is 15 years. Accumulated
    amortization related to this favorable lease contract was $107,136 and
    $53,568 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The deposits are refundable at the
    discretion of the utility or lessor as applicable.

                                      -3-

    LONG-LIVED ASSETS

    The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
    121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
    Assets to be Disposed Of," which requires that long-lived assets and certain
    identifiable intangible assets to be held and used or disposed of by an
    entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
    recoverable. In the event assets are impaired, losses are recognized based
    on the excess carrying amounts over the estimated discounted future cash
    flows or fair market value of the asset. SFAS No. 121 also requires that
    assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
    the fair market value less selling costs. Management does not believe there
    are any impairments of long-lived assets at November 30, 2001.

    PREOPENING EXPENSES

    Preopening expenses, which consist primarily of payroll and occupancy costs,
    are expensed as incurred. Preopening expenses were $177,000 and $450,000 in
    2001 and 2000, respectively.

    ADVERTISING COSTS

    The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense was
    $4,355,000 and $5,931,000 in 2001 and 2000, respectively.

    SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AND COSTS

    In September 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF 00-10,
    "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs" (EITF 00-10). EITF
    00-10 requires shipping and handling fees billed to customers to be
    classified as revenue and shipping and handling costs to be either
    classified as cost of sales or disclosed in the notes to the consolidated
    financial statements. The Company includes shipping and handling fees billed
    to customers in net sales. Shipping and handling costs associated with
    outbound freight are included in operating and general expenses and totaled
    $6,442,000 and $7,012,000 in fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively.

    CUSTOMER DEPOSITS

    Customer deposits relate to amounts paid by customers to the Company at the
    time they order goods. These deposits are applied to the ultimate sales
    price once goods are delivered to the customer, and are recognized as
    revenue at that time.

    INCOME TAXES

    The Company is treated as a pass-through entity for federal income tax
    purposes. As a result, the Company is not subject to income tax, but rather
    the liability for income taxes from the taxable income generated by the
    Company is the obligation of the Members. The Company is treated similarly
    for state income tax purposes and, under current law in the states in which
    the Company is conducting business, the Company is not subject to state
    income taxes. Accordingly, no provision or benefit for federal and state
    income taxes has been recorded in the accompanying financial statements.

    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

    The Company's financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable,
    accounts payable and long-term debt. Because of their short maturity, the
    carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable
    approximate fair value. The carrying amounts of long-term debt approximate
    fair value due to the variable rate nature of bank debt and the Company's
    belief that its interest rates on fixed interest rate debt due to its
    Members approximate fair value rates for the Company.

    RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

    In June 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS
    No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
    Activities." This statement amends the accounting and reporting standards of
    Statement No. 133 for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging
    activities. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for
    derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
    other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives), and for hedging
    activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either
    assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure
    those instruments at fair value. The Company adopted the provisions of this
    statement in 2001 and the impact of adopting the statement is immaterial.

    In April 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers
    and Servicing Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities." This
    statement replaces SFAS No. 125, but carries over most of the provisions of
    SFAS No. 125 without reconsideration. The impact of adopting this
    pronouncement was not material to the Company's financial statements.

    In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." This
    statement requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30,
    2001, be accounted for by the purchase method, eliminating the availability
    of the pooling-of-interests method. In addition SFAS No. 141 requires
    recognition of intangible assets apart from goodwill if they meet certain
    criteria. Any acquisition activity performed by the Company subsequent to
    the effective date of this statement will be accounted for under the
    purchase method. Management does not expect the impact of adopting SFAS No.
    141 to be material to the Company's financial statements.

    In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets." This statement supercedes APB Opinion No. 17. SFAS No. 142
    establishes new standards for measuring the carrying value of goodwill
    related to acquired companies. Instead of amortizing goodwill over a fixed
    period of time, the Company will instead measure the fair value of acquiring
    businesses annually to determine if goodwill has been impaired. The Company
    plans to adopt this statement in fiscal 2002. Amortization of intangibles
    recorded in fiscal 2001 that may no longer be recorded after implementation
    was $367,569 (see Note 4). Management is currently assessing other
    implementation issues and has not yet determined whether, or the extent to
    which, it will affect the financial statements.

    In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment
    of Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." This statement supercedes SFAS No. 121.
    In addition, this statement addresses the accounting for the segment of a
    business accounted for as a discontinued operation under APB Opinion 30.
    This statement would impact the Company's reporting if the Company chose to
    discontinue an operation, and becomes effective for the Company in fiscal
    2003. Management does not expect the impact of adopting SFAS No. 144 to be
    material to the Company's financial statements.

 4. ACQUISITION OF LOUISVILLE STORE

    On December 15, 2000, the Company acquired the assets and assumed the
    liabilities of a third-party Bassett Furniture Direct licensee in
    Louisville, Kentucky, in a noncash transaction. The fair value of
    liabilities assumed (primarily customer deposits and loans payable which are
    discussed further in Note 5) exceeded the fair value of assets acquired
    (primarily inventory and leasehold improvements) by $367,569, which was
    recorded as an intangible asset. The intangible asset, which relates
    primarily to acquired order book and customer lists, was amortized as
    operating and general expenses during 2001. As part of the transaction,
    Bassett purchased the related building and was leasing it to the Company on
    a month-to-month basis. This store was sold subsequent to year-end (see Note
    11).

 5. LONG-TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE TO MEMBERS

    Long-term debt and notes payable to Members at November 30, 2001 and 2000,

    At various dates from March 16, 2000, to August 15, 2000, the Company
    entered into a total of eight unsecured notes with a bank for $606,000 each
    for a total of $4,848,000. Each note has deferred principal payments of
    $22,444 beginning 9 months from the close of each note and continuing for 27
    months thereafter. The proceeds of these notes were used primarily to pay
    for new store opening inventory. The balance due on these notes at November
    30, 2001 and 2000, is $3,142,256 and $4,848,000, respectively. Repayment of
    these loans is guaranteed by Bassett.

    On June 4, 2001, the Company entered into an unsecured note with the same
    bank for $500,000. The note has deferred principal payments of $16,667
    beginning 6 months from the close of the note and continuing for 29 months
    thereafter. The proceeds of this note were used primarily to pay for the new
    store opening inventory. The balance due on this note at November 30, 2001,
    is $500,000. Repayment of this loan is guaranteed by Bassett.

    In connection with the acquisition of the Louisville store as discussed in
    Note 4, the Company assumed a $252,500 unsecured note payable with the same
    bank. The note requires monthly principal payments of $18,704 through June
    30, 2002. The balance due on this note at November 30, 2001, is $130,924.
    Repayment of this note is guaranteed by Bassett.

    On June 1, 2000, August 1, 2000, and May 1, 2001, the Company entered into
    three unsecured notes with Bassett for $1,000,000, $5,000,000 and
    $3,500,000, respectively. All of these notes have the same terms and have
    deferred principal and interest payments, all payable November 1, 2004 (see
    Note 11).

    In connection with the acquisition of the Louisville store as discussed in
    Note 4, the Company assumed an unsecured demand note due to Bassett of
    $566,815 which is still outstanding at November 30, 2001.

    On November 30, 2000 and 2001, the Company entered into unsecured notes with
    BDPT for $1,808,000 and $600,000, respectively. These unsecured notes
    contain various restrictive covenants which include, among others,
    limitations on loans and contingent liabilities except in the normal course
    of business. As of November 30, 2001, the Company was in compliance with all
    of these covenants.

 6. LEASE COMMITMENTS

    The Company's administrative offices and retail locations are leased under
    noncancelable operating lease agreements that expire from 2003 to 2016. Most
    of these leases contain renewal options of 3 to 35 years. Certain of the
    lease agreements for retail locations require the payment of contingent
    rentals based on a percentage of sales above stipulated levels. No
    contingent rental expense was incurred during 2001 or 2000. Certain of the
    lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses that are not significant.
    Total rent expense for 2001 and 2000 was $6,242,000 and $6,201,000,
    respectively. Rent expense related to locations owned or leased from the
    Members was $3,952,000 in 2001 and $3,823,000 in 2000.

    Future minimum lease commitments for the office and retail locations under
    operating leases having initial terms in excess of one year are as follows:

    Subsequent to November 30, 2001, the Company sold one store to a third
    party. The third party assumed the lease related to the store (see Note 11).
    As such, the lease commitment related to this store is not included in the
    future minimum lease commitments above.

    Additionally, Bassett will be assuming the "Bassett" and substantially all
    of the "Other" lease commitments detailed above in connection with the
    planned sale of certain stores to Bassett (see Note 11).


 7. OTHER RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

    Substantially all purchases of merchandise inventories are made from Bassett
    and its affiliates. These related entities sell products to the Company at
    prices and terms equal to their normal selling prices and terms to unrelated
    entities. Accounts payable due to these related parties was $9,230,000 and
    $10,534,000 in 2001 and 2000, respectively.

    Interest expense on borrowings from related parties as described in Note 5
    was $789,000 in 2001 and $173,000 in 2000. Portions of these amounts are
    included in notes payable to Members and deferred interest payable in the
    accompanying balance sheets at November 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

    The Company paid salaries to principals of the Members for administrative
    and executive services in the amount of $300,000 in both 2001 and 2000.

 8. BENEFIT PLAN

    EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN

    The Company maintains a qualified 401(k) employee savings plan covering
    substantially all full-time employees. Under the plan, employees may elect
    to contribute up to 15% of their compensation annually. Under the plan, the
    Company is not required to make contributions to the plan and no
    contributions were made in 2001 or 2000.

                                      -8-

 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

    EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

    The Company has certain obligations under various employment agreements
    through November 30, 2004, that stipulate, among other things, certain
    levels of compensation, bonus potential, other miscellaneous benefits and
    severance arrangements. Potential contingent liabilities under these
    arrangements approximate $450,000.

    LITIGATION

    The Company is involved in various legal proceedings encountered in the
    normal course of business. In the opinion of management, based on the
    factors presently known, the resolution of these matters will not have a
    material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or future
    results of operations.

10. MEMBERS' DEFICIT

    The Members' deficit account in the accompanying balance sheets reflects the
    initial capital contributed by the Members of $2,677,489 and all losses of
    the Company since inception. No distributions have been made to the Members
    since inception. Under the terms of the Limited Liability Company Agreement
    (the LLC Agreement), profits and losses and any distributions of the Company
    are allocated to its members based upon the Members' relative ownership
    interests in the Company and are made at the sole discretion of the Board of
    Managers. Members may not assign or transfer their rights without consent of
    the other Member. Both Members have two positions each in the Board of
    Managers. There is a single class of Members with the same rights, powers,
    duties, obligations, preferences and privileges. Each Member's liability is
    limited to the sum of its capital contributions, its share of any
    undistributed assets of the Company and any amounts previously distributed
    to it from the Company.

    As stated in the Articles of Organization, the latest date on which the
    Company is to dissolve is November 30, 2019.

11. SALES AND CLOSURE OF RETAIL STORES

    In December 2000, the Company sold its retail store operation in Columbia,
    South Carolina, to an unrelated local furniture retailer. The transaction
    involved the sale of inventory, property, equipment and leasehold
    improvements. The buyer also assumed the customer deposit liability and the
    future lease commitments for the store facility. The Company incurred a loss
    of $97,000 primarily related to the disposal of property and equipment. As
    management made the decision to dispose of this store before year-end and
    management knew that the book value of the property exceeded fair value at
    year-end, management accrued for these impaired assets in the accompanying
    2000 statement of operations and changes in members' deficit.

    The Company sold its retail furniture store in Knoxville, Tennessee, in
    January 2001 to an unrelated third party. Substantially all of the inventory
    in that location had been sold through a liquidation sale that began in
    September 2000. The lease for this location has been assumed by an unrelated
    third party, who will utilize the store as a "Bassett Furniture Direct"
    store going forward. Losses due to this transaction were insignificant.

<PAGE>
                                                                      F-28

                                      -9-

    The Company closed its retail furniture store in Fredericksburg, Virginia,
    in March 2001. Substantially all of the inventory in that location was
    liquidated by May 2001. The lease for this location was terminated by
    Bassett, the owner of the property, concurrent with the closure of the
    store. Losses due to the closure of this store were insignificant.

    The Company sold its retail furniture store in Hickory, North Carolina, to
    Bassett in July 2001. The principal terms of the agreement called for
    inventory and property to be sold at net book value to Bassett.
    Additionally, Bassett assumed the customer deposit liability and the lease
    of the retail facility in Hickory. There was no gain or loss associated with
    this transaction.

    The Company sold its retail furniture store in Greenville, South Carolina,
    to an unrelated third party, in August 2001. The transaction involved the
    sale of inventory, property, equipment and leasehold improvements. The buyer
    also assumed the customer deposit liability and the future lease commitments
    for the store. The Company incurred a loss of approximately $140,000
    primarily related to the disposal of property and equipment.

    Subsequent to November 30, 2001, the Company sold its retail furniture store
    in Louisville, Kentucky to an unrelated local furniture retailer. The
    purchaser has purchased substantially all assets and assumed all liabilities
    of the store. Related losses on this transaction are not significant.

    Subsequent to November 30, 2001, the Company and Bassett entered into an
    agreement in principle to restructure the balance sheet and streamline the
    operations of the Company. The agreement calls for Bassett to forgive debt
    due by the Company of $2,150,000. Also, as part of the agreement, the
    Company will sell the five remaining stores in North Carolina and Virginia
    to Bassett for net book value as of the effective date of the agreement of
    approximately $188,000 ($5,405,000 of assets and $5,217,000 of liabilities)
    including bank debt of approximately $1,481,000.

    Sales related to all stores sold, closed or planned to be sold included in
    the statement of operations and changes in Members' deficit for the year
    ended November 30, 2001, were $27,944,000 and related loss from operations
    was $4,892,000.
