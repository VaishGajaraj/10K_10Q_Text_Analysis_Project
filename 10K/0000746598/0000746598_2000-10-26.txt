BUSINESS STRATEGY

         Brady's mission is to be the world leader in identification and
material solutions that help companies improve productivity, performance, safety
and security. The Company expects to accomplish this objective by offering a
broad range of high-quality, innovative products to a widely diversified
customer base in a prompt and responsive manner. Underlying the Company's
business strategy is a Company-wide commitment to enhancing shareholder value.
The Company's long-term focus on activities that will create sustainable value
for its shareholders drives decision making at all levels of the Company. The
Company's employees participate in an incentive plan that is focused upon the
creation of shareholder value. This incentive plan serves to motivate employees,
foster a team-oriented work environment and maximize the utilization of assets.
Key elements of the Company's business strategy include:

         Product innovation. The Company continually seeks to improve existing
products and to develop innovative products to satisfy its customers'
requirements and expectations. Brady's commitment to product innovation is
reflected in research and development efforts that include approximately 200
employees primarily dedicated to research and development activities in the
United States, Canada, Belgium, France and Singapore.

         Breadth of product line. The Company's products include over 50,000
stock as well as custom items. The number of products offered allows Brady to
serve as a one-stop shopping network for its customers. Additionally, management
believes that the Company provides a broader range of identification solutions
than any of its competitors.

         Focus on customers. The Company seeks to provide "seamless" customer
service and to offer rapid response to customer orders and inquiries. To meet
this goal, the Company has streamlined its manufacturing processes to shorten
lead-times and has increased its investment in telecommunications and management
information systems worldwide.

         Niche markets. The Company strives to be a major player in niche
markets that allow the Company to leverage its capabilities in specialty
materials, die-cut parts and printing systems. By focusing on specific markets
and value-added product applications, the Company has established leading
positions in the electrical and safety markets with certain of its products such
as wire markers, pipe markers, safety signs and printing systems. It also is a
leader in precision die-cut materials and bar-code label generation software.

GROWTH STRATEGY

         The major elements of the Company's strategy for growth include:

         New products and new markets. The Company, through its strong product
innovation and development activities, seeks continually to introduce new
products and explore additional applications for its products in existing and
new markets.

         Increased market penetration. The Company seeks to increase market
penetration in existing domestic and international markets through existing
distribution channels and strong sales and marketing efforts. To achieve this
objective, the Company is aligning more closely with distributors, expanding its
current sales force and is pursuing additional niche distribution channels.



                                       I-2


<PAGE>   6


         Geographic expansion. Sales from Brady's international operations have
increased from $50,707,000 or 26.5% of net sales in fiscal 1990 to $240,079,000,
or 44.4%, of net sales in fiscal 2000. The Company believes that international
markets continue to represent a significant growth opportunity. Accordingly, the
Company is actively seeking to increase its penetration in established markets
in Europe, Asia/Pacific and Canada and to enter new emerging markets elsewhere
in the Pacific Rim and in Latin America.

         Strategic acquisitions and joint ventures. While the Company intends to
continue pursuing internal growth through the above strategies, the Company also
intends, where practical, to fill product lines or market sectors, open new
geographic markets and strengthen its offerings through the pursuit of strategic
acquisitions and joint ventures. During the last three years, Brady's growth has
occurred through strategic acquisitions, innovative product development and
improvement, market expansion and increased market penetration.

         E-business. E-Business will help support growth as the Company works to
make every Brady business an electronic or Internet-enabled business. Brady is
striving to do at least 50 percent of the Company's business electronically
within the next three to five years. Investments in e-commerce and information
technology have been increased to help the Company achieve this goal.

PRODUCTS

         The Company's products consist of over 50,000 stock and thousands of
custom items as well as complete identification systems that are used by the
Company's customers to create a safer work environment for employees, improve
product and operating efficiencies and increase the utilization of assets
through tracking and inventory process controls. Major product categories
include: industrial identification and data-collection products including wire
and cable markers, high-performance labels, stand-alone printing systems,
barcode and other software, radio frequency identification tags and readers and
other automatic identification and data collection systems; safety and facility

MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND RAW MATERIALS

         The Company manufactures the majority of the products it sells, while
purchasing certain items from other manufacturers. Products manufactured by the
Company generally require a high degree of precision and the application of
adhesives with chemical and physical properties suited for specific uses. The
Company's manufacturing processes include compounding, coating, converting,
software publishing and printer engineering and assembly. The compounding
process involves the mixing of chemical batches for primers, top coatings and
adhesives, in solvent- or water-based materials. The coatings and adhesives are
applied to a wide variety of materials including polyester, polyimide, cloth,
paper, metal and metal foil. The converting process may include embossing,
perforating, laminating, die cutting or slitting and printing or marking the
materials as required.

         The Company seeks to optimize the performance, quality and durability
of its products, while continually improving manufacturing processes, shortening
lead times and lowering manufacturing costs. The Company produces the majority
of its own adhesive stocks and top-coated materials through an integrated
manufacturing process. These integrated manufacturing processes permit it to
achieve greater flexibility in product design and manufacture and to improve its
ability to provide specialized products designed to meet the needs of specific
applications. Brady's "cellular" manufacturing processes and "just-in-time"
inventory control allow it to attain profitability in small orders by
emphasizing flexibility and the maximization of assets through quick turnaround
and delivery. Most of the Company's manufacturing facilities have received ISO
9001 or 9002 certification.

         The materials used in the products manufactured by the Company consist
primarily of plastic sheets and films (primarily polyesters and polycarbonates),
paper, metal and metal foil, cloth, fiberglass, inks, dyes, adhesives, pigments,
natural and synthetic rubber, organic chemicals, polymers and solvents. The
Company purchases its raw materials from many suppliers and is not dependent
upon any single supplier for any of its base supply materials.

TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

         The Company focuses its research and development efforts on
applications in the science of surface chemistry, such as coatings, adhesives
and physical bonding. This dedication to surface chemistry, in combination with
a manufacturing technology oriented to adhesives and graphics, has led to the
development of many proprietary release coatings, adhesives and products that
are adhesively fastened.

         The Company possesses patents covering various aspects of adhesive
chemistry, electronic circuitry, computer-generated wire markers, and systems
for aligning letters and patterns. Although the Company believes that its
patents are a significant factor in maintaining its market position as to
certain products, technology in the areas covered by many of the patents is
evolving rapidly and may limit the value of such patents. The Company's business
is not dependent on any single patent or group of patents.







                                       I-7


<PAGE>   11

accounted for 44.4%, 44.6%, and 43.5%, respectively, of the Company's net sales
The Company's global infrastructure includes subsidiaries in Australia, Belgium,
Brazil, Canada, China, England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico,
Singapore, Spain and Sweden and sales offices in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Taiwan. Several of these locations manufacture or have the
capability to manufacture certain of the products they sell. The Company
acquired or opened new operations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France
and the Philippines in the last three years. The Company expects to continue to
expand its international operations as appropriate.

COMPETITION

         The markets for most of the Company's products are competitive. The
Company believes that it is the leading domestic producer of self-adhesive wire
markers, safety signs, pipe markers, audio and video splicing tapes, precision
die-cut materials and bar-code label generating software. The Company competes
for business principally on the basis of product quality, performance, range of
products offered and to a lesser extent, on price. Product quality is determined
by factors such as suitability of component materials for various applications,
adhesive properties, graphics quality, durability, product consistency and
workmanship. Competition in many of the Company's product markets is highly
fragmented, ranging from smaller companies offering only one or a few types of
products, to some of the world's major adhesive and electrical product companies
offering some competing products as part of their product line. A number of the
Company's competitors are larger than the Company and have greater resources.
Notwithstanding the resources of these competitors, management believes that the
Company provides a broader range of identification solutions than any of its
competitors.

BACKLOG

         As of July 31, 2000, the amount of the Company's backlog orders
believed to be firm was approximately $27,100,000. This compares with
approximately $22,300,000 and $20,400,000 of backlog orders as of July 31, 1999
and 1998, respectively. Average delivery time for the Company's orders varies
from one day to 12 weeks, depending on the type of product, and whether the
product is stock or custom designed and manufactured.

ENVIRONMENT

         At present, the manufacturing processes for the Company's
adhesive-based products utilize certain evaporative solvents which, unless
controlled, would be vented into the atmosphere. Emissions of these substances
are regulated at the federal, state and local levels. During the past several
years, the Company has implemented a number of procedures to reduce atmospheric
emissions and/or to recover solvents. Management believes the Company is
substantially in compliance with all environmental regulations.

EMPLOYEES

         As of July 31, 2000, the Company employed approximately 3,100
individuals. The Company has never experienced a material work stoppage due to a

with employees to be excellent. To meet present and future labor requirements,
the Company maintains an active college recruiting program for sales, technical
and administrative personnel.

(1)      The options granted October 14, 1999, become exercisable as follows: 33
         1/3% of the shares on October 14, 2000; 33 1/3% of the shares on
         October 14, 2001; and 33 1/3% of the shares on October 14, 2002. These
         options have a term of ten years.

         The options granted to Mrs. Hudson on November 17, 1999, become
         exercisable January 01, 2004, and have a term of ten years.

(2)      The exercise price is the average of the highest and lowest sale prices
         of the Company's Class A Common Stock as reported by the New York Stock
         Exchange on the date of the grant.

(3)      Represents total potential appreciation of approximately 0%, 63% and
         159% for assumed annual rates of appreciation of 0%, 5% and 10%,
         respectively, compounded annually for the ten year option term.

(4)      Calculated from the $30.5625 exercise price applicable to the options
         granted on October 14, 1999 and the $33.7500 exercise price applicable
         to the options granted on November 17, 1999 based on the 20,867,965
         shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding on November 17, 1999.

(5)      Represents potential realizable value for all options granted in fiscal
         2000 compared to the increase in market value of Brady Corporation
         Class A Common Stock at assumed rates of stock price appreciation.

(6)      The Company disavows the ability of any valuation model to predict or
         estimate the Company's future stock price or to place a reasonably
         accurate present value on these options because any model depends on

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

         Each director who is also an employee of the Company receives no
additional compensation for service on the Board or on any committee of the
Board. Directors who are not also employees of the Company receive an annual
retainer of $20,000 plus $1,500 for each committee they chair and $1,250 plus
expenses for each meeting of the Board or any committee thereof which they
attend and are a member. Directors receive $750 for each meeting they attend of
any committee for which they are not a member.


TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS

         In May 1997, the Board approved Change in Control Agreements for
certain of its executive officers including Mrs. Hudson, Messrs. Fisk,
Schroeder, Hawke and Jaehnert. The agreements call for payment of an amount
equal to two times the annual salary for Mrs. Hudson and Messrs. Fisk, Schroeder
and Hawke, and payment of one time his annual salary for Mr. Jaehnert in the
event of termination or resignation upon a change of control. The agreements
also call for reimbursement of any excise taxes imposed and up to $25,000 of
attorney fees to enforce the executive's rights under the agreement. Payments
under the agreements will be spread over two years for Mrs. Hudson and Messrs.
Fisk, Schroeder and Hawke, and over one year for Mr. Jaehnert. In August 1998,
the Board amended the Change in Control Agreement for Mr. Jaehnert to call for
payment of an amount equal to two times his annual salary in the event of
termination or resignation upon a change in control with payments spread over
two years.

         In May 1997, the Company created a Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan (SERP) for Mr. Fisk. The Plan calls for the Company to credit a deferred
compensation account with $200,000 on August 1 of each year beginning August 1,
1997, to and including August 1, 2001, provided Mr. Fisk is employed by the
Company as of each of those dates. Interest accrues on the balance in the
account at the prime rate in effect on August 1 of each year, but not less than
6% nor more than 10% per annum.

         The Company is required to pay Mr. Fisk the balance in the account over
a ten year period beginning on August 1 of the year following his termination of
employment with the Company. The first payment, and the nine succeeding
payments, will equal one-tenth of the balance in the account. Succeeding
payments will include interest credited to the account in the interim. The
Company may make payments in some other manner provided the payments are neither
smaller nor extend beyond such ten year period.

         In fiscal 1994 the Company created a Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan (SERP) for Mrs. Hudson. The stated amount of the Plan at January 1, 1999,
was $500,000. The Company credited a deferred compensation account with the net
present value of the stated amount in January 1994. The account is credited
annually with the current year's increase in the net present value calculation.
After January 1, 1999, interest accrues quarterly on the balance in the account
at the prime rate in effect at the end of each calendar quarter.

         The Company is required to pay Mrs. Hudson the balance in the account
over a ten year period beginning January 2009. The first payment will be
one-tenth of the balance in the account; the second one-ninth; and so on.

<PAGE>   28
         In the event of a change in control of the Company, Mrs. Hudson's SERP
may accelerate and become payable in 30 days.

RESTRICTED STOCK

         In August 1997, the Company granted restricted stock awards to certain
key executives. Mrs. Hudson was awarded 50,000 shares of authorized, but
unissued, Class A Common Stock and Messrs. Fisk, Schroeder and Hawke were
awarded 25,000 shares each of authorized, but unissued Class A Common Stock. The
restricted stock awards granted Mrs. Hudson and Mr. Fisk vest on August 1, 2002.
The restricted stock awards granted Mr. Schroeder and Mr. Hawke vest 75% on
August 1, 2002, with the remaining 25% vesting on August 1, 2003. The executives
have the right to receive any cash dividends payable on these shares.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

         During fiscal 2000, the Board's Compensation Committee was composed of
Messrs. Bemis, Jarc and Peirce. Mr. Lettenberger serves as a nonvoting advisor
to the Committee. None of these persons has at any time been an employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries. There are no relationships among the
Company's executive officers, members of the Compensation Committee or entities
whose executives serve on the Board that require disclosure under applicable SEC
regulations.

MONEY PURCHASE AND 401K PLAN

         Substantially all Brady employees in the United States and certain
expatriate employees working for its international subsidiaries are eligible to
participate in the Company's Money Purchase and Employee 401K Plan (the
"BradyGold 401K Plan"). Under this plan the Company agrees to contribute certain
amounts to the BradyGold 401K Plan. Under the Money Purchase Plan, the Company
first contributes 4% of the eligible earnings of each person covered by the
Money Purchase Plan. In addition, participants may elect to have their annual
pay reduced by up to 4% and have the amount of this reduction contributed to the
BradyGold 401K Plan by the Company and matched by an additional, equal
contribution by the Company. Participants may also elect to have up to another
8% of their eligible earnings contributed to the BradyGold 401K Plan (without an
additional matching contribution by the Company). The assets of the BradyGold
401K and Money Purchase Plans credited to each participant are invested by the
BradyGold 401K and Money Purchase Plan trustee as directed in several investment
funds as permitted by the BradyGold 401K and Money Purchase Plans. The annual
contributions and forfeitures allocated to any participant under all defined
contribution plans may not exceed the lesser of $30,000 or 25% of the
participant's base compensation and bonuses. Benefits are generally payable upon
the death, disability, or retirement of the participant or upon termination of
employment before retirement, although benefits may also be withdrawn from the
BradyGold 401K Plan and paid to the participant if required for certain
emergencies. Under certain specified circumstances, the BradyGold 401K Plan
allows loans to be drawn on a participant's account. The participant is
immediately fully vested with respect to the contributions attributable to
reductions in pay; all other contributions become fully vested after five years
of service.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

         During fiscal 1998, the Company adopted new deferred compensation plans
whereby directors, executive officers, corporate staff officers and certain key
management employees of the Company are permitted to defer portions of their
fees, salary and bonus into a plan account, the value which is measured by the
Company's Class A Common Stock. Participants in the old deferred compensation
plan were allowed to convert their balances in the old plan to this new plan.
The conversion to the new plan was funded by the issuance of 372,728 shares of
Class A Common Stock to a Rabbi Trust (the "Trust") in November 1997. All
deferrals into the new plan result in purchases of existing Class A Common Stock
by the Trust. No deferrals are allowed into the old plan.

         Upon the retirement, disability, or death of participant, the Company
is required under the new plan to pay, each year for a period of ten years, a
portion of the shares held in the participant's name by the Trust. The first
payment must be one-tenth of the number of shares held; the second one-ninth;
and so on, with the number of shares held in the Trust reduced by each payment.

         If the participant's employment ends for reasons other than retirement,
disability or death, the shares held by the Trust in the participant's name will
be distributed over a period of ten years. At the request of the participant and
for special situations at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee, the
Company may make distributions in larger installments or in a lump sum or other
basis.

         In the old deferred compensation plan, directors, executive officers,
corporate staff officers and certain key management employees of the Company
were permitted to defer portions of their fees, salary and bonus into a plan,
the value of which was measured in "phantom stock" of the Company. "Phantom
Stock" is not actual stock or rights to acquire stock in the Company, but it
gives participants the right to share in increases in book value (as defined) of
the common stock. At the end of each fiscal year, the deferred compensation
balance (with interest) is credited to the purchase of phantom common stock at
the then book value of the common stock of the Company, and is thereafter
adjusted to reflect stock dividends and other dividends or distributions on the
Company's Class A Common Stock. No new deferrals are allowed into this old
deferred compensation plan. Upon the retirement, disability, or death of
participant, the Company is required to pay, each year for a period of ten
years, a portion of the book value of the phantom stock determined by the book
value of the corresponding number of common shares as of the end of each fiscal
year. The first payment must be one-tenth of the book value; the second
one-ninth; and so on, with the number of phantom shares reduced by the
equivalent in book value of each payment. At the request of the participant, the
Company may make payments in larger installments or in a lump sum on a
discounted or other basis.

         All current directors and executives converted their balances to the
new deferred compensation plan. Certain retired participants elected not to
transfer their balances into the new plan. They were allowed to remain in the
old deferred compensation plan until the end of fiscal 2002. At that point the
old plan will terminate and participant's balances will earn simple interest at
a rate equal to the yield on a 30-year U.S. Treasury Bond as of July 31 of each
year.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

         The Company's Compensation Committee (the "Committee") is composed
entirely of outside directors and is responsible for considering and approving
compensation arrangements for senior management of the Company, including the
Company's executive officers and the chief executive officer. It is the
philosophy of the Committee to establish a total executive compensation program
which is competitive with a broad range of companies that it considers to be of
comparable size and complexity.

         The primary components of the Company's executive compensation program
are (i) base salary, (ii) annual shareholder value enhancement plan cash bonuses
and (iii) long term incentive compensation in the form of stock options and/or
restricted stock. These are designed to align shareholder and management
interests, to balance the achievement of annual performance targets with actions
that focus on the long-term success of the Company, and to attract, motivate and
retain key executives who are important to the continued success of the Company.
Decisions made by the Committee relating to the base salary compensation and the
annual cash incentive compensation plan are reviewed and approved by the full
Board of Directors.

         The Committee believes that:

      -  The Company's pay levels are appropriately targeted to attract and
         retain key executives;
      -  The Company's incentive plan provides strong incentives for management
         to increase shareholder value; and
      -  The Company's total executive compensation program is a cost-effective
         strategy to increase shareholder value.

Base Salary

         Consistent with the Committee's philosophy, base salaries are generally
maintained at or modestly above competitive base salary levels. Competitive
salary level is defined as the average base salary for similar responsibilities
in a group of companies selected by the Committee that the Committee considers
to be of comparable size and complexity. In setting base salaries for fiscal
2000, the Committee reviewed compensation survey data and was satisfied that the
base salary levels set would achieve the Company's objectives. Specific
increases reflect the Committee's subjective evaluation of individual
performance.

Annual Shareholder Value Enhancement Plan

         The shareholder value enhancement plan (the "Bonus Plan") provides for
the annual payment of cash bonuses. When viewed together with the Company's base
salary, the purpose of the Bonus Plan is to provide a balance between fixed
compensation and variable, results-oriented compensation. The Bonus Plan is 90%
objective. It stresses maximization of Company profitability and increasing
shareholder value.

<PAGE>   31
Stock Options

         In May 1997, the Company approved the Brady Corporation 1997 Omnibus
Incentive Stock Plan and the Brady Corporation 1997 Nonqualified Stock Option
Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Option Plans") under which 2,000,000
shares and 125,000 shares, respectively, of Class A Common Stock are available
for grant. In 1989 the Board approved the Brady Corporation 1989 Non-Qualified
Stock Option Plan (the "Option Plan") under which 1,500,000 shares of Class A
Common Stock were available for grant. The Option Plans assist directors,
executive officers, corporate staff officers and key management employees in
becoming shareholders with an important stake in the Company's future, aligning
their personal financial interest with that of all shareholders. Stock options
are typically granted annually and have a term of ten years. Generally, the
options become one-third exercisable one year after the date of the grant and
one-third additional in each of the succeeding two years so that at the end of
three years after the date of the grant they are fully exercisable. All grants
under the Option Plans are at market price on the date of the grant.

Compliance with Tax Regulations Regarding Executive Compensation

         Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, added by the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, generally disallows a tax deduction to public
companies for compensation over $1 million paid to the corporation's chief
executive officer and the other named executive officers. Qualifying
performance-based compensation will not be subject to the deduction limit if
certain requirements are met. The Company's executive compensation program, as
currently constructed, is not likely to generate nondeductible compensation in
excess of these limits. The Compensation Committee will continue to review these
tax regulations as they apply to the Company's executive compensation program.
It is the Compensation Committee's intent to preserve the deductibility of
executive compensation to the extent reasonably practicable and to the extent
consistent with its other compensation objectives.

Compensation of the Chief Executive Officer

         Mrs. Hudson received $470,308 in base salary in fiscal 2000, an
increase of 6.5% from the prior year's base salary. She was paid a bonus
attributable to fiscal 2000 of $535,963, an increase of 1.1%, or $6,071, from
the prior year's bonus. The bonus was determined in accordance with the
Company's objective Bonus Plan, discussed above. Mrs. Hudson's compensation
reflects:

      (i)         an increase of 16.6%, or $6,496,000, in profits (after
                  removing the effects of the nonrecurring items) and 14.9% in
                  sales over similar amounts from the prior year; a decrease of
                  13%, from $35.00 to $30.44, in the Company's stock price
      (ii)        the successful acquisitions of certain assets of Champion
                  America, Inc., Data Recognition, Inc. and Imtec, Inc. this
                  year and the integration of last year's acquisitions VEB
                  Sistemas de Etiquetas Ltda., Barcodes West Inc., Visi Sign
                  Pty. Ltd., Holman Groupe S.A. and the graphics division of
                  SOFT S.A.
      (iii)       continued improvement in asset utilization (a 9.8% increase in
                  inventory despite the 14.9% increase in sales)
      (iv)        continued efforts to focus the Company's resources on
                  sustainable value-enhancing long-term growth
      (v)         continued improvement in intercompany teamwork.

         During fiscal 2000, Mrs. Hudson was awarded options to purchase 82,000
shares of Class A Common Stock.

         The Committee believes these awards are consistent with the objectives
of the various plans and with the overall compensation policy of the Board of
Directors.


                 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

         The Compensation Committee believes the executive compensation programs
and practices described above are competitive. They are designed to provide
increased compensation with improved financial results and provide additional
opportunity for capital accumulation, but only if shareholder value is
increased.
