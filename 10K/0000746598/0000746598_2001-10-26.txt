warn, inform, train and protect people. The Company manufactures and sells
products domestically and internationally through multiple channels including
direct sales, distributor sales, mail-order catalog and telemarketing and
electronic access through the Internet. The Company has a broad customer base,
which in fiscal 2001 consisted of more than 300,000 companies, with the largest
customer representing less than 5% of net sales. Sales from international
operations represented 44.0% of net sales in fiscal 2001.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

     Brady's mission is to be the world leader in identification and material
solutions that help companies improve productivity, performance, safety and
security. The Company expects to accomplish this objective by offering a broad
range of high-quality, innovative products to a widely diversified customer base
in a prompt and responsive manner. Underlying the Company's business strategy is
a Company-wide commitment to enhancing shareholder value. The Company's
long-term focus on activities that will create sustainable value for
shareholders drives decision making at all levels of the Company. The Company's
employees participate in an incentive plan that is focused upon the creation of
shareholder value. This incentive plan is designed to

                                       I-1
<PAGE>

motivate employees, foster a team-oriented work environment and maximize the
utilization of assets. Key elements of the Company's business strategy include:

     Product innovation.  The Company continually seeks to improve existing
products and to develop innovative products to satisfy customers' requirements
and expectations. Brady's commitment to product innovation is reflected in
research and development efforts that include approximately 200 employees
primarily dedicated to research and development activities in the United States,
Canada, Belgium, France and Singapore.

     Breadth of product line.  The Company's products include over 50,000 stock
as well as custom items. The number of products offered allows Brady to serve as
a one-stop shopping network for customers. Additionally, management believes
that the Company provides a broader range of identification solutions than any
of its competitors.

     Focus on customers.  The Company seeks to provide "seamless" customer
service and to offer rapid response to customer orders and inquiries. To meet
this goal, the Company has streamlined its manufacturing processes to shorten
lead-times and has increased investment in telecommunications and management
information systems worldwide.

     Niche markets.  The Company strives to be a major player in niche markets
that allow the Company to leverage its capabilities in specialty materials,
die-cut parts and printing systems. By focusing on specific markets and
value-added product applications, the Company has established leading positions
in the electrical and safety markets with certain products such as wire markers,
pipe markers, safety signs and printing systems. It also is a leader in
precision die-cut materials and bar-code label generation software.

GROWTH STRATEGY

     The major elements of the Company's strategy for growth include:

     New products and new markets.  The Company, through strong product
innovation and development activities, seeks continually to introduce new
products and explore additional applications for products in existing and new
markets.

     Increased market penetration.  The Company seeks to increase market
penetration in existing domestic and international markets through existing
distribution channels and strong sales and marketing efforts. To achieve this
objective, the Company's goal is to align more closely with distributors, expand
its current sales force and pursue additional channels.

     Geographic expansion.  Sales from Brady's international operations have
increased from $50,707,000 or 26.5% of net sales in fiscal 1990 to $239,040,000,
or 44.0%, of net sales in fiscal 2001. The Company believes that international
markets continue to represent a significant growth opportunity. Accordingly, the
Company is actively seeking to increase penetration in established markets in
Europe, Asia/Pacific and Canada and to enter new emerging markets elsewhere in
Eastern Europe, the Pacific Rim and Latin America.

     Strategic acquisitions and joint ventures.  While the Company intends to
continue pursuing internal growth through the above strategies, the Company also
intends, where practical, to fill product lines or market sectors, open new
geographic markets and strengthen product offerings through the pursuit of
strategic acquisitions and joint ventures. Between 1999 and 2001, Brady's growth
has occurred through strategic acquisitions, innovative product development and
improvement, market expansion and increased market penetration.

     E-business.  E-Business will help support growth as the Company works to
make every Brady business an electronic or Internet-enabled business. Brady is
striving to transact 50 percent of the Company's business electronically within
the next three years. Investments in e-commerce and information technology have
been increased to help the Company achieve this goal.

                                       I-2

consumable supplies. It provides lettering and labeling systems, poster
printers, laminators and supplies to education and training markets.

OTHER PRODUCTS

     The Company also sells a variety of other products, none of which
individually accounts for a material portion of its sales, including: hospital
and clinical labels, packing and shipping goods, name plates, and quality and
production control products, among others.

MARKETING AND SALES

     The Company's products are sold in a wide variety of markets including
electrical, electronic, telecommunications, governmental, public utility,
computer, construction, transportation equipment and education. Brady has a
diverse customer base that consisted of over 300,000 customers in fiscal 2001.
No material part of the Company's business is dependent upon a single customer
or group of customers, and the loss of a particular customer would not have a
material adverse effect upon the Company's business. In fiscal 2001, no single
customer accounted for more than 5% of the Company's net sales.

     The Company seeks to offer the right product with rapid response times and
superior service so that it can provide solutions to the customer that are
better, faster and more economical than those available from competitors. The
Company markets and sells its products domestically and internationally through
multiple channels including direct sales, distributor sales, mail-order-catalog
marketing and electronic access through the Internet. The Company currently has
over 4,000 established relationships with a broad range of electrical, safety,
industrial and other domestic and international distributors. To support its
distributor network, the Company employs a sales force of over 500 people. The
Company's sales force seeks to establish and foster ongoing relationships with
the end-users (and distributors) by providing technical support and product-
application advice.

     The Company direct markets its products and those of other manufacturers by
catalog sales in both domestic and international markets. Such products include
industrial and facility identification products, safety and
regulatory-compliance products and OEM component products, among others. Catalog
operations are conducted through offices in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada,
England, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, and include foreign-language
catalogs.

MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND RAW MATERIALS

     The Company manufactures the majority of the products it sells, while
purchasing certain items from other manufacturers. Products manufactured by the
Company generally require a high degree of precision and the application of
adhesives with chemical and physical properties suited for specific uses. The
Company's manufacturing processes include compounding, coating, converting,
software publishing and printer engineering and assembly. The compounding
process involves the mixing of chemical batches for primers, top coatings and
adhesives, in solvent- or water-based materials. The coatings and adhesives are
applied to a wide variety of materials including polyester, polyimide, cloth,
paper, metal and metal foil. The converting process may include embossing,
perforating, laminating, die cutting or slitting, and printing or marking the
materials as required.

     The Company seeks to optimize the performance, quality and durability of
their products, while continually improving manufacturing processes, shortening
lead times and lowering manufacturing costs. The

                                       I-5
<PAGE>

Company produces the majority of the adhesive stocks and top-coated materials
through an integrated manufacturing process. These integrated manufacturing
processes permit it to achieve greater flexibility in product design and
manufacture, and to improve its ability to provide specialized products designed
to meet the needs of specific applications. Brady's "cellular" manufacturing
processes and "just-in-time" inventory control allow it to attain profitability
in small orders by emphasizing flexibility and the maximization of assets
through quick turnaround and delivery. Most of the Company's manufacturing
facilities have received ISO 9001 or 9002 certification.

     The materials used in the products manufactured by the Company consist
primarily of plastic sheets and films (primarily polyesters and polycarbonates),
paper, metal and metal foil, cloth, fiberglass, inks, dyes, adhesives, pigments,
natural and synthetic rubber, organic chemicals, polymers and solvents. The
Company purchases its raw materials from many suppliers and is not dependent
upon any single supplier for any of its base supply materials.

TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

     The Company focuses its research and development efforts on applications in
the science of surface chemistry, such as coatings, adhesives and physical
bonding. This dedication to surface chemistry, in combination with a
manufacturing technology oriented to adhesives and graphics, has led to the
development of many proprietary release coatings, adhesives and products that
are adhesively fastened.

     The Company possesses patents covering various aspects of adhesive
chemistry, electronic circuitry, computer-generated wire markers, and systems
for aligning letters and patterns. Although the Company believes that its
patents are a significant factor in maintaining market position as to certain
products, technology in the areas covered by many of the patents is evolving
rapidly and may limit the value of such patents. The Company's business is not
dependent on any single patent or group of patents.

     The Company conducts much of its technology and development activities at
the Frederic S. Tobey Research and Innovation Center (approximately 39,600 sq.
ft.) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Company spent approximately $20,300,000,
$20,600,000 and $17,100,000 in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, on its
research and development activities. In fiscal 2001, approximately 200 employees
were engaged in research and development activities for the Company. Additional
research projects were conducted under contract with universities, other
institutions and consultants.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

     In Fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, sales from international operations
accounted for 44.0%, 44.4%, and 44.6%, respectively, of the Company's net sales
The Company's global infrastructure includes subsidiaries in Australia, Belgium,
Brazil, Canada, China, England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico,
Singapore, and Sweden and sales offices in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Poland and Taiwan. Several of these locations manufacture or have the capability
to manufacture certain of the products they sell. The Company acquired or opened
new operations in Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany and the Philippines
in the last three years. The Company expects to continue to expand its
international operations as appropriate.

COMPETITION

     The markets for most of the Company's products are competitive. The Company
believes that it is the leading domestic producer of self-adhesive wire markers,
safety signs, pipe markers, audio and video splicing tapes, precision die-cut
materials and bar-code-label-generating software. The Company competes for
business principally on the basis of product quality, performance, range of
products offered and to a lesser extent, on price. Product quality is determined
by factors such as suitability of component materials for various applications,
adhesive properties, graphics quality, durability, product consistency and
workmanship. Competition in many of the Company's product markets is highly
fragmented, ranging from smaller companies offering only one or a few types of
products, to some of the world's major adhesive and electrical product companies
offering some competing products as part of their product line. A number of the
Company's competitors are

                                       I-6
<PAGE>

larger than the Company and have greater resources. Notwithstanding the
resources of these competitors, management believes that the Company provides a
broader range of identification solutions than any of its competitors.

BACKLOG

     As of July 31, 2001, the amount of the Company's backlog orders believed to
be firm was approximately $22,100,000. This compares with approximately
$27,100,000 and $22,300,000 of backlog orders as of July 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Average delivery time for the Company's orders varies from one day
to one month, depending on the type of product, and whether the product is stock
or custom designed and manufactured.

ENVIRONMENT

     At present, the manufacturing processes for the Company's adhesive-based
products utilize certain evaporative solvents, which, unless controlled, would
be vented into the atmosphere. Emissions of these substances are regulated at
the federal, state and local levels. During the past several years, the Company
has implemented a number of procedures to reduce atmospheric emissions and/or to
recover solvents. Management believes the Company is substantially in compliance
with all environmental regulations.

EMPLOYEES

ITEM 6 SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

     The information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to Pages
8 and 9 of the Brady Corporation 2001 Annual Report.

ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
       OF OPERATIONS

                                    OVERVIEW

     Fiscal 2001 was demanding, difficult and disappointing. We faced weak
economies, a strong U.S. dollar, and business contraction in many markets. In
fact, U.S. industrial production in 2001 fell to levels not seen since the 1991
recession, and U.S. factories operated at their slowest pace in more than 17
years.

     For Brady, that meant a swing from 15-percent sales growth in the first
quarter to a 15-percent decline in the fourth quarter. Our sales for the year
were $545.9 million, down 0.9 percent from fiscal 2000's record $550.7 million
in sales. In local currencies, sales rose 3.3 percent to $559.1 million.

     As telecommunications, electronics and other Brady markets continued to
struggle with double-digit declines throughout the year, we focused on creative
and strategic cost-control initiatives to weather the storm. We aggressively
took steps to reduce spending, including instituting a summer hours program for
employees
                                       II-1
<PAGE>

aimed at trimming our expenses while retaining our workforce. Unfortunately our
efforts could not keep up with the dramatic business decline, and it was
necessary to take additional steps.

     To better align our operations with market conditions, we undertook a
restructuring in the fourth quarter. It included consolidating manufacturing
operations and reducing our workforce by about 5 percent. One-time charges
totaling $5.9 million after tax for this restructuring were recorded in the
fourth quarter.

YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2001, COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2000

     Sales for fiscal 2001 decreased by $4,720,000 or 0.9% from fiscal 2000.
Sales of the Company's international operations decreased 2.7% in U.S. dollars.
The acquisition of Balkhausen GmbH in March 2001 increased international sales
by 1.7%. International base business increased by 5.1% in local currencies.
These increases were more than offset by the negative effect of fluctuations in
the exchange rates used to translate financial results into U.S. currency, which
reduced international sales by 9.5%. Sales of the Company's U.S. operations
increased 0.5%, with the acquisitions of Data Recognition, Inc. and Imtec, Inc.
in March 2000 adding 5.9%, which was offset by a decline in base business of
5.4%. The Company's sales are affected by general economic conditions in its key
markets. The economic downturn in these markets in fiscal 2001 had a negative
effect on the Company's sales, which could be expected to continue if such
conditions persist.

     The cost of products sold as a percentage of sales increased from 44.6% to
47.1%. The increase was due to changes in product mix, fixed costs spread over a
lower sales volume and negative foreign exchange impact.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses (including nonrecurring
charges) as a percentage of sales increased from 39.1% to 41.0% in fiscal 2001.
This year's expenses included a nonrecurring charge of $9,560,000, primarily
relating to facilities consolidation and a workforce reduction of approximately
5%. Fiscal 2000 expenses included $4,352,000 associated with the attempt to
acquire Critchley Group. Excluding these nonrecurring items in both years,
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased
from 38.3% to 39.2%. The increase was due mainly to fixed administrative
expenses spread over a lower sales base.

     Research and development investment as a percentage of sales remained
constant at 3.7%.

     Operating income decreased $24,769,000 to $44,522,000 in fiscal 2001.
Excluding the nonrecurring items in both years (a nonrecurring charge in 2001
related to facilities consolidations and a workforce reduction and a charge in
2000 for expenses associated with the Critchley bid), operating income decreased
$19,561,000 or 26.6% from $73,643,000 to $54,082,000.

     Investment and other income decreased $6,732,000 from the prior year.
Fiscal 2000 results included a $6,766,000 before-expenses gain from the
Critchley transaction. Excluding this one-time gain, investment and other income
increased $34,000.

     Income before income taxes was $44,790,000, a decrease of 41.2% compared to
fiscal 2000's $76,131,000. Excluding the nonrecurring items in both years,
income before income taxes in 2001 decreased 26.3%.

     The Company's effective tax rate increased from 38.0% for fiscal 2000 to
38.5% for fiscal 2001.

     Net income was $27,546,000 for fiscal 2001, compared to $47,201,000 for
fiscal 2000 due to the factors discussed above. Excluding the nonrecurring
items, (a $5,879,000 nonrecurring charge after-tax in fiscal 2001 and a
$1,497,000 net gain on the Critchley bid in fiscal 2000), net income decreased
26.9% over the prior year.

YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2000, COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 1999

     Sales for fiscal 2000 increased by $71,639,000 or 15.0% over fiscal 1999.
Sales of the Company's international operations increased 14.4% in U.S. dollars.
The acquisitions of SOFT S.A. and the Holman Groupe S.A. in July 1999 and Visi
Sign Pty. Ltd. in May 1999 increased international sales by 6.6%. These
increases were somewhat offset by the negative effect of fluctuations in the
exchange rates used to translate financial results into U.S. currency, which
reduced international sales by 5.9%. Sales of the Company's U.S. operations
increased 15.3%, with 6.2 percentage points due to core growth and 9.1
percentage points from

                                       II-2
<PAGE>

the acquisitions of Barcodes West Inc. in March 1999, the brand name Champion
America, Inc. in September 1999, and Data Recognition, Inc. and Imtec, Inc. in
March 2000.

     The cost of products sold as a percentage of sales decreased from 45.1% to
44.6%. This improvement was due to changes in product mix, engineered product
cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies from the Company's continuous
improvement efforts.

     During fiscal 2000 Brady attempted to acquire Critchley Group plc in the
United Kingdom, but was outbid by another entity. While Brady did not acquire
the company, it made a net after-tax profit of $1,497,000 on an investment in
Critchley shares after $4,352,000 of expense and $917,000 of tax.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales
increased from 38.0% to 39.1% in fiscal 2000. Fiscal 2000's expenses included
$4,352,000 of expenses associated with the attempt to acquire Critchley Group,
and 1999 included a credit for adjusting the severance liability associated with
the 1998 workforce reduction. Excluding these nonrecurring items in both years,
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased
from 38.1% to 38.3%. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of sales associated with Brady's base business dropped by 1.2
percentage points. This improvement was offset by incremental non-capitalizable
expenses of approximately $7,000,000 associated with process improvements and
e-business initiatives in 2000.

     Research and development investment as a percentage of sales increased from
3.6% to 3.7%, while base-business investment in research and development
increased 14.6%.

     Operating income increased $5,519,000 to $69,291,000 in fiscal 2000.
Excluding the nonrecurring items in both years (a charge in 2000 for expenses
associated with the Critchley bid and a credit in 1999 for adjusting the
severance costs associated with the workforce reduction of 1998), operating
income increased $10,482,000 or 16.6% from $63,161,000 to $73,643,000, with the
improvement primarily from increased sales.

     Investment and other income increased $5,963,000 from the prior year.
Fiscal 2000 results included a $6,766,000 before-expenses gain from the
Critchley transaction. Excluding this one-time gain, investment and other income
decreased $803,000 as Brady experienced increased exchange losses, primarily
from the weak Euro.

     Income before income taxes was $76,131,000, an increase of 17.5% compared
to fiscal 1999's $64,782,000. Excluding the nonrecurring items in both years,
income before income taxes in 2000 increased 14.9%.

     The Company's effective tax rate decreased from 38.9% for fiscal 1999 to
38.0% for fiscal 2000.

     Net income was $47,201,000 for fiscal 2000, compared to $39,584,000 for
fiscal 1999 due to the factors discussed above. Excluding the nonrecurring
items, (a $1,497,000 net gain on the Critchley bid in fiscal 2000 and a $376,000
nonrecurring credit in fiscal 1999), net income increased 16.6% over the prior
year.

                       BUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS

IDENTIFICATION SOLUTIONS & SPECIALTY TAPES (ISST) GROUP

     ISST sales decreased 0.1% in fiscal 2001 (up 3.3% in local currencies) from
fiscal 2000, following an increase of 30.5% in fiscal 2000 versus 1999.
Base-business sales in fiscal 2001 were down 5.2% due to weakening in the global
electrical, electronic, telecommunication and automatic identification markets.
Acquisitions added 8.5% to the group's sales in fiscal 2001. Acquisitions
included Balkhausen GmbH in 2001 and Imtec, Inc. and Data Recognition, Inc. in
2000.

     Segment profit as a percentage of sales decreased from 26.5% in 2000 to
19.9% in 2001 as a result of the sales decline in the group's higher margin
products, the negative effect of foreign currencies and increased utility costs.
Comparing fiscal 2000 to 1999, segment profit as a percentage of sales increased
from 24.5% to 26.5% as a result of improved operating leverage on the existing
assets, strong growth in base business, increased segment profits from prior
acquisitions and a continued focus on aggressive cost-savings initiatives.

                                       II-3
<PAGE>

GRAPHICS GROUP

     Graphics sales decreased 1.7% in fiscal 2001 (1.0% growth in local
currencies) from fiscal 2000. Sales increased 3.8% in fiscal 2000 from fiscal
1999. In fiscal 2000, the acquisition of SOFT S.A. in France and Visi Sign Pty.
Ltd. in Australia accounted for a 6.4% increase in group sales while the base
business in Graphics declined by 2.6%. The decline was influenced by a negative
foreign-currency translation impact of 1.4%, primarily in reporting European
results, and also the discontinuation of certain non-strategic product lines.

     Segment profit as a percentage of sales in the Graphics Group improved to
23.2% from 22.9% in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 due to cost-control
measures. Segment profit as a percentage of sales in the Graphics Group declined
from 23.1% in fiscal 1999 to 22.9% in fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2000, additional
volume improved total gross margins, but this improvement was offset by costs of
integrating SOFT S.A. into the European operations and increased new product
development.

DIRECT MARKETING GROUP

     Direct Marketing Group sales decreased 1.4% in fiscal 2001 (up 5.1% in
local currencies) from fiscal 2000. The Group's sales increased 4.7% in fiscal
2000 (up 8.7% in local currencies) from fiscal 1999. The acquisition of Champion
America added 0.4% to the Group's sales in fiscal 2001. North American sales in
fiscal 2001 were up 1.7% in local currencies. In Europe, sales were down for
fiscal 2001 but showed single-digit growth in local currencies. Brazil continued
to grow at double-digit rates in fiscal 2001. The sales increase in Fiscal 2000
over 1999 was due to the acquisition of Champion America, Seton Canada realizing
strong organic growth in Canada and units in Australia and Brazil both
generating double-digit growth.

     Segment profit as a percent of sales was 28.4% in fiscal 2001 versus 26.4%
in fiscal 2000 and 27.2% in fiscal 1999. The fiscal 2001 increase was due to
continued productivity improvement in selling and marketing expenses and
refinements in mail plan techniques. The group's profits were reduced by
expenditures to improve the information technology infrastructure in Europe,
startup costs for Seton Japan and higher marketing expenses in the United
States.

                                   LIQUIDITY

     The Company's liquidity remains strong. Cash and cash equivalents were
$62,811,000 at July 31, 2001, compared to $60,784,000 at July 31, 2000, and
$75,466,000 at July 31, 1999. The decrease in 2000 was primarily due to the
Company's acquisition for cash of Data Recognition, Inc., Imtec, Inc. and
Champion America, Inc. Working capital increased $7,746,000 during fiscal 2001
and equaled $123,830,000 at July 31, 2001.

     The Company has maintained significant cash balances due in large part to
its strong operating cash flow, which totaled $53,228,000 for fiscal 2001,
$48,408,000 for fiscal 2000 and $61,357,000 for fiscal 1999.

     Capital expenditures were $20,770,000 in fiscal 2001, $22,624,000 in fiscal
2000 and $9,889,000 in fiscal 1999. Fiscal 2001's capital expenditures included
a new manufacturing location in Brazil, new software and computers and
manufacturing equipment in Europe. Fiscal 2000 capital expenditures were
primarily from capital investments related to new software, a new facility in
the United States, a startup in China and a new global telecommunications
system.

     In fiscal 2000, the Company made an unsuccessful bid for the purchase of
Critchley Group plc in the United Kingdom. Associated transactions included the
purchase of Critchley shares at a total cost of $22,931,000 in the third quarter
and the subsequent sale of the shares in the fourth quarter for $27,345,000,
before expenses.

     Financing activities required $22,676,000 in fiscal 2001, $6,605,000 in
fiscal 2000 and $12,533,000 in fiscal 1999. Cash used for dividends to
shareholders was $16,229,000 in fiscal 2001, $15,260,000 in fiscal 2000 and
$14,317,000 in fiscal 1999. In fiscal 2000, net cash borrowed was $24,947,000,
primarily used to purchase the Critchley securities, which was subsequently
repaid in fiscal 2000 and 2001.

     In fiscal 1999, the Company entered into a $150,000,000 revolving loan
agreement with six banks. In January 2000, the agreement was amended to increase
the available amount to $200,000,000, all of which was

                                       II-4
<PAGE>

available at July 31, 2001. The agreement requires the Company to maintain
certain financial covenants. The Company has obtained waivers for instances of
non-compliance through July 31, 2001. Future borrowings could be limited by the
Company's ability to maintain, waive or modify the financial covenants.

     Long-term obligations as a percentage of long-term obligations plus
stockholders' investment were 1.4% at July 31, 2001 and 2000, and 0.5% at July
31, 1999.

     The Company continues to seek opportunities to invest in new products, new
markets and in strategic acquisitions and joint ventures which fit its growth
strategy. Management believes the Company's cash and cash equivalents, available
line of credit, and the cash flow it generates from operating activities are
adequate to meet the Company's current investing and financing needs.

                                   INFLATION

     Essentially all of the Company's revenue is derived from the sale of its
products in competitive markets. Because prices are influenced by market
conditions, it is not always possible to fully recover cost increases through
pricing. Changes in product mix from year to year and timing differences in
instituting price changes make it virtually impossible to accurately define the
impact of inflation on profit margins.

                                EURO CONVERSION

     On January 1, 1999, the Euro was adopted as the national currency of 11
European Union member nations. During a three-year transition period, the Euro
will be used as a non-cash transactional currency. The Company began conducting
business in Euros in January 1999, and will change its functional currencies
during the three-year transition period. The conversion to the Euro is not
expected to have a significant operational impact or a material impact on the
results of operations, cash flows or financial condition of the Company.

                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     Matters in this Annual Report may contain forward-looking information, as
defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All such
forward-looking information in this report involves risks and uncertainties
including, but not limited to, domestic and international economic conditions
and growth rates; fluctuations in currency exchange rates for international
currencies versus the U.S. dollar; the successful implementation of a new
enterprise-resource-planning system; the ability of the Company to acquire,
integrate and achieve anticipated synergies from new businesses; the ability of
the Company to adjust its cost structure to changes in levels of sales and
product mix in a timely manner; variations in the economic or political
conditions in the countries in which the Company does business; technology
changes; the continued availability of sources of supply; and other risks
indicated in filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Company cautions that forward-looking statements are not guarantees, since
there are inherent difficulties in predicting future results, and that actual
results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in
forward-looking statements.

ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The Company's business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to
changes in foreign exchange rates. To manage that risk effectively, the Company
enters into hedging transactions, according to established guidelines and
policies, that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of this financial
market risk.

     The global nature of the Company's business requires active participation
in the foreign exchange markets. As a result of investments, production
facilities and other operations on a global scale, the Company has assets,
liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The primary
objective of the Company's foreign-exchange risk management is to minimize the
impact of currency movements on intercompany transactions and foreign
raw-material imports. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges known
exposures using forward contracts. Main exposures are related to transactions
denominated in the British Pound, the Euro (primarily the Belgian Franc,
Deutsche Mark and French Franc), Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen and Australian
Dollar. The risk of these hedging instruments is not material.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
  of Brady Corporation:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Brady
Corporation and subsidiaries as of July 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' investment and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2001. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 14. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the companies at July 31, 2001
and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended July 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

                       BRADY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                    YEARS ENDED JULY 31, 2001, 2000 AND 1999

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Principles of Consolidation -- The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Brady Corporation and its subsidiaries (the
"Company"), all of which are wholly-owned. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

     Use of Estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

     Fair Value of Financial Instruments -- The Company believes the carrying
amount of its financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and long-term debt) is a reasonable estimate of the
fair value of these instruments due to their short-term nature or variable
interest rate.

     Cash Equivalents -- The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.

     Inventories -- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost
has been determined using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for certain
inventories (approximately 55% and 61% of total inventories at July 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively) and the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method for other
inventories. The difference between the carrying value of domestic inventories
stated at LIFO cost and the value of such inventories stated at FIFO cost was
$5,805,000 at July 31, 2001 and $5,595,000 at July 31, 2000.

     Depreciation -- The cost of buildings and improvements and machinery and
equipment is being depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the
straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. The estimated useful
lives range from 3 to 33 years.

     Goodwill -- Goodwill is amortized using the straight-line method over
various periods ranging from 10 to 40 years. The weighted average amortization
period is 21 and 22 years at July 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Goodwill is
net of accumulated amortization of approximately $20,600,000 and $12,500,000 at
July 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets -- The Company evaluates whether events and
circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of
long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of an asset
may not be recoverable. The measurement of possible impairment is based on the
ability to recover the balance of assets from expected future operating cash
flows on an undiscounted basis.

     Catalog Costs -- Catalog costs are initially capitalized and amortized over
the estimated useful lives of the publications (generally eight months). At July
31, 2001 and 2000, $6,380,000 and $4,728,000 respectively, of prepaid catalog
costs were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets.

     Revenue Recognition -- The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment of
goods to customers. In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements" ("SAB 101"). The Company adopted SAB 101 in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2001. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the
Company's financial statements.

     Research and Development -- Amounts expended for research and development
are expensed as incurred.

                       BRADY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     Foreign Currency Translation -- Foreign currency assets and liabilities are
translated into United States dollars at end of period rates of exchange, and
income and expense accounts are translated at the weighted average rates of
exchange for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are included in other
comprehensive income.

     Income Taxes -- The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes," which requires an asset and liability approach to financial
accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or
deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable
to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax
payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period
in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

     New Accounting Standards -- Effective August 1, 2000, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, which requires that
all derivative instruments be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and
establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships.
The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 133 was not material to the Company's
financial statements. The Company is exposed to market risk, such as changes in
interest rates and currency exchange rates. The Company does not hold or issue
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

          Interest Rate Hedging -- The Company could be exposed to interest rate
     risk through its corporate borrowing activities. The objective of the
     Company's interest rate risk management activities is to manage the levels
     of the Company's fixed and floating interest rate exposure to be consistent
     with the Company's preferred mix. The interest rate risk management program
     consists of entering into approved interest rate derivatives when there is
     a desire to modify the Company's exposure to interest rates. As of July 31,
     2001, the Company has not entered into any interest rate derivatives.

          Currency Rate Hedging -- The primary objectives of the foreign
     exchange risk management activities are to understand and mitigate the
     impact of potential foreign exchange fluctuations on the Company's
     financial results and its economic well-being. While the Company's risk
     management objectives and strategies will be driven from an economic
     perspective, the Company will attempt, where possible and practical, to
     ensure that the hedging strategies it engages in can be treated as "hedges"
     from an accounting perspective or otherwise result in accounting treatment
     where the earnings effect of the hedging instrument provides substantial
     offset (in the same period) to the earnings effect of the hedged item.
     Generally, these risk management transactions will involve the use of
     foreign currency derivatives to protect against exposure resulting from
     intercompany sales and identified inventory or other asset purchases.

          The Company primarily utilizes forward exchange contracts with
     maturities of less than 12 months, which qualify as cash flow hedges. These
     are intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on
     forecasted sales, inventory purchases and intercompany charges. The fair
     value of these instruments at July 31, 2001 and 2000 was not material.

          Hedge effectiveness is determined by how closely the changes in the
     fair value of the hedging instrument offset the changes in the fair value
     or cash flows of the hedged item. Hedge accounting is permitted only if the
     hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective at the inception of
     the hedge and on an on-going basis. Any ineffective portions are to be
     recognized in earnings immediately. The Company's existing cash flow hedges
     are considered to be 100% effective. As a result, there is no current
     impact to earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.

                                      II-13

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

          No cash flow hedges were discontinued during the year ended July 31,
     2001.

     In May 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached consensus on
Issue No. 00-10, "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs." EITF
00-10 provides guidance on the financial reporting of shipping and handling fees
and costs in the consolidated statements of income. During 2001, the Company
adopted EITF 00-10 and, as a result, amounts billed to a customer in a sale
transaction related to shipping costs are reported as net sales and the related
costs incurred for shipping are reported as cost of goods sold. The Company
previously reported shipping costs as a reduction of net sales. Prior period
consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the new
requirements.

     In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations" and No.
142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 will require that the
purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001 and that the use of the pooling-of-interest method is no
longer allowed. SFAS No. 142 requires that upon adoption, amortization of
goodwill will cease and instead, the carrying value of goodwill will be
evaluated for impairment on an annual basis. Identifiable intangible assets will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of." The Company will adopt SFAS
No. 142 on August 1, 2001. At July 31, 2001, goodwill approximated $96,041,000.
The Company estimates that the adoption of SFAS No. 142 will add approximately
$0.26 annually to earnings per share.

3. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     The Company provides postretirement medical, dental and vision benefits for
all regular full and part-time domestic employees (including spouses) who retire
on or after attainment of age 55 with 15 years of credited service. Credited
service begins accruing at the later of age 40 or date of hire. All active
employees first eligible to retire after July 31, 1992, are covered by an
unfunded, contributory postretirement healthcare plan where employer
contributions will not exceed a Defined Dollar Benefit amount, regardless of the
cost of the program. Employer contributions to the plan are based on the
employee's age and service at retirement.

     The Company accounts for postretirement benefits other than pensions in
accordance with SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other than Pensions." The Company funds benefit costs on a pay-as-you-go basis.

     The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the Plan's

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost included the
  following components:
  Service cost -- benefits attributed to service during the
     period.................................................    $  469    $  444    $  472
  Prior service cost........................................        22        22        22

</Table>

     The assumed health care cost trend rates used in measuring the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at July 31, 2001 were 10% grading down 0.5%
per year to 5.5% at July 31, 2010.

     The weighted average discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 7.5% in 2001 and 8% in 2000.

     If the health care cost trend rate assumptions were increased by 1% or
decreased by 1%, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of July
31, 2001 would be increased by $35,400 and decreased by $35,400, respectively.
The effect of this change on the sum of the service cost and interest cost would
not be material.

     The Company has retirement and profit-sharing plans covering substantially
all full-time domestic employees and certain of its foreign subsidiaries.
Contributions to the plans are determined annually or quarterly, according to
the plan, based on earnings of the respective companies and employee
contributions. At July 31, 2001 and 2000, $2,040,000 and $2,196,000,
respectively, of accrued profit-sharing contributions were included in other
current liabilities.

     The Company also has deferred compensation plans for directors, officers
and key executives utilizing the phantom stock plan concept. At July 31, 2001
and 2000, $5,878,000 and $5,569,000, respectively, of deferred compensation was
included in current and other long-term liabilities.

     During fiscal 1998, the Company adopted a new deferred compensation plan
that invests solely in shares of the Company's Class A Nonvoting Common Stock.
Participants in the old phantom stock plan were allowed to convert their
balances in the old plan to this new plan. The new plan was funded initially by
the issuance of 372,728 shares of Class A Nonvoting Common Stock to a Rabbi
Trust. All deferrals into the new plan result in purchases of Class A Nonvoting
Common Stock by the Rabbi Trust. No deferrals are allowed into the old plan.
Shares held by the Rabbi Trust are distributed to participants upon separation
from the Company as defined in the plan agreement.

     The amounts charged to income for the plans described above were $7,515,000
in 2001, $7,736,000 in 2000 and $7,589,000 in 1999.

     The Company has a voluntary employee benefit trust for the purpose of
funding employee medical benefits and certain other employee benefits. At July
31, 2001 and 2000, $2,378,000 and $2,793,000, respectively, of payments to the
trust to fund such benefits were included in prepaid expenses and other current
assets.

     The Company's policy is to remit earnings from foreign subsidiaries only to
the extent any resultant foreign income taxes are creditable in the United
States. Accordingly, the Company does not currently provide for the additional
United States and foreign income taxes which would become payable upon remission
of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.

     The cumulative undistributed earnings of such companies at July 31, 2001
amounted to approximately $63,413,000. If all such undistributed earnings were
remitted, no additional provision for foreign income taxes would be required.

5. LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS

     On September 23, 1999, the Company entered into a $150,000,000
multicurrency revolving loan agreement with a group of six banks, which expires
on September 23, 2004. On January 31, 2000, the multicurrency revolving loan was
amended, increasing the amount available to $200,000,000. Under the agreement,
the Company has the option to elect to have interest rates determined based upon
the prime rate at PNC Bank N.A. plus margin or a LIBOR rate plus margin. A
commitment fee is payable on the unused amount of credit. The agreement requires
the Company to maintain certain financial covenants, the Company has obtained
waivers for instances of non-compliance through July 31, 2001. Future borrowings
could be limited by the Company's ability to maintain, waive or modify the
financial covenants.

     The Company's Nonqualified Stock Option Plans allow the granting of stock
options to various officers, directors and other employees of the Company at
prices equal to fair market value at the date of grant. The Company has reserved
1,500,000 and 2,125,000 shares of Class A Nonvoting Common Stock for issuance
under the 1989 and 1997 Plans, respectively. Options granted prior to 1992
become exercisable once the employees have been continuously employed for six
months after the grant date. Generally, options granted in 1992 and thereafter
will not be exercisable until one year after the date of grant, will be
exercisable thereafter to the extent of one-third per year and have a maximum
term of ten years.

     In October 1995, SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" was
issued. SFAS No. 123 establishes a fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based compensation; however, it allows entities to continue accounting for
employee stock-based compensation under the intrinsic value method prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees." SFAS No. 123 requires certain disclosures, including pro forma net
income and net income per share as if the fair value based accounting method had
been used for employee stock-based compensation cost. The Company has decided to
adopt SFAS No. 123 through disclosure with respect to employee stock-based
compensation.

     If the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost for the Stock
Option Plans based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those
plans, consistent with the method prescribed by SFAS

7. SEGMENT INFORMATION

     Brady Corporation's reportable segments are business units that are each
managed separately because they manufacture and/or distribute distinct products
using different processes or channels to market.

     Brady Corporation has three reportable segments: the Identification
Solutions & Specialty Tapes Group, the Graphics Group and the Direct Marketing
Group.

     The Identification Solutions & Specialty Tape Group consists of
Identification Solutions, Brady AIDC Software & Services, and Precision Die-cut
Products and Custom Coated Products. Identification Solutions develops,
manufactures and sells wire and cable markings, high performance labels,
printing systems, and packaged software mainly to the electrical, electronic,
telecommunications, automotive and general industrial markets. Brady AIDC
Software & Services is focused on the Automatic Identification and Data
Collection market and its solutions consist of high performance labels and
labeling systems tied together with barcode design and print software, data
collection equipment, inventory services, application engineering and
integration services. Precision Die-cut Products manufactures custom die-cut
parts and specialty tapes. Die cut materials are engineered to provide improved
functionality and easier assembly of electronic products such as phones, pagers
and disk drives. Specialty tapes are used by audio and video tape duplicators.
Custom Coated Products develops and coats specialty material on a wide variety
of substrates such as polyester, polyimide, cloth, metal and paper. Coatings
include custom adhesive systems as well as high-performance topcoatings. These
materials are sold in bulk form or as converted products through other Brady
units.

     The Graphics Group consists primarily of Signmark(R) and Varitronics.
Signmark(R) manufactures and sells signs, labels and devices to meet government
safety requirements; printers and accessories for do-it-yourself industrial
signage and labels; regulatory training programs and products; and barricade
tape, accident-prevention tags and other visual warning systems. Varitronics

chemical, electrical, transportation and other manufacturing markets as well as
government, education and construction markets are some of those served by this
group.

     The Direct Marketing Group engages in direct selling to end users via
direct-mail catalogs, telemarketing and the Internet. Its products include more
than 50,000 products including signs, property identification tags, hazardous
materials and regulatory training programs and products, and office accessories.
The Direct Marketing Group serves manufacturing markets as well as construction,
wholesale trade, finance, insurance, government, education and healthcare.

     The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on profit
or loss from operations before income taxes, not including administrative costs,
interest, amortization of goodwill, exchange gain or loss and nonrecurring
items. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The Company's
interior measure of profit or loss changed in fiscal 2001 to support the move to
a global process organization. This change excludes administrative expenses from
the segment's measure of profit or loss. The prior year has been reclassified to
reflect this change. Assets at corporate consist principally of cash, net
deferred income tax assets and property.

     Intersegment sales and transfers are recorded at cost plus a standard
percentage markup. Intercompany profit is eliminated in consolidation.

8. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

     Net income per Common Share is computed by dividing net income (after
deducting the applicable Preferred Stock dividends and preferential Class A
Common Stock dividends) by the weighted average Common Shares outstanding of
22,824,398 for 2001, 22,669,854 for 2000 and 22,537,393 for 1999. The
preferential dividend on the Class A Common Stock of $.0333 per share has been
added to the net income per Class A Common Share for all years presented.

     Options to purchase 95,050, 264,167 and 446,168 shares of Class A common
stock were not included in the computations of diluted net income per share for
the fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, because the option exercise
prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares and,
therefore, the effect would be antidilutive.

10. NONRECURRING AND ONE-TIME CHARGES

     In July 2001, the Company recorded a nonrecurring charge of $9,560,000
($5,879,000 after tax, $0.26 per share) in fiscal 2001 related primarily to
facilities consolidation in the United States and Europe and workforce
reductions in its operations around the world. The $9,560,000 charge includes a
provision for severance of approximately $5,700,000, write-off or impairment of
assets (primarily buildings) of approximately $2,750,000 and $1,110,000 of other
costs associated with the restructuring efforts. Other costs primarily include
lease cancellation costs associated with the facilities consolidation. The
workforce reduction of approximately 175 people was essentially completed in
August 2001. Total cash expenditures in connection with these actions will
approximate $6,800,000, of which, approximately $350,000 was paid prior to July
31, 2001. The cost savings resulting from this plan are expected to be
recognized beginning in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 1999 included a $611,000 credit for
adjusting the severance costs associated with a workforce reduction in 1998.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

     Each director who is also an employee of the Company receives no additional
compensation for service on the Board or on any committee of the Board.
Directors who are not also employees of the Company receive an annual retainer
of $20,000 plus $1,500 for each committee they chair and $1,250 plus expenses
for each meeting of the Board or any committee thereof which they attend and are
a member. Directors receive $750 for each meeting they attend of any committee
for which they are not a member.

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS

     In January, 2001, the Board approved new Change in Control Agreements for
certain of its executive officers including Mrs. Hudson, Messrs. Fisk,
Schroeder, Hawke and Jaehnert. The agreements call for payment of an amount
equal to three times the annual salary and bonus for Mrs. Hudson and two times
the annual salary and bonus for Messrs. Fisk, Schroeder, Hawke, and Jaehnert in
the event of termination or resignation upon a change of control. The agreements
also call for reimbursement of any excise taxes imposed

                                      III-6
<PAGE>

and up to $25,000 of attorney fees to enforce the executive's rights under the
agreement. Payments under the agreements will be spread over three years for
Mrs. Hudson and two years for Messrs. Fisk, Schroeder, Hawke and Jaehnert.

     In May 1997, the Company created a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
(SERP) for Mr. Fisk. The Plan calls for the Company to credit a deferred
compensation account with $200,000 on August 1 of each year beginning August 1,
1997, to and including August 1, 2001, provided Mr. Fisk is employed by the
Company as of each of those dates. Interest accrues on the balance in the
account at the prime rate in effect on August 1 of each year, but not less than
6% nor more than 10% per annum.

     The Company is required to pay Mr. Fisk the balance in the account over a
ten-year period beginning on August 1 of the year following his termination of
employment with the Company. The first payment, and the nine succeeding
payments, will equal one-tenth of the balance in the account. Succeeding
payments will include interest credited to the account in the interim. The
Company may make payments in some other manner provided the payments are neither
smaller nor extend beyond such ten year period.

     In fiscal 1994 the Company created a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
(SERP) for Mrs. Hudson. The stated amount of the Plan at January 1, 1999, was
$500,000. The Company credited a deferred compensation account with the net
present value of the stated amount in January 1994. The account is credited
annually with the current year's increase in the net present value calculation.
After January 1, 1999, interest accrues quarterly on the balance in the account
at the prime rate in effect at the end of each calendar quarter.

     The Company is required to pay Mrs. Hudson the balance in the account over
a ten-year period beginning January 2009. The first payment will be one-tenth of
the balance in the account; the second one-ninth; and so on.

     In the event of a change in control of the Company, Mrs. Hudson's SERP may
accelerate and become payable in 30 days.

RESTRICTED STOCK

     In August 1997, the Company granted restricted stock awards to certain key
executives. Mrs. Hudson was awarded 50,000 shares of authorized, but unissued,
Class A Common Stock and Messrs. Fisk, Schroeder and Hawke were awarded 25,000
shares each of authorized, but unissued Class A Common Stock. The restricted
stock awards granted Mrs. Hudson and Mr. Fisk vest on August 1, 2002. The
restricted stock awards granted Mr. Schroeder and Mr. Hawke vest 75% on August
1, 2002, with the remaining 25% vesting on August 1, 2003. The executives have
the right to receive any cash dividends payable on these shares.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     During fiscal 2001, the Board's Compensation Committee was composed of
Messrs. Bemis, Jarc and Peirce. Mr. Lettenberger serves as a nonvoting advisor
to the Committee. None of these persons has at any time been an employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries. There are no relationships among the
Company's executive officers, members of the Compensation Committee or entities
whose executives serve on the Board that require disclosure under applicable SEC
regulations.

MONEY PURCHASE AND 401(k) PLAN

     Substantially all Brady employees in the United States and certain
expatriate employees working for its international subsidiaries are eligible to
participate in the Company's Money Purchase ("Brady Corporation Funded
Retirement Plan") and Employee 401K Plan (the "Brady Corporation Matched 401(k)
Plan"). Under this plan the Company agrees to contribute certain amounts to the
Brady Corporation Matched 401(k) Plan. Under the Funded Retirement Plan, the
Company contributes 4% of the eligible earnings of each person covered by the
Funded Retirement Plan. In addition, participants may elect to have their annual
pay reduced by up to 4% and have the amount of this reduction contributed to the
Brady Corporation Matched 401(k) Plan by the Company and matched by an
additional, equal contribution by the Company. Participants may
                                      III-7
<PAGE>

also elect to have up to another 8% of their eligible earnings contributed to
the Brady Corporation Matched 401(k) Plan (without an additional matching
contribution by the Company). The assets of the Brady Corporation Matched 401(k)
Plan and Brady Corporation Funded Retirement Plan credited to each participant
are invested by the trustee of the Plans as directed in several investment funds
as permitted by the Brady Corporation Matched 401(k) Plan and Brady Corporation
Funded Retirement Plan. The annual contributions and forfeitures allocated to
any participant under all defined contribution plans may not exceed the lesser
of $30,000 or 25% of the participant's base compensation and bonuses. Benefits
are generally payable upon the death, disability, or retirement of the
participant or upon termination of employment before retirement, although
benefits may also be withdrawn from the Brady Corporation Matched 401(k) Plan
and paid to the participant if required for certain emergencies. Under certain
specified circumstances, the Brady Corporation Matched 401(k) Plan allows loans
to be drawn on a participant's account. The participant is immediately fully
vested with respect to the contributions attributable to reductions in pay; all
other contributions become fully vested after three years of service.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

     During fiscal 1998, the Company adopted new deferred compensation plans
whereby directors, executive officers, corporate staff officers and certain key
management employees of the Company are permitted to defer portions of their
fees, salary and bonus into a plan account, the value which is measured by the
Company's Class A Common Stock. Participants in the old deferred compensation
plan were allowed to convert their balances in the old plan to this new plan.
The conversion to the new plan was funded by the issuance of 372,728 shares of
Class A Common Stock to a Rabbi Trust (the "Trust") in November 1997. All
deferrals into the new plan result in purchases of existing Class A Common Stock
by the Trust. No deferrals are allowed into the old plan.

     Upon the retirement, disability, or death of participant, the Company is
required under the new plan to pay, each year for a period of ten years, a
portion of the shares held in the participant's name by the Trust. The first
payment must be one-tenth of the number of shares held; the second one-ninth;
and so on, with the number of shares held in the Trust reduced by each payment.

     If the participant's employment ends for reasons other than retirement,
disability or death, the shares held by the Trust in the participant's name will
be distributed over a period of ten years. At the request of the participant and
for special situations at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee, the
Company may make distributions in larger installments or in a lump sum or other
basis.

     In the old deferred compensation plan, directors, executive officers,
corporate staff officers and certain key management employees of the Company
were permitted to defer portions of their fees, salary and bonus into a plan,
the value of which was measured in "phantom stock" of the Company. "Phantom
Stock" is not actual stock or rights to acquire stock in the Company, but it
gives participants the right to share in increases in book value (as defined) of
the common stock. At the end of each fiscal year, the deferred compensation
balance (with interest) is credited to the purchase of phantom common stock at
the then book value of the common stock of the Company, and is thereafter
adjusted to reflect stock dividends and other dividends or distributions on the
Company's Class A Common Stock. No new deferrals are allowed into this old
deferred compensation plan. Upon the retirement, disability, or death of
participant, the Company is required to pay, each year for a period of ten
years, a portion of the book value of the phantom stock determined by the book
value of the corresponding number of common shares as of the end of each fiscal
year. The first payment must be one-tenth of the book value; the second
one-ninth; and so on, with the number of phantom shares reduced by the
equivalent in book value of each payment. At the request of the participant, the
Company may make payments in larger installments or in a lump sum on a
discounted or other basis.

     All current directors and executives converted their balances to the new
deferred compensation plan. Certain retired participants elected not to transfer
their balances into the new plan. They were allowed to remain in the old
deferred compensation plan until the end of fiscal 2002. At that point the old
plan will terminate and participant's balances will earn simple interest at a
rate equal to the yield on a 30-year U.S. Treasury Bond as of July 31 of each
year.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     The Company's Compensation Committee (the "Committee") is composed entirely
of outside directors and is responsible for considering and approving
compensation arrangements for senior management of the Company, including the
Company's executive officers and the chief executive officer. It is the
philosophy of the Committee to establish a total executive compensation program,
which is competitive with a broad range of companies that it considers to be of
comparable size and complexity.

     The primary components of the Company's executive compensation program are
(i) base salary, (ii) annual shareholder value enhancement plan cash bonuses and
(iii) long term incentive compensation in the form of stock options and/or
restricted stock. These are designed to align shareholder and management
interests, to balance the achievement of annual performance targets with actions
that focus on the long-term success of the Company, and to attract, motivate and
retain key executives who are important to the continued success of the Company.
Decisions made by the Committee relating to the base salary compensation of the
Chief Executive Officer are reviewed and approved by the full Board of
Directors.

     THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT:

     -- The Company's pay levels are appropriately targeted to attract and
        retain key executives;

     -- The Company's incentive plan provides strong incentives for management
        to increase shareholder value; and

     -- The Company's total executive compensation program is a cost-effective
        strategy to increase shareholder value.

  Base Salary

     Consistent with the Committee's philosophy, base salaries are generally
maintained at or modestly above competitive base salary levels. Competitive
salary level is defined as the average base salary for similar responsibilities
in a group of companies selected by the Committee that the Committee considers
to be of comparable size and complexity. In setting base salaries for fiscal
2001, the Committee reviewed compensation survey data and was satisfied that the
base salary levels set would achieve the Company's objectives. Specific
increases reflect the Committee's subjective evaluation of individual
performance.

  Annual Shareholder Value Enhancement Plan

     The shareholder value enhancement plan (the "Bonus Plan") provides for the
annual payment of cash bonuses. When viewed together with the Company's base
salary, the purpose of the Bonus Plan is to provide a balance between fixed
compensation and variable, results-oriented compensation. The Bonus Plan is 90%
objective. It stresses maximization of Company profitability and increasing
shareholder value.

  Stock Options

     In May 1997, the Company approved the Brady Corporation 1997 Omnibus
Incentive Stock Plan and the Brady Corporation 1997 Nonqualified Stock Option
Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Option Plans") under which 2,000,000
shares and 125,000 shares, respectively, of Class A Common Stock are available
for grant. In 1989 the Board approved the Brady Corporation 1989 Non-Qualified
Stock Option Plan (the "Option Plan") under which 1,500,000 shares of Class A
Common Stock were available for grant. The Option Plans assist directors,
executive officers, corporate staff officers and key management employees in
becoming shareholders with an important stake in the Company's future, aligning
their personal financial interest with that of all shareholders. Stock options
are typically granted annually and have a term of ten years. Generally, the
options become one-third exercisable one year after the date of the grant and
one-third additional in each of the succeeding two years so that at the end of
three years after the date of the grant they are fully exercisable. All grants
under the Option Plans are at market price on the date of the grant.

  Compliance with Tax Regulations Regarding Executive Compensation

     Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, added by the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993, generally disallows a tax deduction to public
companies for compensation over $1 million paid to the corporation's chief
executive officer and the other named executive officers. Qualifying
performance-based compensation will not be subject to the deduction limit if
certain requirements are met. The Company's executive compensation program, as
currently constructed, is not likely to generate nondeductible compensation in
excess of these limits. The Compensation Committee will continue to review these
tax regulations as they apply to the Company's executive compensation program.
It is the Compensation Committee's intent to preserve the deductibility of
executive compensation to the extent reasonably practicable and to the extent
consistent with its other compensation objectives.

  Compensation of the Chief Executive Officer

     Mrs. Hudson received $497,231 in base salary in fiscal 2001, an increase of
5.7% from the prior year's base salary. She was not paid a bonus attributable to
fiscal 2001, a decrease of 100%, or $535,963, from the prior year's bonus. The
bonus was determined in accordance with the Company's objective Bonus Plan,
discussed above. Mrs. Hudson's compensation reflects:

(i)     an increase of 13.2%, from $30.44 to $34.45, in the Company's stock
        price, a decrease of 26.9%, or $12,279,000, in profits (after removing
        the effects of the nonrecurring items) and a decrease 0.9% in sales over
        similar amounts from the prior year

(ii)    the successful acquisitions of Balkhausen GmbH and Eset, GmbH this year
        and the integration of last year's acquisitions of certain assets of
        Champion America, Inc., Data Recognition, Inc. and Imtec, Inc.

(iii)   continued improvement in asset utilization (a 10.5% decrease in
        inventory and accounts receivable)

(iv)    continued efforts to focus the Company's resources on sustainable
        value-enhancing long-term growth

(v)     continued improvement in intercompany teamwork.

     During fiscal 2001, Mrs. Hudson was awarded options to purchase 35,000
shares of Class A Common Stock.

     The Committee believes these awards are consistent with the objectives of
the various plans and with the overall compensation policy of the Board of
Directors.

                       * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

     The Compensation Committee believes the executive compensation programs and
practices described above are competitive. They are designed to provide
increased compensation with improved financial results and provide additional
opportunity for capital accumulation, but only if shareholder value is
increased.
