                                     Part I

Item 1. Business

General:

      Balchem Corporation (including, unless the context otherwise requires, BCP
Ingredients, "Balchem", or the "Company"), incorporated in the State of Maryland
in 1967, is engaged in the  development,  manufacture and marketing of specialty
performance   ingredients   and  products   for  the  food,   feed  and  medical
sterilization  industries.  The Company has three segments,  specialty products,
encapsulated  / nutritional  products and the  unencapsulated  feed  supplements
segment  also  referred  to in this  report  as BCP  Ingredients  ("BCP" or "BCP
Ingredients"). Products relating to choline animal feed for non-ruminant animals
are primarily reported in the  unencapsulated  feed supplements  segment.  Human
choline  nutrient  products  and  encapsulated  products  are  reported  in  the
encapsulated / nutritional products segment.

      References  in  this  Report  to  the  Company  mean  Balchem  and/or  its
subsidiary as the context requires.

      The Company  sells its products  through its own sales force,  independent
distributors and sales agents.  Financial  information  concerning the Company's
business and business segments appears in the Consolidated  Financial Statements
included  under  Item 8 herein,  which  information  is  incorporated  herein by
reference.

Encapsulated / Nutritional Products
-----------------------------------

      The encapsulated / nutritional products segment predominantly encapsulates
performance ingredients for use throughout the food and animal health industries
to enhance nutritional fortification,  processing, prepared foods and shelf-life
improvement.  Major end product  applications are baked goods,  refrigerated and
frozen dough systems,  processed meats, seasoning blends and confections.  Human
grade choline nutrient  products are also marketed through this industry segment
for  wellness  applications.  Choline  is  recognized  to play a key role in the
structural  integrity of cell membranes,  processing  dietary fat,  reproductive
development and neural functions, such as memory and muscle function.

      In the animal health industries,  Balchem markets REASHURE(TM) Choline, an
encapsulated   choline  product  that  boosts  health  and  milk  production  in
transition and early lactation cows. Commercial sales are currently derived from
the dairy industry where REASHURE(TM) delivers nutrient supplements that survive
the rumen and are biologically available,  providing required nutritional levels
to dairy cows during  certain weeks  preceding and following  calving,  commonly
referred to as the  "transition  period" of the animal.  Also marketed in animal
health is  NITROSHURE(TM),  an encapsulated  urea supplement for lactating dairy
cows.  It is designed to create a  slow-release  nitrogen  source for the rumen,
allowing for greater  flexibility  in feed rations for dairy  nutritionists  and
producers.

      In  2004,  this  segment  introduced  several  new  products  and  product
applications  that are being sold  commercially  for  enhancement of nutritional
value,  shelf-life and  fortification in certain food and animal health markets.
The Company also has a research and development pipeline of several new products
and product  applications for these markets in test production or test marketing
status.

Specialty Products
------------------

      The specialty  products  segment  repackages and distributes the following
specialty gases:  ethylene oxide, blends of ethylene oxide,  propylene oxide and
methyl chloride.


                                       1
<PAGE>

      Ethylene oxide,  at the 100% level, is sold as a sterilant gas,  primarily
for use in the health  care  industry.  It is used to  sterilize a wide range of
medical devices because of its versatility and effectiveness in treating hard or
soft  surfaces,  composites,  metals,  tubing and  different  types of  plastics
without  negatively  impacting the performance or appearance of the device being
sterilized.  The Company's  100% ethylene  oxide product is  distributed  by the
Company in, uniquely designed, recyclable double-walled stainless steel drums to
assure compliance with safety,  quality and environmental  standards as outlined
by the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency (the "EPA") and the U.S. Department
of Transportation. The Company's inventory of these specially built drums, along
with the Company's  three filling  facilities,  represent a significant  capital
investment. Contract sterilizers,  medical device manufacturers, and medical gas
distributors  are the  Company's  principal  customers  for this  product.  As a
fumigant, ethylene oxide blends are highly effective in killing bacteria, fungi,
and insects in spices and other seasoning  materials.  In addition,  the Company
also sells  single use  canisters  with 100%  ethylene  oxide for use in medical
device sterilization.

      Due to  consolidation  of customer  businesses in the contract  sterilizer
industry,  the Company has one Specialty Products customer,  Sterigenics,  which
accounted for  approximately  11% and 10% of the Company's net sales in 2004 and
2003,  respectively.  This  customer  accounted for 10% and 12% of the Company's
accounts  receivable,  net balance at December 31, 2004 and 2003,  respectively.
The loss of such customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

      Two  other  products,  propylene  oxide  and  methyl  chloride,  are  sold
principally to customers  seeking smaller (as opposed to bulk)  quantities whose
requirements include timely delivery and safe handling.  Propylene oxide is used
for   fumigation  in  spice   treatment  and  in  various   chemical   synthesis
applications.  It is also  utilized in  manufacturing  operations to make paints
more durable,  and for  manufacturing  specialty  starches and textile coatings.
Methyl chloride is used as a raw material in specialty  herbicides,  fertilizers
and pharmaceuticals, as well as in malt and wine preservers.

BCP Ingredients
---------------

      The  unencapsulated  feed  supplements  segment  is  in  the  business  of
manufacturing and supplying choline chloride,  an essential  nutrient for animal
health,  predominantly to the poultry and swine industries.  Choline,  a vitamin
B-complex,  plays a vital role in the  metabolism  of fat and the  building  and
maintaining of cell  structures.  Choline  deficiency can result in, among other
symptoms,  reduced  growth  and  perosis in  poultry,  and fatty  liver,  kidney
necrosis  and general  poor health  condition  in swine.  In  addition,  certain
derivatives of choline  chloride are also  manufactured and sold into industrial
applications.  Choline  chloride is manufactured and sold in both an aqueous and
dry  form  and is sold  through  the  Company's  own  sales  force,  independent
distributors and sales agents.

Raw materials:
--------------

      The raw  materials  utilized  by the  Company  in the  manufacture  of its
products  are  generally  available  from a number of  commercial  sources.  The
Company is not experiencing any current difficulties in procuring such materials
and does not anticipate any such  problems;  however,  the Company cannot assure
that will always be the case.

Patents/Licensing:
------------------

      The  Company  currently  holds  a  number  of  patents  and  uses  certain
trade-names and trademarks. It also uses know-how, trade secrets,  formulae, and
manufacturing  techniques  that assist in maintaining  competitive  positions of
certain of its products.  Formulae and know-how are of particular  importance in
the manufacture of a number of the Company's products. The Company believes that
certain of its patents,  in the  aggregate,  are  advantageous  to its business.
However,  it is believed  that no single  patent or related  group of patents is
currently  material  to the  Company  as a  whole  and,  accordingly,  that  the
expiration or


                                       2
<PAGE>

termination  thereof  would not  materially  affect its  business.  The  Company
believes that its sales and  competitive  position are dependent  primarily upon
the quality of its products,  its technical sales efforts and market conditions,
rather than on any patent protection.

      As discussed below under "Environmental  Matters" the Company's ability to
sell ethylene oxide is dependent upon maintaining registration with the EPA as a
medical  device  sterilant  and spice  fumigant.  In  addition,  certain  of the
Company's   encapsulated   and  choline   products  must  meet  state  licensing
requirements prior to sales in certain states and foreign countries.

Seasonality:
------------

      In general,  the business of the Company's segments is not seasonal to any
material extent.

Backlog:
--------

      At  December  31,  2004,  the Company  had a total  backlog of  $2,027,000
(including  $807,000  for  the  encapsulated  /  nutritional  products  segment,
$812,000 for the specialty  products segment and $408,000 for BCP  Ingredients),
as compared to a total  backlog of  $1,881,000  at December 31, 2003  (including
$639,000 for the encapsulated / nutritional  products segment,  $891,000 for the
specialty products segment and $351,000 for the BCP Ingredients segment). It has
generally  been the  Company's  policy and  practice to maintain an inventory of
finished  products or component  materials for its segments to enable it to ship
products within a short time after receipt of a product order.

Competition:
------------

      The Company's competitors include many large and small companies,  some of
which have greater  financial,  research and  development,  production and other
resources than the Company.  Competition in the encapsulation  markets served by
the  Company is based  primarily  on  performance,  customer  support,  quality,
service and price. The development of new and improved  products is important to
the  Company's  success.  This  competitive   environment  requires  substantial
investments in product and  manufacturing  process research and development.  In
addition,  the winning and  retention of customer  acceptance  of the  Company's
encapsulated  products involve substantial  expenditures for application testing
and sales efforts.  The Company also engages  various  universities to assist in
research and provide independent third-party analysis. In the specialty products
business,   the  Company  faces   competition   from   alternative   sterilizing
technologies and products.  Competition in the animal feed markets served by the
Company is based primarily on service and price.

Research & Development:
-----------------------

      During the years  ended  December  31,  2004,  2003 and 2002,  the Company
incurred research and development  expense of approximately  $1.8 million,  $2.1
million  and $1.9  million,  respectively,  on  Company-sponsored  research  and
development  for  new  products  and  improvements  to  existing   products  and
manufacturing processes,  principally in the encapsulated / nutritional products
segment.  During the year ended  December 31,  2004,  an average of 15 employees
were devoted full time to research and development  activities.  The Company has
historically  funded its research and development  programs with funds available
from current  operations with the intent of recovering  those costs from profits
derived  from  future  sales of products  resulting  from,  or enhanced  by, the
research and development effort.

      The Company prioritizes its product development activities in an effort to
allocate its resources to those  product  candidates  that the Company  believes
have the greatest  commercial  potential.  Factors  considered by the Company in
determining the products to pursue include projected  markets and needs,  status
of its proprietary  rights,  technical  feasibility,  expected and known product
attributes, and estimated costs to bring the product to market.


                                       3

Capital Projects:
-----------------

      Capital expenditures were approximately $1.2 million for 2004. The capital
expenditures in 2003 of $2.3 million included construction costs associated with
the completion of a  state-of-the-art  canister  filling  operation at its Green
Pond,  South Carolina plant site. This automated  facility has been designed and
constructed  to fill single use canisters with ethylene oxide for use in medical
device  sterilization.  Capital  expenditures  are projected to be approximately
$1.7 million for calendar year 2005.

Environmental / Regulatory Matters:
-----------------------------------

      The Federal  Insecticide,  Fungicide and  Rodenticide  Act  ("FIFRA"),  as
amended, a health and safety statute,  requires that certain products within the
Company's  specialty  products  segment must be registered  with the EPA because
they are considered pesticides. In order to obtain a registration,  an applicant
typically must demonstrate through extensive test data that its product will not
cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.  The Company holds an EPA
registration  to permit it to sell ethylene oxide as a medical device  sterilant
and spice fumigant. The Company is in the process of re-registering this product
use, complying with FIFRA  re-registration  requirements of this product and all
products that are used as pesticides. The Company, in conjunction with one other
company,  has  conducted  the required  testing  under the direction of the EPA.
Testing has concluded and the EPA has stated that, due to a backlog of projects,
it cannot anticipate a date for completing the re-registration  process for this
product at this time. The Company's  management  continues to believe it will be
successful in obtaining re-registration for this product as it has met the EPA's
requirements  thus far.  Additionally,  the product is used as a sterilant  with
certain  qualities  and  no  known,  equally  effective  substitute.  Management
believes  absence of availability of this product could not be easily  tolerated
by various medical device  manufacturers and the health care industry due to the
resultant  infection  potential  if the product  were  unavailable.  The Company
intends to  recover  the cost of  re-registration  in the  selling  price of the
sterilant.

      Under   California's   Proposition  65  (Safe  Drinking  Water  and  Toxic
Enforcement  Act of 1986),  100%  ethylene  oxide,  when used as a sterilant  or
fumigant,  is listed by the State of California as a carcinogen and reproductive
toxin. As a result,  the Company is required to provide a prescribed  warning to
any person in California  who may be exposed to this  product;  failure to do so
would result in liability of up to $2,500 per day per person exposed.

      The Company's Verona facility, while held by a prior owner, was designated
by the EPA as a Superfund  site and placed on the  National  Priorities  List in
1983,  because of dioxin  contamination  on  portions  of the site.  Remediation
conducted  by the prior owner under the  oversight  of the EPA and the  Missouri
Department of Natural Resources ("MDNR") included removal of dioxin contaminated
soil  and  equipment,  capping  of  areas  of  residual  contamination  in  four
relatively small areas of the site separate from the  manufacturing  facilities,
and  the  installation  of  wells  to  monitor  groundwater  and  surface  water
contamination  for certain organic  chemicals.  No ground water or surface water
treatment was required.  The Company  believes that  remediation  of the site is
complete.  In 1998, the EPA certified the work on the  contaminated  soils to be
complete.  In February  2000,  after the  conclusion  of two years of monitoring
groundwater  and surface water,  the former owner  submitted a draft third party
risk assessment report to the EPA and MDNR  recommending no further action.  The
prior  owner is  awaiting  the  response  of the EPA and MDNR to the draft  risk
assessment.

      While the Company must  maintain the  integrity of the capped areas in the
remediation  areas on the site, the prior owner is responsible for completion of
any further  Superfund  remedy.  The Company is indemnified by the sellers under
its May 2001 asset  purchase  agreement  covering its  acquisition of the Verona
facility for potential liabilities associated with the Superfund site and one of
the sellers, in turn, has the benefit of certain contractual  indemnification by
the prior owner that implemented the above-described Superfund remedy.


                                       4
<PAGE>

      In connection with normal operations at its plant facilities,  the Company
is required to maintain environmental and other permits including those relating
to ethylene oxide operations.

      The Company  believes it is in  compliance  in all material  respects with
federal,  state,  and  local  provisions  that  have  been  enacted  or  adopted
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating
to the protection of the environment.  Such compliance  includes the maintenance
of  required  permits  under  air  pollution  regulations  and  compliance  with
requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration.  The cost of
such  compliance has not had a material effect upon the results of operations or
financial condition of the Company. The New York State environmental  regulatory
proceeding referred to in Item 3 below has been substantially completed.

Employees:
----------

      As of March 1, 2005,  the  Company  employed  approximately  200  persons.
Approximately  50  employees  at the  Company's  Verona,  Missouri  facility are
covered by a collective bargaining agreement which expires in 2007.

Certain Factors Affecting Future Operating Results:
---------------------------------------------------

      This Report contains  "forward-looking  statements"  within the meaning of
Section 21E of the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  which reflect
the Company's  expectation or belief concerning future events that involve risks
and  uncertainties.  The Company can give no  assurances  that the  expectations
reflected in  forward-looking  statements will prove correct and various factors
could  cause  results  to differ  materially  from the  Company's  expectations.
Certain factors that might cause such a difference include,  without limitation;
(1) changes in the laws or regulations  affecting the operations of the Company;
(2)  changes  in  the  business  tactics  or  strategies  of  the  Company;  (3)
acquisition(s) of assets or of new or complementary  operations,  or divestiture
of any segment of the existing  operations of the Company;  (4) changing  market
forces or contingencies that necessitate,  in management's judgment,  changes in
plans,  strategy  or  tactics  of  the  Company;  and  (5)  fluctuations  in the
investment  markets  or  interest  rates,  which  might  materially  affect  the
operations  or  financial  condition of the  Company,  as well as the  following
matters,  and all forward-looking  statements are qualified in their entirety by
these cautionary statements:

      Competition. The Company faces competition in its markets from a number of
large and small companies,  some of which have greater  financial,  research and
development,  production  and other  resources  than the Company.  The Company's
competitive  position is based  principally on  performance,  quality,  customer
support, service, breadth of product line, manufacturing or packaging technology
and the selling  prices of its products.  As in most  industries,  the Company's
competitors  can be  expected  to improve  the design and  performance  of their
products and to introduce new products with  competitive  price and  performance
characteristics. There can be no assurance that the Company will have sufficient
resources to maintain its current competitive position or market share.

      Environmental and Regulatory Matters. Pursuant to applicable environmental
and safety laws and regulations,  the Company is required to obtain and maintain
certain  governmental  permits and approvals,  including an EPA registration for
its ethylene oxide  sterilant  product.  Permits and approvals may be subject to
revocation,  modification  or  denial  under  certain  circumstances.  While the
Company believes it is in compliance in all material respects with environmental
laws,  there can be no assurance  that  operations  or activities of the Company
(including  the status of compliance  by the prior owner of the Verona  facility
under  Superfund  remediation)  will not  result in  administrative  or  private
actions,  revocation  of required  permits or licenses,  or fines,  penalties or
damages,  which could have an adverse  effect on the Company.  In addition,  the
Company  cannot  predict the extent to which any  legislation  or regulation may
affect the market for the Company's products or its cost of doing business.


                                       5
<PAGE>

      Raw  Materials.  The principal  raw  materials  used by the Company in the
manufacture  of its  products  can be subject to price  fluctuations.  While the
selling prices of the Company's  products tend to increase or decrease over time
with the cost of raw materials,  such changes may not occur simultaneously or to
the same degree. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to pass
increases in raw material  costs  through to its  customers in the form of price
increases.  Increases  in the price of raw  materials,  if not offset by product
price  increases,  could have an adverse  impact upon the  profitability  of the
Company. In addition,  the Company is not experiencing any current  difficulties
in procuring such materials and does not anticipate any such problems.  However,
the Company cannot assure that this will always be the case.

      Reliance on Continued  Operation  and  Sufficiency  of  Facilities  and on
Unpatented Trade Secrets.  The Company's revenues are dependent on the continued
operation  of its  manufacturing,  packaging,  and  processing  facilities.  The
operation of the Company's  facilities involves risks,  including the breakdown,
failure, or substandard  performance of equipment,  power outages,  the improper
installation,  or operation of equipment,  explosions,  fires, natural disasters
and the need to comply with  environmental  and other directives of governmental
agencies.  The occurrence of material  operational  problems,  including but not
limited to the above  events,  may  adversely  affect the  profitability  of the
Company  during  the  period of such  operational  difficulties.  The  Company's
competitive position is also dependent upon unpatented trade secrets.  There can
be no  assurance  that  others  will  not  independently  develop  substantially
equivalent proprietary information.

      Risks Associated with Foreign Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
approximately  8% of the  Company's  net sales  consisted  of sales  outside the
United  States,  predominately  to  Europe,  Japan and  Mexico.  Such  sales are
generally  denominated in U.S. Dollars at a specific price per unit.  Changes in
the relative  values of currencies take place from time to time and could in the
future  adversely  affect  prices  for  the  Company's  products.  In  addition,
international  sales are subject to other  inherent  risks,  including  possible
labor unrest,  political instability and export duties, and quotas. There can be
no assurance  that these factors will not have a material  adverse impact on the
Company's ability to increase or maintain its international sales.

      Dependence on Key Personnel. The Company's operations are dependent on the
continued efforts of its senior executives.  The loss of the services of certain
executives for an extended  period of time could have a material  adverse effect
on the Company.

Slate Hill, New York. The Company owns a total of approximately 16 acres of land
on two parcels in this community.

<PAGE>

      The  Company  also owns a  facility  located on an  approximately  24 acre
parcel of land in Green Pond,  South  Carolina.  The site consists of a drumming
facility,  a canister  filling  facility,  a maintenance  building and an office
building.  The Company uses this site for  processing  products in its specialty
products segment.

      The Verona,  Missouri site, which is located on  approximately  100 acres,
consists of  manufacturing  facilities  relating to choline  animal feed,  human
choline  nutrients,  and a drumming  facility for the Company's  ethylene  oxide
business,  together with buildings  utilized for warehousing such products.  The
facility,  while under prior ownership, was designated by the EPA as a Superfund
site as noted in the previous discussion under Item 1  "Environmental/Regulatory
Matters."

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

      In 1982 the Company  discovered and thereafter  removed a number of buried
drums  containing  unidentified  waste material from the Company's site in Slate
Hill, New York. The Company thereafter entered into a Consent Decree to evaluate
the drum  site  with  the New  York  Department  of  Environmental  Conservation
("NYDEC")  and  performed  a Remedial  Investigation/Feasibility  Study that was
approved by NYDEC in February  1994.  Based on NYDEC  requirements,  the Company
cleaned the area and removed additional soil from the drum burial site. The cost
for this clean-up and the related reports was approximately  $164,000.  Clean-up
was  completed  in 1996,  but NYDEC  required  the  Company to monitor  the site
through 1999. The Company  continues to be involved in discussions with NYDEC to
evaluate test results and determine  what,  if any,  additional  actions will be
required on the part of the Company to close out the  remediation  of this site.
Additional  actions,  if any,  would  likely  require  the  Company to  continue
monitoring  the site.  The cost of such  monitoring  has recently been less than
$5,000 per year.

      Casey  Liesse,  et al., v. AGA AB, et al.,  Circuit  Court of Cook County,
Illinois,  Case  No.  02 L  000498,  was  commenced  in  2002  against  over  80
defendants,  among  which is the  Company.  The  action  alleges  that  nineteen
individual  plaintiffs  were exposed to ethylene oxide and other  chemicals used
for sterilizing or cleaning  medical  instruments  during their  employment at a
hospital  in  Harvey,  Illinois.  As a  result  of  the  alleged  exposure,  the
plaintiffs claim they have suffered various physical and psychological injuries.
During the time period plaintiffs  suffered their alleged injuries,  the Company
was in the business of repackaging and distributing  ethylene oxide, among other
products. The Company never sold any product to the hospital but has been joined
due  to  the  fact  that  it  distributed  ethylene  oxide  for  medical  device
sterilization  to other  companies  that blend  ethylene  oxide for sales to the
hospital noted. The litigation is currently in the early stages of discovery and
various  insurance  companies have been notified of the claim. As a result,  the
Company is unable to predict the outcome of this litigation.

      The Company is also involved in other legal proceedings through the normal
course of business.  Management believes that any unfavorable outcome related to
these  proceedings  will not have a material  effect on the Company's  financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

      No matters were submitted to a vote of security  holders during the fourth
quarter of 2004.

PART II

Item 5.  Market  for the  Registrant's  Common  Equity and  Related  Stockholder
Matters

      (a)   Market Information.

      On December  16, 2004,  the Board of  Directors of the Company  approved a
three-for-two  split of the Company's common stock to be effected in the form of
a stock  dividend to  shareholders  of record on December 30,  2004.  Such stock
dividend was made on January 20, 2005. Accordingly, the stock split was


                                       7
<PAGE>

recognized by  reclassifying  the par value of the additional  shares  resulting
from the split, from additional  paid-in capital to common stock. All references
to number of common shares and per share amounts except shares authorized in the
accompanying  consolidated  financial statements were retroactively  adjusted to
reflect the effect of the stock split.

      The Company's  common stock is traded on the American Stock Exchange under
the symbol BCP. The high and low closing prices for the common stock as recorded
in the American Stock Exchange Market Statistical Reports for 2004 and 2003, for
each quarterly period during the past two years,  adjusted for the December 2004
three-for-two  stock  split  (effected  by  means of a stock  dividend)  were as
follows:

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

      This Report  contains  forward-looking  statements,  within the meaning of
Section 21E of the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  which reflect
the Company's  expectation or belief concerning future events that involve risks
and  uncertainties.  The actions and  performance  of the Company  could  differ
materially from what is contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained
in this Report.  Factors that might cause  differences from the  forward-looking
statements  include those  referred to or identified in Item 1 above.  Reference
should be made to such factors and all forward-looking  statements are qualified
in their entirety by the above cautionary statements.

                              RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
                              ---------------------

      Overview
      --------

      The Company  develops,  manufactures,  distributes  and markets  specialty
performance   ingredients   and  products   for  the  food,   feed  and  medical
sterilization  industries.  The  Company's  reportable  segments  are  strategic
businesses  that offer products and services to different  markets.  The Company
presently has three  reportable  segments,  specialty  products,  encapsulated /
nutritional products and BCP Ingredients.

      Specialty Products Segment
      --------------------------

      The specialty  products  segment  repackages and distributes the following
specialty gases:  ethylene oxide, blends of ethylene oxide,  propylene oxide and
methyl chloride.

      Ethylene oxide,  at the 100% level,  is sold as a chemical  sterilant gas,
primarily for use in the health care  industry and is used to sterilize  medical
devices.  Contract  sterilizers,  medical device  manufacturers  and medical gas
distributors are the Company's principal  customers for this product.  Blends of
ethylene  oxide  are sold as  fumigants  and are  highly  effective  in  killing
bacteria,  fungi,  and insects in spices and other seasoning type materials.  In
addition,  the Company also sells single use canisters  with 100% ethylene oxide
for use in medical device sterilization. Propylene oxide and methyl chloride are
sold principally to customers seeking smaller (as opposed to bulk) quantities.

      Management  believes  that  future  success  in  this  segment  is  highly
dependent  on the  Company's  ability  to  maintain  its strong  reputation  for
excellent quality, safety and customer service.

      Encapsulated / Nutritional Products
      -----------------------------------

      The encapsulated / nutritional products segment predominantly encapsulates
performance ingredients for use throughout the food and animal health industries
to  enhance  nutritional  fortification,  prepared  food  processing,  packaging
applications  and shelf-life  improvement.  Major end product  applications  are
baked goods,  refrigerated and frozen dough systems,  processed meats, seasoning
blends and confections.

      Management  believes this  segment's  key  strengths  are its  proprietary
technology  and  end-product  application  capabilities.   The  success  of  the
Company's efforts to increase revenue in this segment is highly dependent on the
timing of marketing  launches of new products in the U.S. and international food
market by the  Company's  customers  and  prospects.  The  Company,  through its
innovative  proprietary  technology  and  applications  expertise,  continues to
develop  new  microencapsulation  products  designed  to solve  and  respond  to
customer  problems  and  needs.  Sales of our  REASHURE(TM)  and  NITROSHURE(TM)
products for the animal  nutrition and health  industry are highly  dependent on
dairy  industry  economics as well as the ability of the Company to leverage the
results of existing successful university research on the animal health benefits
of this product.


                                       10
<PAGE>

      BCP Ingredients
      ---------------

      BCP Ingredients  manufactures and supplies choline chloride,  an essential
nutrient for animal health,  to the poultry and swine  industries.  In addition,
certain  derivatives  of choline  chloride  are also  marketed  into  industrial
applications.

      Management believes that success in this commodity-oriented marketplace is
highly dependent on the Company's  ability to maintain its strong reputation for
excellent  product quality and customer service.  In addition,  the Company must
continue to increase  production  efficiencies in order to maintain its low-cost
position  to  effectively  compete  for  market  share in a  highly  competitive
marketplace.

      The Company sells  products for all three  segments  through its own sales
force, independent distributors, and sales agents.

      The  following  tables  summarize  consolidated  net sales by segment  and
business  segment  earnings  (loss) for the three  years  ended  December 31 (in
thousands):

      Fiscal Year 2004 compared to Fiscal Year 2003


                                       11
<PAGE>

      Net Sales
      ---------

      Net  sales  for 2004 were  $67,406  compared  with  $61,875  for 2003,  an
increase of $5,531 or 8.9%.  Net sales for the specialty  products  segment were
$28,767 for 2004  compared  with $26,163 for 2003, an increase of $2,604 or 10%.
This increase was due principally to greater sales volumes of ethylene oxide for
medical device contractor  sterilization and single use ethylene oxide canisters
for use in sterilization equipment. Net sales for the encapsulated / nutritional
products  segment  were  $24,759 for 2004  compared  with  $24,043 for 2003,  an
increase of $716 or 3%, led by volume  improvements  in the domestic food market
as well as increasing  dairy industry  acceptance of NITROSHURE  (TM),  which we
launched in the first  quarter of 2004.  Sales in this segment  were  negatively
affected by competitive  pressures in the human food and nutrition markets which
resulted in lower  average  selling  prices as  compared to the prior year.  Net
sales of $13,880 were realized for 2004 in the BCP Ingredients  segment compared
with  $11,669 for 2003,  an increase of $2,211 or 18.9%.  This  increase was due
principally  to increased  volumes  sold in the aqueous and dry choline  product
lines, along with some very modest price increases in both product lines.

      Gross Margin
      ------------

      Gross margin for 2004  increased to $23,806  compared to $21,152 for 2003.
Gross margin as a percentage  of net sales for 2004 was 35.3%  compared to 34.2%
for 2003.  Although  sales  volumes  and gross  margin  have  increased  in 2004
compared  to the  comparable  prior  year  period,  our  margins,  in all  three
segments,  were  unfavorably  impacted by rising raw material and energy  costs.
Gross margin  percentage for the specialty  products  segment was 50.9% for 2004
compared to 50.1% for 2003.  Margins for the specialty products segment improved
due principally to increased  sales volume of packaged  ethylene oxide and sales
of single use ethylene oxide  canisters for use in medical device  sterilization
and lower  amortization  expense.  Gross margin percentage in the encapsulated /
nutritional  products  segment  was 31.0% for 2004  compared  to 29.6% for 2003.
Margins were favorably  impacted by increased  sales volume to the domestic food
market.  Margins in the encapsulated / nutritional products segment in 2003 were
unfavorably   affected  by  a  designed  reduction  in  inventory  levels  which
negatively  impacted the Company's  gross  margins due to the  resulting  excess
plant manufacturing capacity. As noted above, during 2004, increased competition
in both the human food and nutrition  markets  resulted in lower average selling
prices which  partially  offset  improvements in profit margins for this segment
during 2004.  Margins for BCP Ingredients  were favorably  affected by increased
production  volumes of choline  chloride  and  choline  derivative  products  in
addition to the modest price increases noted above.

      Operating Expenses
      ------------------

      Operating  expenses for 2004  declined to $11,009 from $12,137 for 2003, a
decrease of $1,128 or 9.3%.  Total  operating  expenses as a percentage of sales
were 16.3% for 2004 compared to 19.6% for 2003.  This decrease was principally a
result of a decrease in selling,  marketing and research  expenses,  a result of
the Company having made several  organizational  and business changes  affecting
the  encapsulated  / nutritional  products  segment.  Many of these changes were
effected  late in the  fourth  quarter  of  2003 in an  effort  to  refocus  our
commercial efforts,  reduce operating expenses and improve the overall financial
performance of this segment.  These decreases were partially offset by increased
charges for search fees associated with new hires and higher  professional  fees
including those required to comply with the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002. During
2004  and  2003,  the  Company  spent  $1,752  and  $2,083,   respectively,   on
Company-sponsored research and development programs,  substantially all of which
pertained to the Company's  encapsulated / nutritional products segment for both
food and animal health applications.

      Earnings From Operations
      ------------------------

      As a result  of the  foregoing,  earnings  from  operations  for 2004 were
$12,797 compared to $9,015 for 2003, reflecting a 42.0% increase year over year.

      Other expenses (income)
      -----------------------


                                       12
<PAGE>

      Interest  expense  for 2004  totaled  $219  compared  to $272 for 2003,  a
decrease  of $53.  This  decrease  is the  result of lower  average  outstanding
borrowings during the period.  Interest income for 2004 totaled $125 compared to
$20 for 2003. This increase is the result of higher average cash balances during
the period.

      Income Tax Expense
      ------------------

      The  Company's  effective  tax rate in 2004 was 36.9%  compared to a 35.7%
rate for 2003.

      Net earnings
      ------------

      As a result of the  foregoing,  net earnings were $8,026 for 2004 compared
with $5,638 for 2003, reflecting a 42.4% increase year over year..

      Fiscal Year 2003 compared to Fiscal Year 2002

      Net Sales
      ---------

      Net  sales  for 2003 were  $61,875  compared  with  $60,197  for 2002,  an
increase of $1,678 or 2.8%.  Net sales for the specialty  products  segment were
$26,163 for 2003 compared with $22,028 for 2002, an increase of $4,135 or 18.8%.
This increase was due principally to greater sales volumes (11.8% over the prior
comparable period) of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization and single
use ethylene oxide  canisters (new business for 2003) for  sterilization  use in
medical facilities.  Propylene oxide volume also increased in 2003 by 20.3%. Net
sales for the encapsulated / nutritional  products segment were $24,043 for 2003
compared  with  $27,990 for 2002, a decrease of $3,947 or 14.1%.  Of  particular
significance,  the prior year  comparable  period  included  substantial  sales,
approximately  $2,200,  to a single  domestic  food customer in support of a new
product launch.  While this customer's end consumer  product  continues to be in
distribution, the Company did not realize any sales to this customer in 2003 due
to slower than expected market acceptance of the new end-product.  The remaining
decrease was largely a result of unfavorable product mix and a volume decline in
sales to the domestic food market. The Company experienced conservative customer
purchasing  patterns and delayed new product launches by customers in the United
States.  Net sales of  $11,669  were  realized  for 2003 in the BCP  Ingredients
(unencapsulated feed supplements)  segment,  which markets choline additives for
the  poultry  and swine  industries  as well as  industrial  choline  derivative
products,  compared with $10,179 for 2002,  an increase of $1,490 or 14.6%.  The
increase was primarily a result of increased  volumes sold (14.4% over the prior
comparable period) in the choline chloride and specialty derivative markets.

      Gross Margin
      ------------

      Gross  margin  percentage  for 2003 was 34.2%  compared to 38.7% for 2002.
Margins for the specialty  products segment were favorably affected by increased
production volumes of the Company's  products utilizing ethylene oxide.  Margins
in the encapsulated / nutritional  products segment were unfavorably affected by
the decline in sales  volume as  described  above.  These  lower  sales  levels,
coupled  with  a  designed  reduction  in  inventory  levels  in  this  segment,
negatively  impacted the Company's  gross  margins due to the  resulting  excess
plant manufacturing  capacity.  In addition,  increased  competition in both the
Domestic and  International  food markets during the fourth quarter  resulted in
lower volumes sold and lower average  selling  prices which  contributed  to the
erosion in profit  margins for this segment.  Margins for BCP  Ingredients  were
favorably  affected by  increased  production  volumes of choline  chloride  and
specialty  derivative  products.  The decision to reduce  inventory levels while
maintaining prior levels of plant  manufacturing  capacity in the encapsulated /
nutritional products segment,  generated  unfavorable  manufacturing  variances.
However,  such decision  contributed  greatly toward an improved cash balance at
December 31, 2003. Increases in employee medical claims under our self-insurance
program, as well as


                                       13
<PAGE>

increases in the Company's plant and other insurance premiums due to unfavorable
insurance  marketplace  conditions,  had a negative  impact on  margins  for all
segments.

      Operating Expenses
      ------------------

      Operating expenses for 2003 increased to $12,137 from $11,125 for 2002, an
increase of $1,012 or 9.1%.  Total  operating  expenses as a percentage of sales
were 19.6% for 2003 compared to 18.5% for 2002.  Increases in general  insurance
and medical costs as described above, and advertising costs for the encapsulated
/ nutritional  products  segment,  were largely  responsible for the increase in
operating expenses. In addition, operating expenses for 2003 include a charge of
approximately $400, resulting from the Company making organizational  changes in
the  encapsulated/nutritional  products  segment.  These personnel  changes were
effected  late in the  fourth  quarter  of  2003 in an  effort  to  refocus  our
commercial efforts,  reduce operating expenses and improve the overall financial
performance of the encapsulated / nutritional products segment.  During 2003 and
2002, the Company spent $2,083 and $1,907,  respectively,  on  Company-sponsored
research and development  programs,  substantially all of which pertained to the
Company's  encapsulated / nutritional  products segment for both food and animal
feed applications.

      Earnings From Operations
      ------------------------

      As a result  of the  foregoing,  earnings  from  operations  for 2003 were
$9,015 compared to $12,185 for 2002.  Earnings from operations for the specialty
products  segment  for 2003 were $9,409  compared to $7,240 for 2002.  Loss from
operations for the encapsulated / nutritional products segment for 2003 was $962
compared to earnings of $5,118 for 2002.  Earnings from the unencapsulated  feed
supplements segment for 2003 were $568 compared to a loss of $173 for 2002.

      Other expenses (income)
      -----------------------

      Interest  expense  for 2003  totaled  $272  compared  to $389 for 2002,  a
decrease  of $117.  This  decrease  is the result of lower  average  outstanding
borrowings during the period combined with lower average interest rates.

      Income Tax Expense
      ------------------

      The Company's  effective tax rate for 2003 was 35.7%  compared to 37.4% in
2002  primarily due to a favorable  shift in the mix of taxable  income to lower
state tax rate jurisdictions.

      Net earnings
      ------------

      As a result of the  foregoing,  net earnings were $5,638 for 2003 compared
with $7,416 for 2002.

      Contractual Obligations
      -----------------------

      The Company's contractual  obligations and commitments principally include
obligations  associated  with  future  minimum  noncancelable   operating  lease
obligations  (including  the  headquarters  office space  entered into in 2002).
These aggregate commitments are as follows:

      The Company knows of no current or pending  demands on or commitments  for
its liquid assets that will materially affect its liquidity.

      The Company expects its operations to continue generating  sufficient cash
flow to fund working capital requirements and necessary capital investments. The
Company is actively pursuing acquisition  candidates.  While at the present time
it has no agreements or understandings to enter into any such transactions,  the
Company  could  seek  bank  loans or access to  financial  markets  to fund such
acquisitions,  its operations, working capital, necessary capital investments or
other cash requirements should it deem it necessary to do so.

      Cash
      ----

      Cash and cash  equivalents  increased to $12,734 at December 31, 2004 from
$9,239 at December 31, 2003.  The $3,495  increase  resulted  primarily  from an
increase  in net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  of  $12,145  offset
partially  by net cash used in investing  activities  of $1,229 and cash used in
financing activities of $7,421.  Working capital amounted to $23,505 at December
31, 2004 as compared to $17,555 at December 31, 2003, an increase of $5,950.

      Operating Activities
      --------------------

      Cash flows from operating activities provided $12,145 for 2004 as compared
with $11,153 for 2003. The increase in cash flows from operating  activities was
due primarily to increases in net income,  customer deposits,  accounts payable,
accrued expenses,  and deferred income taxes. The foregoing was partially offset
by an increase  in accounts  receivable,  inventory,  and prepaid  expense and a
decrease in amortization  expense.  The increase in prepaid expense is primarily
the result of the timing of payments related to the Company's insurance program.

      Investing Activities
      --------------------

      Capital  expenditures  were  approximately  $1,200 for 2004.  The  capital
expenditures in 2003 of $2,270 included  construction  costs associated with the
completion of the canister  filling  operation at its Green Pond, South Carolina
plant site.  This automated  facility has been designed and  constructed to fill
single  use   canisters   with  ethylene   oxide  for  use  in  medical   device
sterilization. Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $1,700 for
calendar year 2005. The overall effect of the foregoing was that cash flows used
in investing activities were $1,229 in 2004 and $2,314 in 2003.

      Financing Activities
      --------------------

      In June 1999,  the board of directors  authorized  the repurchase of up to
1,000,000  shares of the  Company's  outstanding  common  stock  over a two-year
period commencing July 2, 1999. In June 2004, the board of directors  authorized
an extension to the stock  repurchase  program for up to an  additional  600,000
shares  through June 30, 2005. As of December 31, 2004,  514,974 shares had been
repurchased


                                       15
<PAGE>

under the program at a total cost of $3,179 of which all shares have been issued
by the  Company  under  employee  benefit  plans and for the  exercise  of stock
options.  The Company  intends to acquire shares from time to time at prevailing
market  prices if and to the extent it deems it  advisable  to do so based among
other factors on its assessment of corporate cash flow and market conditions.

      There was no debt  outstanding  at December 31, 2004. On June 1, 2001, the
Company  and  its  principal  bank  entered  into a Loan  Agreement  (the  "Loan
Agreement") providing for a term loan of $13,500 (the "Term Loan"), the proceeds
of which were used to fund the  acquisition  of certain  assets of DCV, Inc. and
its affiliate  Ducoa L.P, as described in Note 4 to the  consolidated  financial
statements.  During the quarter ended  December 31, 2004,  the Company  pre-paid
$7,839, the remaining balance of its term loan.  Borrowings at December 31, 2003
included  borrowings  under the term loan  bearing  interest at LIBOR plus 1.25%
(2.42% at  December  31,  2003).  Certain  provisions  of the Term Loan  require
maintenance of certain financial  ratios,  limit future  borrowings,  and impose
certain other requirements as contained in the agreement.  At December, 2004 and
2003, the Company was in compliance with all restrictive  covenants contained in
the Loan Agreement.  The Loan Agreement also provides for a short-term revolving
credit  facility  of $3,000 (the  "Revolving  Facility").  Borrowings  under the
Revolving Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.00%. No amounts have been drawn
on the Revolving  Facility as of the date hereof. The Revolving Facility expires
on May 30, 2005.  Management  believes that such facility will be renewed in the
normal course of business.

      Proceeds from stock options and warrants exercised totaled $2,563 and $807
in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Dividend payments were $389 and $382 in 2004 and
2003, respectively.

      The overall  effect of the foregoing was that cash flows used in financing
activities were $7,421 in 2004 and $1,331 in 2003.

      Other Matters Impacting Liquidity
      ---------------------------------

      The Company currently  provides  postretirement  benefits in the form of a
retirement  medical  plan  under  a  collective  bargaining  agreement  covering
eligible retired  employees of the Verona  facility.  The amount recorded on the
Company's balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 for this obligation is $934. The
postretirement plan is not funded. Historical cash payments made under such plan
approximated $50 per year.

      In  December  2003,  the  Medicare  Prescription  Drug,   Improvement  and
Modernization  Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law.  The Act  introduced a
plan  sponsor  subsidy  based  on  a  percentage  of  a   beneficiary's   annual
prescription  drug benefits,  within defined  limits,  and the opportunity for a
retiree to obtain prescription drug benefits under Medicare. There was no impact
of the subsidy on the postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic cost in
2004 as Medicare eligible retirees are not covered under the Company's plan.

      Critical Accounting Policies
      ----------------------------

      The  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") has issued  disclosure
guidance  for  "critical   accounting   policies."  The  SEC  defines  "critical
accounting  policies" as those that require  application  of  management's  most
difficult,  subjective  or complex  judgments,  often as a result of the need to
make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may
change in subsequent periods.

      Management  of the  Company is  required  to make  certain  estimates  and
assumptions  during the  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.  These estimates and  assumptions  impact the reported amount of assets
and liabilities  and disclosures of contingent  assets and liabilities as of the
date of the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Estimates and assumptions are
reviewed  periodically  and  the  effects  of  revisions  are  reflected  in the
consolidated  financial  statements  in the  period  they are  determined  to be
necessary. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

      The Company's  significant  accounting policies are described in Note 1 of
the Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Not all of these  significant
accounting policies require management to make difficult,  subjective or complex
judgments or estimates.  However, management considers the following policies to
be critical within the SEC definition.

      Revenue Recognition
      -------------------

      Revenue is recognized upon product shipment,  passage of title and risk of
loss and when  collection is reasonably  assured.  The Company  reports  amounts
billed to  customers  related to shipping  and  handling as revenue and includes
costs incurred for shipping and handling in cost of sales.  Amounts received for
unshipped merchandise are not recognized as revenue but rather they are recorded
as customer deposits and are included in current liabilities.


                                       17
<PAGE>

      Inventories
      -----------

      Inventories  are  valued  at the  lower of cost  (first  in,  first out or
average) or market value and have been  reduced by an  allowance  for excess and
obsolete  inventories.  Inventory  reserves  are  generally  recorded  when  the
inventory for a product  exceeds twelve months of demand for that product and/or
when individual products have been in inventory for greater than six months.

      Long-Lived Assets
      -----------------

      Long-lived assets,  such as property,  plant, and equipment and intangible
assets with finite lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in  circumstances  indicate  that the  carrying  amount  of an asset  may not be
recoverable.  Recoverability  of  assets  to be held and used is  measured  by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated  undiscounted  future
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If the carrying  amount of an
asset  exceeds  its  estimated  future  cash  flows,  an  impairment  charge  is
recognized  by the amount by which the carrying  amount of the asset exceeds the
fair value of the asset, which is generally based on discounted cash flows.

      Goodwill,  which is not subject to  amortization,  is tested  annually for
impairment,  and more frequently if events and  circumstances  indicate that the
asset might be  impaired.  If an  indicator of  impairment  exists,  the Company
determines  the amount of  impairment  based on a comparison of the implied fair
values of its goodwill to its carrying value.

      Accounts Receivable
      -------------------

      We market our products to a diverse customer base,  principally throughout
the United States, Europe, Mexico and Japan. We grant credit terms in the normal
course of business to our customers.  We perform on-going credit  evaluations of
our  customers  and adjust  credit  limits  based upon  payment  history and the
customer's  current  credit  worthiness,  as determined  through review of their
current credit  information.  We continuously  monitor  collections and payments
from  customers  and maintain  allowances  for doubtful  accounts for  estimated
losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required  payments.
Estimated  losses are based on historical  experience and any specific  customer
collection issues identified.  If the financial  condition of our customers were
to  deteriorate  resulting in an impairment  of their ability to make  payments,
additional allowances and related bad debt expense may be required.

      Postemployment Benefits
      -----------------------

      The Company  provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible
retirees and health care benefits for retirees'  eligible  survivors.  The costs
and obligations  related to these benefits reflect the Company's  assumptions as
to  general  economic  conditions  and  health  care  cost  trends.  The cost of
providing  plan  benefits  also  depends on  demographic  assumptions  including
retirements,  mortality, turnover, and plan participation.  If actual experience
differs from these  assumptions,  the cost of  providing  these  benefits  could
increase or decrease.

      In  December  2003,  the  Medicare  Prescription  Drug,   Improvement  and
Modernization  Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law.  The Act  introduced a
plan  sponsor  subsidy  based  on  a  percentage  of  a   beneficiary's   annual
prescription  drug benefits,  within defined  limits,  and the opportunity for a
retiree to obtain prescription drug benefits under Medicare. There was no impact
of the subsidy on the postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic cost in
2004 as Medicare eligible retirees are not covered under the Company's plan.

      Intangible Assets with Finite Lives
      -----------------------------------

      The  useful  life  of an  intangible  asset  is  based  on  the  Company's
assumptions  regarding  expected  use  of the  asset;  the  relationship  of the
intangible asset to another asset or group of assets; any legal,


                                       18
<PAGE>

regulatory or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of the asset
or that enable  renewal or extension of the asset's  legal or  contractual  life
without substantial cost; the effects of obsolescence,  demand,  competition and
other economic factors;  and the level of maintenance  expenditures  required to
obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset and their related impact on
the asset's useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the life of an
intangible  asset has  changed,  it could result in higher  future  amortization
charges or recognition of an impairment loss.

      Income Taxes
      ------------

      Income  taxes are  accounted  for under  the asset and  liability  method.
Deferred  tax  assets  and   liabilities  are  recognized  for  the  future  tax
consequences   attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial  statement
carrying  amounts of existing assets and  liabilities  and their  respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit  carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities  are measured  using enacted tax rates  expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which  those  temporary  differences  are  expected to be
recovered  or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and  liabilities  of a
change in tax rates is  recognized  in earnings in the period that  includes the
enactment date.

      The Company regularly  reviews its deferred tax assets for  recoverability
and would  establish a valuation  allowance if it believed  that such assets may
not be  recovered,  taking  into  consideration  historical  operating  results,
expectations  of future  earnings,  changes in its  operations  and the expected
timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences.

      Related Party Transactions:

      During 2004, the Company was not engaged in related party transactions and
all transactions of the Company were at arms length.

      New Accounting Pronouncements:

      In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123(R), "Share-Based Payment". SFAS
No.  123(R)  revises SFAS 123,  Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation,  and
supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its
related  implementation  guidance.  SFAS 123(R) will require  compensation costs
related to share-based  payment  transactions  to be recognized in the financial
statements (with limited  exceptions).  The amount of compensation  cost will be
measured  based  on the  grant-date  fair  value  of  the  equity  or  liability
instruments issued. Compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an
employee provides service in exchange for the award. This statement is effective
as of the beginning of the first interim or annual  reporting period that begins
after June 15, 2005.  The Company is currently  evaluating  the impact from this
standard on its results of operations and financial position.

      In  November  2004,  the  Financial   Accounting  Standards  Board  issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standard No. 151, "Inventory Costs". The new
Statement  amends  Accounting  Research  Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4,  "Inventory
Pricing,"  to clarify  the  accounting  for  abnormal  amounts of idle  facility
expense,  freight,  handling costs, and wasted material. This Statement requires
that those items be  recognized  as  current-period  charges and  requires  that
allocation of fixed  production  overheads to the cost of conversion be based on
the normal  capacity of the production  facilities.  This statement is effective
for fiscal years  beginning  after June 15, 2005.  We do not expect  adoption of
this statement to have a material  impact on our financial  condition or results
of operations.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

      Cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in money market accounts.
Accordingly,  we believe we have limited  exposure to market risk for changes in
interest  rates.  The  Company  has  no  derivative  financial   instruments  or
derivative  commodity  instruments,  nor does  the  Company  have any  financial
instruments  entered  into for trading or hedging  purposes.  Foreign  sales are
generally  billed  in U.S.  dollars.  The  Company  believes  that its  business
operations  are not exposed in any material  respect to market risk  relating to
foreign currency exchange risk or commodity price risk.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors
Balchem Corporation
New Hampton, New York

We have  audited  the  consolidated  balance  sheet of Balchem  Corporation  and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
earnings,  stockholders'  equity and cash flows for the year then  ended.  These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audit.

We conducted  our audit in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audit  provides  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects,  the financial position of Balchem Corporation
and  subsidiaries  as of December 31, 2004, and the results of their  operations
and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity  with U.S.  generally
accepted accounting principles.

We also have  audited,  in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States),  the  effectiveness  of  Balchem
Corporation and  subsidiaries'  internal control over financial  reporting as of
December   31,   2004,    based   on   "criteria    established    in   Internal
Control--Integrated   Framework   issued   by  the   Committee   of   Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway  Commission (COSO)" and our report dated March 14,
2005  expressed  an  unqualified  opinion  on  management's  assessment  of  the
effectiveness of Balchem Corporation's internal control over financial reporting
and  an  unqualified  opinion  on the  effectiveness  of  Balchem  Corporation's
internal control over financial reporting.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors
Balchem Corporation
New Hampton, New York

      We have  audited  management's  assessment,  included in the  accompanying
"Management's Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting", that Balchem
Corporation  and  subsidiaries   maintained   effective  internal  control  over
financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on "criteria  established in
Internal  Control--Integrated  Framework  issued by the  Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission   (COSO)."  Balchem   Corporation's
management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control over
financial  reporting  and for its  assessment of the  effectiveness  of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's  assessment  and an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

      We  conducted  our audit in  accordance  with the  standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and  perform  the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether
effective  internal  control over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all
material  respects.  Our audit included  obtaining an  understanding of internal
control over financial reporting,  evaluating management's  assessment,  testing
and evaluating the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control,  and
performing   such  other   procedures   as  we   considered   necessary  in  the
circumstances.  We believe that our audit  provides a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

      A  company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is a  process
designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial  statements for external  purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles.  A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the  transactions  and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable  assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use, or  disposition  of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

      Because of its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial
reporting  may not prevent or detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of any
evaluation  of  effectiveness  to future  periods  are  subject to the risk that
controls may become  inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

      In  our  opinion,   management's   assessment  that  Balchem   Corporation
maintained  effective  internal control over financial  reporting as of December
31,  2004,  is fairly  stated,  in all  material  respects,  based on  "criteria
established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (COSO)."  Also  in our
opinion,  Balchem Corporation  maintained,  in all material respects,  effective
internal  control over financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004,  based on "
criteria  established in Internal  Control--Integrated  Framework  issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)."

      We have also  audited,  in  accordance  with the  standards  of the Public
Company  Accounting  Oversight Board (United States),  the consolidated  balance
sheet of Balchem  Corporation  and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows
for the year then  ended  and our  report  dated  March 14,  2005  expressed  an
unqualified opinion.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Balchem Corporation:

      We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheet of Balchem
Corporation  and   subsidiaries  as  of  December  31,  2003,  and  the  related
consolidated  statements of earnings,  stockholders'  equity, and cash flows for
each of the years in the two-year  period ended December 31, 2003. In connection
with our audits of the consolidated  financial statements,  we also have audited
the  consolidated  financial  statement  schedule,  "Schedule  II-Valuation  and
Qualifying  Accounts,"  for  each of the  years  in the  two-year  period  ended
December  31,  2003.  These  consolidated  financial  statements  and  financial
statement  schedule are the  responsibility  of the  Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

      We conducted  our audits in  accordance  with the  standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the
financial  statements  are free of  material  misstatement.  An  audit  includes
examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the  financial  statements.  An audit also  includes  assessing  the  accounting
principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as well as
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial  statements referred to above
present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of Balchem
Corporation  and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003, and the results of their
operations  and their  cash flows for each of the years in the  two-year  period
ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with U.S. generally  accepted  accounting
principles.  Also in our opinion,  the related financial  statement schedule for
each of the  years  in the  two  year  period  ended  December  31,  2003,  when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated  financial  statements for such
years  taken  as a  whole,  presents  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the
information set forth therein.

      As  described  in Note 1 to the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the
Company  adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective January 1, 2002.

Balchem  Corporation  (including,  unless the context  otherwise  requires,  BCP
Ingredients,  Inc., "Balchem",  or the "Company"),  incorporated in the State of
Maryland in 1967, is engaged in the  development,  manufacture  and marketing of
specialty  performance  ingredients for the food, feed and medical sterilization
industries.

Principles of Consolidation
---------------------------

The consolidated  financial  statements include the financial  statements of the
Company  and  its  subsidiaries.   All  significant  intercompany  balances  and
transactions  have been eliminated in consolidation.  Certain  reclassifications
have been made to prior period balances to conform with the presentation for the
current period.

Revenue Recognition
-------------------

Revenue is recognized upon product  shipment,  passage of title and risk of loss
and when collection is reasonably assured. The Company reports amounts billed to
customers  related to  shipping  and  handling  as revenue  and  includes  costs
incurred  for  shipping  and  handling in cost of sales.  Amounts  received  for
unshipped merchandise are not recognized as revenue but rather they are recorded
as customer deposits and are included in current liabilities.  In addition,  the
Company follows the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC)
Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  (SAB) No. 104, " Revenue  Recognition,"  which sets
forth guidelines on the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as
passage of title, installation, payments and customer acceptance.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
-------------------------

The Company  considers  all highly  liquid debt  instruments  with a maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Inventories
-----------

Inventories  are  stated at the  lower of cost or  market,  with cost  generally
determined on a first-in, first-out basis, and have been reduced by an allowance
for excess or obsolete  inventories.  Cost elements include material,  labor and
manufacturing overhead.

Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
----------------------------------------------

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of plant and
equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets as follows:

         Buildings                                   15-25 years
         Equipment                                    3-12 years

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense. Alterations and
major overhauls that extend the lives or increase the capacity of plant assets
are capitalized. When assets are retired or


                                       28
<PAGE>

otherwise  disposed  of,  the cost of the  assets  and the  related  accumulated
depreciation  are removed from the accounts  and any  resultant  gain or loss is
included in earnings.

Business Concentrations
-----------------------

A Specialty  Products  customer  accounted  for 11%, 10% and 9% of the Company's
consolidated  net sales for 2004,  2003 and 2002,  respectively.  This  customer
accounted  for 10% and  12% of the  Company's  accounts  receivable  balance  at
December  31, 2004 and 2003,  respectively.  Approximately  8%, 8% and 9% of the
Company's net sales for 2004,  2003 and 2002,  respectively,  consisted of sales
outside the United States, predominately to Europe, Japan, and Mexico.

Trade  receivables  potentially  subject the Company to credit risk. The Company
extends  credit to its  customers  based upon an  evaluation  of the  customers'
financial  condition  and  credit  histories.  The  majority  of  the  Company's
customers are major national or international corporations.

Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
---------------------------------------

Goodwill  represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses
acquired.  The  Company  adopted  the  provisions  of  SFAS  No.  141,  Business
Combinations,  and SFAS No. 142,  Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets,  as of
January 1, 2002.  These  standards  require  the use of the  purchase  method of
business  combination  and define an intangible  asset.  Goodwill and intangible
assets  acquired in a purchase  business  combination  and determined to have an
indefinite  useful life are not amortized,  but instead tested for impairment at
least  annually in accordance  with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 142
also requires that  intangible  assets with estimable  useful lives be amortized
over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values,
and reviewed for  impairment in  accordance  with SFAS No. 144,  Accounting  for
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. All of the Company's goodwill arose
from the June 2001 acquisition described in Note 4.

As required by SFAS No. 142,  the Company  performed  an  assessment  of whether
there was an indication  that goodwill was impaired at the date of adoption.  In
connection  therewith,  the Company determined that its operations  consisted of
three  reporting  units and  determined  each  reporting  units'  fair value and
compared it to the reporting unit's net book value. Since the fair value of each
reporting  unit  exceeded  its  carrying  amount,  there  was no  indication  of
impairment and no further  transitional  impairment testing was required.  As of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company also performed an impairment test of its
goodwill  balance.  As of such dates the Company's  reporting  units' fair value
exceeded  their carrying  amounts,  and therefore  there was no indication  that
goodwill was impaired.  Accordingly, the Company was not required to perform any
further  impairment tests. The Company plans to perform its impairment test each
December 31.

The Company had  unamortized  goodwill in the amount of $6,368 at both  December
31, 2004 and December 31, 2003  subject to the  provisions  of SFAS Nos. 141 and
142.  Unamortized  goodwill is allocated to the Company's reportable segments as
follows:

==============================================================

Income Taxes
------------

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and  liability  method.  Deferred
tax assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  for the  future tax  consequences
attributable to differences  between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing  assets and  liabilities  and their  respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit  carryforwards.  Deferred  tax assets  and  liabilities  are
measured  using  enacted tax rates  expected  to apply to taxable  income in the
years in which those  temporary  differences  are  expected to be  recovered  or
settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and  liabilities  of a change in tax
rates is recognized  in income in the period that  includes the enactment  date.
The Company  regularly  reviews its deferred tax assets for  recoverability  and
would establish a valuation allowance if it believed that such assets may not be
recovered, taking into consideration historical operating results,  expectations
of future  earnings,  changes in its operations  and the expected  timing of the
reversals of existing temporary differences.

Use of Estimates
----------------

Management of the Company is required to make certain  estimates and assumptions
during the preparation of consolidated  financial  statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  These
estimates and  assumptions  impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities
and  disclosures  of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  as of the date of the
consolidated  financial  statements.  Estimates  and  assumptions  are  reviewed
periodically  and the effects of revisions  are  reflected  in the  consolidated
financial  statements in the period they are determined to be necessary.  Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
-----------------------------------

The Company has a number of  financial  instruments,  none of which are held for
trading  purposes.  The Company  estimates  that the fair value of all financial
instruments  at December 31, 2004 and 2003 does not differ  materially  from the
aggregate  carrying  values  of  its  financial   instruments  recorded  in  the
accompanying  consolidated balance sheets. The estimated fair value amounts have
been  determined  by  the  Company  using  available   market   information  and
appropriate  valuation  methodologies.   Considerable  judgment  is  necessarily
required in  interpreting  market data to develop the  estimates  of fair value,
and,  accordingly,  the estimates are not necessarily  indicative of the amounts
that the Company  could  realize in a current  market  exchange.  The  Company's
financial  instruments,   principally  cash  equivalents,  accounts  receivable,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities, are carried at cost which approximates
fair  value due to the  short-term  maturity  of these  instruments.  As amounts
outstanding  under the Company's credit  agreements bear interest  approximating
current market rates, their carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Research and Development
------------------------

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Stock Option Plan
-----------------

The Company has stock based  employee  compensation  plans,  which are described
more  fully  in Note 8. The  Company  accounts  for its  stock  option  plans in
accordance with the provisions of Accounting  Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.
25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", and related


                                       30
<PAGE>

interpretations.  As such, compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant
only if the current  market price of the  underlying  stock exceeds the exercise
price. No stock based employee  compensation  cost is reflected in net earnings,
as all options  granted  under  those  plans had an exercise  price equal to the
market value of the  underlying  common stock on the date of grant.  The Company
has adopted the  disclosure  standards  of  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  (SFAS) No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation"  and SFAS
148,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation - Transition and Disclosure an
amendment of FASB Statement 123," which require the Company to provide pro forma
net  earnings  and pro forma  earnings  per share  disclosures  for employee and
director  stock  option  grants  made  as if  the  fair-value  based  method  of
accounting  for stock options as defined in SFAS No. 123 has been  applied.  The
following table  illustrates the effect on net earnings and per share amounts if
the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to
stock based employee compensation:

Impairment of Long-lived Assets
-------------------------------

Long-lived  assets,  such as  property,  plant,  and  equipment,  and  purchased
intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events
or changes in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying  amount of an asset may
not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by
a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If the carrying  amount of an
asset  exceeds  its  estimated  future  cash  flows,  an  impairment  charge  is
recognized  by the amount by which the carrying  amount of the asset exceeds the
fair value of the asset, which is generally based on discounted cash flows.

New Accounting Pronouncements
-----------------------------

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123(R),  "Share-Based Payment".  SFAS No.
123(R) revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes
APB Opinion No. 25,  Accounting  for Stock Issued to Employees,  and its related
implementation  guidance. SFAS 123(R) will require compensation costs related to
share-based  payment  transactions to be recognized in the financial  statements
(with  limited  exceptions).  The amount of  compensation  cost will be measured
based on the  grant-date  fair  value of the  equity  or  liability  instruments
issued.  Compensation  cost will be recognized  over the period that an employee
provides  service in exchange for the award.  This  statement is effective as of
the beginning of the first interim or annual  reporting period that begins after
June 15, 2005. The


                                       31
<PAGE>

Company is currently  evaluating the impact from this standard on its results of
operations and financial position.

In November 2004, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standard No. 151,  "Inventory  Costs".  The new Statement
amends Accounting  Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory  Pricing," to
clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility  expense,  freight,
handling costs, and wasted material. This Statement requires that those items be
recognized  as  current-period  charges and requires  that  allocation  of fixed
production  overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal  capacity
of the  production  facilities.  This  statement is  effective  for fiscal years
beginning  after June 15, 2005. We do not expect  adoption of this  statement to
have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Net Earnings Per Common Share
-----------------------------

Basic net earnings per common share is  calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted
net earnings per common share is  calculated in a manner  consistent  with basic
net earnings per common share except that the weighted  average number of common
shares   outstanding   also  includes  the  dilutive  effect  of  stock  options
outstanding (using the treasury stock method).

NOTE 2-INVENTORIES
------------------

Inventories at December 31, 2004 and 2003 consist of the following:

=================================================
                            2004           2003
-------------------------------------------------
Raw materials            $   2,305      $   1,914

-------------------------------------------------
  Total inventories      $   6,319      $   5,961
=================================================

On a regular  basis,  the Company  evaluates its  inventory  balances for excess
quantities and obsolescence by analyzing demand, inventory on hand, sales levels
and  other  information.  Based on these  evaluations,  inventory  balances  are
reduced, if necessary. The reserve for obsolete or slow moving inventory was $31
and $76 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

NOTE 3- PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

                                       32
<PAGE>

Effective as of June 1, 2001,  pursuant to a certain Asset  Purchase  Agreement,
dated as of May 21, 2001 (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"), BCP Ingredients, Inc.
("Buyer"),  a wholly owned subsidiary of Balchem  Corporation,  acquired certain
assets,  excluding accounts receivable and inventories,  relating to the choline
animal feed, human choline nutrient and encapsulated  product lines of DCV, Inc.
and its  affiliate,  DuCoa L.P.,  including  DuCoa's  manufacturing  facility in
Verona, Missouri.

The purchase price,  including acquisition costs, was approximately  $15,290, of
which  approximately  $14,259 was paid in cash, with the balance  reflecting the
assumption by the Buyer of certain  liabilities.  The Buyer also assumed certain
obligations  of  DuCoa  for  retiree  medical   benefits  under  the  collective
bargaining  agreement  covering various  employees at the Verona  facility.  The
acquisition  was  financed  with a $13,500 term loan and  approximately  $759 in
existing cash. The Asset Purchase Agreement also called for the payment of up to
an additional  $2,750 based upon the sales of specified  product lines achieving
certain gross margin levels (in excess of specified  thresholds)  over the three
year period  following  the  closing,  with no more than $1,000  payable for any
particular   yearly  period.   Additionally,   pursuant  to  the  agreement,   a
reimbursement  of a part of the purchase  price could be due the Company for the
first year of such  calculation.  Based upon the results of the  calculation for
the first  period ended June 2002,  a  reimbursement  of $30 was received by the
Company in 2003. Such  reimbursement  was recorded as a reduction of the cost of
the acquired product lines. No contingent  consideration  was earned or paid for
the second and third  periods  ended  June 2003 and 2004.

The allocation of the purchase price of the acquisition has been assigned to the
net assets acquired as follows:

The above  acquisition  has been  accounted  for using  the  purchase  method of
accounting  and, the purchase price of the  acquisition has been assigned to the
net assets  acquired  based on the fair value of such assets and  liabilities at
the date of  acquisition.  The  consolidated  financial  statements  include the
results of operations of the acquired product lines from the date of purchase.

Amortization of identifiable intangible assets was approximately $688 and $1,080
for 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Assuming no change in the gross carrying value
of  identifiable  intangible  assets,  the  estimated  amortization  expense  is
approximately  $50 per annum for 2005  through  2009.  At December  31, 2004 and
2003, there were no identifiable  intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
as defined by SFAS No. 142.  Identifiable  intangible  assets are  reflected  in
Intangible assets, net in the Company's  consolidated balance sheets. There were
no changes to the useful lives of intangible  assets subject to  amortization in
2004 and 2003.

In 1994, the Company purchased certain tangible and intangible assets for one of
its packaged  specialty products for $1,500 in cash and the Company was required
to pay additional  contingent  amounts to compensate the seller for the purchase
of the seller's  customer  list in  accordance  with a formula  based on profits
derived from sales of the specialty  packaged  ingredient.  In 1998, the Company
elected to exercise  the early  payment  option under the  agreement  and made a
final payment of $3,700 to the seller in  settlement  of its remaining  purchase
price  obligation  under the terms of the  agreement.  Amounts  allocated to the
customer list were being amortized over its remaining estimated useful life on a
straight-line basis concluding in August 2004 and are included in cost of sales.
Amortization expense included in cost of sales related to this customer list was
$636 in 2004 and $997 in 2003 and 2002.

The  Company  is in the  process  of  re-registering  a  product  it  sells  for
sterilization of medical devices and other uses. The re-registration requirement
is  a  result  of  a   congressional   enactment   during  1988   requiring  the
re-registration  of this  product  and  all  other  products  that  are  used as
pesticides.  The  Company,  in  conjunction  with one  other  company,  has been
conducting  the  required  testing  under  the  direction  of the  Environmental
Protection  Agency  ("EPA").  Testing has concluded and the EPA has stated that,
due to a backlog of projects,  it cannot  anticipate a date for  completing  the
re-registration  process for this product at this time. The Company's management
believes it will be successful in obtaining  re-registration  for the product as
it has met the EPA's  requirements thus far, although no assurance can be given.
Additionally,  the  product  is used as a  sterilant  with no known  substitute.
Management  believes absence of availability of this product could not be easily
tolerated by medical  device  manufacturers  and the health care industry due to
the resultant infection potential if the product were unavailable.

NOTE 6 - LONG-TERM DEBT & CREDIT AGREEMENTS
-------------------------------------------

There was no debt outstanding at December 31, 2004. On June 1, 2001, the Company
and its  principal  bank entered into a Loan  Agreement  (the "Loan  Agreement")
providing  for a term loan of $13,500 (the "Term  Loan"),  the proceeds of which
were used to fund the aforementioned  acquisition of certain assets of DCV, Inc.
and  its  affiliate  Ducoa  L.P,  as  described  in  Note 4 to the  consolidated
financial  statements.  During the quarter ended  December 31, 2004, the Company
pre-paid $7,839, the remaining balance of its term loan.  Borrowings at December
31, 2003 included  borrowings under the term loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus
1.25% (2.42% at December 31, 2003).  Certain provisions of the Term Loan require
maintenance of certain financial  ratios,  limit future  borrowings,  and impose
certain other requirements as contained in the agreement.  At December, 2004 and
2003, the Company was in compliance with all restrictive  covenants contained in
the Loan Agreement.  The Loan Agreement also provides for a short-term revolving
credit  facility  of $3,000 (the  "Revolving  Facility").  Borrowings  under the
Revolving Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.00%. No amounts have been drawn
on the  Revolving  Facility as of  December  31,  2004 and 2003.  The  Revolving
Facility was extended and now expires on May 30, 2005.  Management believes that
such facility will be renewed in the normal course of business.

Indebtedness  under the Loan  Agreement is secured by  substantially  all of the
assets of the Company other than real properties.

There is no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at December 31, 2004 and
2003.  In  assessing  the  realizability  of  deferred  tax  assets,  management
considers  whether it is more  likely  than not that some  portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The ultimate  realization of deferred
tax assets is dependent  upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which  those  temporary  differences  become  deductible.  Management
considers the scheduled  reversal of deferred tax liabilities,  projected future
taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon
the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income
over the periods in which the  deferred  tax assets are  deductible,  management
believes it is more likely than not the  Company  will  realize the  benefits of
these  deductible  differences.  The amount of  deferred  tax asset  realizable,
however,  could change if management's  estimate of future taxable income should
change.

NOTE 8 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
-----------------------------

On  December  16,  2004,  the  Board of  Directors  of the  Company  approved  a
three-for-two  split of the Company's common stock to be distributed in the form
of a stock  dividend  to  shareholders  of record on  December  30,  2004.  Such
distribution  was made on January  20,  2005.  Accordingly,  the stock split was


                                       35
<PAGE>

recognized by  reclassifying  the par value of the additional  shares  resulting
from the split, from additional  paid-in capital to common stock. All references
to number of common shares and per share amounts except shares authorized in the
accompanying  consolidated  financial statements were retroactively  adjusted to
reflect the effect of the stock split.

In June  1999,  the  board  of  directors  authorized  the  repurchase  of up to
1,000,000  shares of the  Company's  outstanding  common  stock  over a two-year
period  commencing  July 2,  1999,  which  was  subsequently  extended.  Through
December 31, 2004, the Company has repurchased 343,316 shares at an average cost
of $9.26 per share of which no shares  remain in treasury at December  31, 2004.
In June  2004,  the board of  directors  authorized  an  extension  to the stock
repurchase  program for up to an additional  600,000  shares,  that is, over and
above those 343,316 shares  repurchased to date under the program,  through June
30, 2005.

In June 1999, the Company adopted the Balchem  Corporation  1999 Stock Plan (the
"1999 Stock Plan") for officers, directors,  directors emeritus and employees of
and  consultants  to the  Company and its  subsidiaries.  The 1999 Stock Plan is
administered  by the  Compensation  Committee  of the Board of  Directors of the
Company.  Under the plan, options and rights to purchase shares of the Company's
common  stock are  granted at prices  established  at the time of grant.  Option
grants generally become exercisable 20% after 1 year, 60% after 2 years and 100%
after 3 years from the date of grant for employees and are fully  exercisable on
the  date  of  grant  for  directors.  Other  option  grants  are  either  fully
exercisable  on the date of  grant  or  become  exercisable  thereafter  in such
installments  as the  Committee  may  specify.  The 1999 Stock Plan  reserves an
aggregate  of 900,000  shares of common stock for  issuance  under the Plan.  In
April  2003,  the Board of  Directors  of the Company  adopted and  stockholders
subsequently  approved,  the Amended and Restated  1999 Stock Plan which amended
the 1999  Stock  Plan by: (i)  increasing  the number of shares of Common  Stock
reserved for issuance under the 1999 Stock Plan by 900,000 shares, to a total of
1,800,000  shares of Common Stock;  and (ii) confirming the right of the Company
to grant awards of Common Stock ("Awards") in addition to the other Stock Rights
available  under the 1999 Stock Plan,  and providing  certain  language  changes
relating  thereto.  The 1999 Stock Plan replaced the Company's  incentive  stock
option  plan (the "ISO  Plan")  and its  non-qualified  stock  option  plan (the
"Non-Qualified  Plan"),  both of which  expired  on June 24,  1999.  Unexercised
options  granted  under the ISO Plan and the  Non-Qualified  Plan  prior to such
termination remain  exercisable in accordance with their terms.  Options granted
under the ISO Plan generally  become  exercisable  20% after 1 year, 60% after 2
years and 100% after 3 years  from the date of grant,  and expire ten years from
the date of grant.  Options  granted  under the  Non-Qualified  Plan,  generally
vested on the date of grant, and expire ten years from the date of grant.

A summary of stock option plan activity for 2004, 2003, and 2002 for all plans
is as follows:

The fair value of each stock option granted during the year is estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
assumptions:

================================================================================

If the  fair-value  method  to  measure  compensation  cost for all of the above
mentioned  plans and awards  had been  used,  the  compensation  cost,  which is
required to be charged against income would have been $722 in 2004, $731 in 2003
and $452 in 2002. See Note 1 for the pro forma presentation.

The Company had 1,200,  166,150 and 94,950 stock options outstanding at December
31,  2004,  2003 and 2002,  respectively  that could  potentially  dilute  basic
earnings per share in future periods that were not included in diluted  earnings
per share because their effect on the period presented was anti-dilutive.

NOTE 10 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
--------------------------------

The Company  sponsors a 401(k)  savings  plan for eligible  employees.  The plan
allows participants to make pretax contributions and the Company matches certain
percentages of those pretax  contributions  with shares of the Company's  common
stock.   The  profit  sharing   portion  of  the  plan  is   discretionary   and
non-contributory. All amounts contributed to the plan are deposited into a trust
fund  administered  by  independent  trustees.  The Company  provided for profit
sharing contributions and matching 401(k) savings plan contributions of $301 and
$257 in 2004, $307 and $273 in 2003 and $241 and $320 in 2002, respectively.

The Company also currently  provides  postretirement  benefits in the form of an
unfunded  retirement  medical  plan  under  a  collective  bargaining  agreement
covering eligible retired  employees of the Verona facility.  The Company uses a
December 31 measurement date for its postretirement medical plan.

The actuarial recorded liabilities for such unfunded postretirement benefit is
as follows:

Assumed  health  care  cost  trend  rates  have been  used in the  valuation  of
postretirement  health insurance benefits.  The trend rate is 12 percent in 2004
declining to 5 percent in 2012 and thereafter.  A one percentage  point increase
in health  care cost trend  rates in each year would  increase  the  accumulated
postretirement  benefit  obligation  as of December 31, 2004 by $105 and the net
periodic  postretirement  benefit cost for 2004 by $11. A one  percentage  point
decrease  in  health  care cost  trend  rates in each year  would  decrease  the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2004 by $90 and
the net  periodic  postretirement  benefit  cost for 2004 by $10.  The  weighted
average discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 6.00% in 2004 and 6.25% in 2003.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement and Modernization
Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law.  The Act  introduced  a plan  sponsor
subsidy  based on a  percentage  of a  beneficiary's  annual  prescription  drug
benefits,  within defined  limits,  and the  opportunity for a retiree to obtain
prescription drug benefits under Medicare. There was no impact of the subsidy on
the postretirement  benefit obligation and net periodic cost in 2004 as Medicare
eligible retirees are not covered under the Company's plan.

NOTE 11 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

In  February  2002,  the  Company  entered  into a ten (10) year lease  which is
cancelable in 2009 for  approximately  20,000  square feet of office space.  The
office space is now serving as the Company's general offices and as a laboratory
facility.  The Company  leases most of its vehicles and office  equipment  under
noncancelable operating leases, which expire at various times through 2011. Rent

In 1982, the Company  discovered and thereafter removed a number of buried drums
containing  unidentified  waste  material from the Company's site in Slate Hill,
New York. The Company  thereafter  entered into a Consent Decree to evaluate the
drum site with the New York Department of Environmental  Conservation  ("NYDEC")
and  performed a Remedial  Investigation/Feasibility  Study that was approved by
NYDEC in February 1994.  Based on NYDEC  requirements,  the Company  cleaned the
area and removed  additional  soil from the drum burial site.  The cost for this
clean-up and the related reports was approximately  $164. Clean-up was completed
in 1996,  but NYDEC  required the Company to monitor the site through 1999.  The
Company  continues  to be involved in  discussions  with NYDEC to evaluate  test
results and determine what, if any,  additional  actions will be required on the
part of the  Company  to close  out the  remediation  of this  site.  Additional
actions,  if any,  would likely  require the Company to continue  monitoring the
site. The cost of such monitoring has recently been less than $5 per year.

The Company's  Verona  facility,  while held by a prior owner, was designated by
the EPA as a Superfund site and placed on the National  Priorities List in 1983,
because of dioxin contamination on portions of the site.  Remediation  conducted
by the prior owner under the oversight of the EPA and the Missouri Department of
Natural  Resources  ("MDNR")  included removal of dioxin  contaminated  soil and
equipment,  capping of areas of residual  contamination in four relatively small
areas  of  the  site  separate  from  the  manufacturing  facilities,   and  the
installation of wells to monitor  groundwater and surface water contamination by
organic chemicals.  No ground water or surface water treatment was required. The
Company  believes that  remediation  of the site is complete.  In 1998,  the EPA
certified the work on the contaminated  soils to be complete.  In February 2000,
after the conclusion of two years of monitoring  groundwater  and surface water,
the former owner submitted a draft third party risk assessment report to the EPA
and MDNR  recommending  no  further  action.  The prior  owner is  awaiting  the
response of the EPA and MDNR to the draft risk assessment.

While the  Company  must  maintain  the  integrity  of the  capped  areas in the
remediation  areas on the site, the prior owner is responsible for completion of
any further  Superfund  remedy.  The Company is indemnified by the sellers under
its May 2001 asset  purchase  agreement  covering its  acquisition of the Verona
facility for potential liabilities associated with the Superfund site and one of
the sellers, in turn, has the benefit of certain contractual  indemnification by
the prior owner that is implementing the above-described Superfund remedy.

From time to time,  the  Company  is a party to various  litigation,  claims and
assessments, management believes that the alternate outcome of such matters will
not have a material  effect on the Company's  consolidated  financial  position,
results of operations, or liquidity.

NOTE 12 - SEGMENT INFORMATION
-----------------------------

The Company's  reportable segments are strategic  businesses that offer products
and services to different markets. As a result of the aforementioned acquisition
of certain assets of DCV, Inc. and its affiliate,


                                       40
<PAGE>

DuCoa L.P.,  the  Company  presently  has three  segments,  specialty  products,
encapsulated / nutritional  products and, the  unencapsulated  feed  supplements
segment  (also  referred to as BCP  Ingredients).  Products  relating to choline
animal   feed  for   non-ruminant   animals  are   primarily   reported  in  the
unencapsulated  feed supplements  segment.  Human choline nutrient  products and
encapsulated  products are reported in the  encapsulated / nutritional  products
segment.  They are managed  separately  because each business requires different
technology and marketing strategies.  The specialty products segment consists of
three specialty chemicals:  ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and methyl chloride.
The  encapsulated / nutritional  products segment is principally in the business
of encapsulating  performance ingredients for use throughout the food and animal
health industries for processing, mixing, packaging applications and nutritional
fortification  and  for  shelf-life   improvement.   The   unencapsulated   feed
supplements  segment is in the business of manufacturing  and supplying  choline
chloride,  an  essential  nutrient for animal  health,  to the poultry and swine
industries.  In  addition,  certain  derivatives  of choline  chloride  are also
manufactured  and sold into  industrial  applications  and are  included  in the
unencapsulated  feed  supplements  segment.  The Company sells  products for all
segments  through  its own  sales  force,  independent  distributors,  and sales
agents. The accounting  policies of the segments are the same as those described
in the summary of significant accounting policies.

To the Board of Directors
Balchem Corporation
New Hampton, NY

Our audit was conducted in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  and was made for the  purpose of
forming an opinion on the basic  consolidated  financial  statements  taken as a
whole. The consolidated  supplemental schedule Valuation and Qualifying Accounts
for the year ended  December  31, 2004,  is presented  for purposes of complying
with the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission's  rules and is not a part of the
basic consolidated financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the
auditing  procedures  applied in our audit of the basic  consolidated  financial
statements  and, in our opinion,  is fairly  stated in all material  respects in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
Financial Disclosure

      KPMG  LLP  ("KPMG")  resigned  as  the  Company's  principal  accountants,
effective  August 18, 2004.  KPMG's audit reports on the Company's  consolidated
financial  statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 and
2003 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and were not
qualified or modified as to uncertainty  or audit scope.  Their report did refer
to a change in accounting for goodwill and intangible  assets effective  January
1, 2002.

      During the Company's two most recent fiscal years ended  December 31, 2002
and 2003, and the subsequent  interim period from January 1, 2004 through August
18, 2004, the date of KPMG's  resignation,  (i) there were no disagreements with
KPMG on any matter of accounting  principles or practices,  financial  statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved
to KPMG's satisfaction,  would have caused KPMG to make reference to the subject
matter of the  disagreements in connection with its report,  and (ii) there were
no  "reportable  events"  as  such  term is  defined  in  Item  304(a)(1)(v)  of
Regulation S-K.

Item 9A Controls and Procedures

      Disclosure  Controls and Procedures - The Company's  management,  with the
participation  of the  Company's  Chief  Executive  Officer and Chief  Financial
Officer,  has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's  disclosure  controls
and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules  13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)  under
the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as amended) as of the end of the period
covered  by this  Annual  Report on Form  10-K.  Based on such  evaluation,  the
Company's  Chief Executive  Officer and Chief  Financial  Officer have concluded
that,  as of the end of such  period,  the  Company's  disclosure  controls  and
procedures are effective.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

      Management  of  Balchem  Corporation.,   together  with  its  consolidated
subsidiaries  (the  "Company"),  is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate  internal  control over  financial  reporting.  The Company's  internal
control over financial  reporting is a process designed under the supervision of
the Company's  principal  executive and principal  financial officers to provide
reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the
preparation  of  the  Company's  financial  statements  for  external  reporting
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

      As of  December  31,  2004,  management  conducted  an  assessment  of the
effectiveness of the Company's  internal control over financial  reporting based
on the framework  established in Internal Control - Integrated  Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Based on this assessment,  management has determined that the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 was effective.

      Our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes  policies and
procedures  that  pertain to the  maintenance  of records  that,  in  reasonable
detail,  accurately and fairly reflect  transactions and dispositions of assets;
provide  reasonable  assurances that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to
permit  preparation of financial  statements in accordance  with U.S.  generally
accepted  accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures are being
made only in accordance with  authorizations  of management and the directors of
the Company;  and provide reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely
detection of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use or  disposition  of the  Company's
assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

      Management's  assessment of the  effectiveness  of the Company's  internal
control  over  financial  reporting  as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by
McGladrey & Pullen, LLP, an independent

registered  public  accounting  firm,  as stated in their report  which  appears
herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

      There has been no change in our internal control over financial  reporting
in our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
