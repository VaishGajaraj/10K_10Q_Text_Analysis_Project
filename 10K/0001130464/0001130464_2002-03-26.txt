                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     This Form 10-K includes "forward-looking statements" as defined by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements concern our plans,
expectations and objectives for future operations. All statements, other than
statements of historical facts, included in this Form 10-K that address
activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will or
may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. The words "believe,"
"plan," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate" "project" and similar expressions are
also intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
statements include, among others, such things as:

         o    expansion and growth of our business and operations;
         o    future financial performance;
         o    future acquisition and development of power plants;
         o    future production of coal, oil and natural gas;
         o    reserve estimates; and
         o    business strategy.

     These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions, which we believe
are reasonable based on current expectations and projections about future events
and industry conditions and trends affecting our business. However, whether
actual results and developments will conform to our expectations and predictions
is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual
results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking
statements, including the following factors:

         o    prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions with
              respect to allowed rates of return, industry and rate structure,
              acquisition and disposal of assets and facilities, operation and
              construction of plant facilities, recovery of purchased power and
              other capital investments, and present or prospective wholesale
              and retail competition;
         o    changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and
              policies;
         o    weather conditions;
         o    population growth and demographic patterns;
         o    competition for retail and wholesale customers;
         o    pricing and transportation of commodities;
         o    market demand, including structural market changes;

Industry Overview

In the last decade, many U.S. regulatory bodies have taken steps to transform
the energy sectors which they regulate to encourage competition, introduce
customer choice and, in some cases, to improve the operational performance of
strategic energy assets. In particular, the electric power industry is
undergoing substantial change as a result of regulatory initiatives at the
federal and state levels. As early as the mid-1990's, new regulatory initiatives
to increase competition in the domestic power generation industry had been
adopted or were being considered at the federal level and by many states. The
primary focus of such efforts was to increase competition through the
disaggregation of the traditional utility functions of generation, transmission,
distribution and marketing of electricity into competitive or partially
regulated businesses. This resulted in new investment opportunities to enter
previously non-competitive or closed markets.

In 1992, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued Order 636,
followed by Order 888 in 1996, to increase competition by easing entry into
natural gas and electricity markets. These orders require owners and operators
of natural gas and power transmission systems to make transmission service
available on a non-discriminatory basis to energy suppliers. In order to better
assure competitive access to the transmission network on a non-discriminatory
basis, FERC issued Order 2000 in December 1999, which encourages electric
utilities with power transmission assets to voluntarily form regional
transmission organizations to provide regional management and control of
transmission assets independent of firms that sell electricity.

The electric power industry has also witnessed growing consumer demand and
frequent regional shortages of electricity over the past several years. The
summers of 1998, 1999 and 2000 and the winter of 2000-2001 have all been
characterized by very high peak prices for electricity in a number of recently
created wholesale electricity markets. Mild weather patterns in the summer of
2001 and winter of 2001-2002 and the current recession have mitigated most
regional energy shortages. However, we believe that the reduction in demand for
energy is temporary and there remains a long-term need for new electric
generating capacity to relieve shortages of electricity and to replace
inefficient and obsolete facilities.

The oil and gas industry has experienced volatile changes in commodity prices in
the last year. Price increases have been driven in part by several years of
modest drilling activity combined with strong growth in demand for energy
commodities. Price decreases have been driven by weather patterns, the recession
and actions by OPEC. Natural gas is expected to remain the fuel of choice and
demand for natural gas is expected to be strong in the future as an increasing
number of gas-fired power plants are brought into service.

The telecommunications industry is currently undergoing widespread changes
brought about by, among other things, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the
decisions of federal and state regulators to open the monopoly local telephone
and cable television markets to competition and the need for higher speed,
higher capacity networks to meet the increasing consumer demand for expanded
telecommunications services, including broader video choices and high speed data
and Internet services. The convergence of these trends and the inherent
limitations of most existing networks have created opportunities for new types
of communications companies capable of providing a wide range of voice, video
and data services through new and advanced high speed, high capacity
telecommunications networks.

As a result of historical and anticipated regulatory initiatives and the
increasing demand for electricity, fuel and broadband services, we believe there
are significant opportunities for the development and growth of our integrated
energy businesses, our regulated utility and our communications business.

Strategy

Our strategy is to build long-term shareholder value by adding and augmenting
revenue streams from our diverse integrated energy operations. We have
implemented a balanced, integrated and risk managed approach to fuel production,
energy marketing and independent power. We expect our integrated energy
businesses to operate nationwide, with an integrated regional emphasis on the
western half of the United States. Built on the strength of our electric
utility, we have enhanced our local operations by providing broadband
communications. Our utility and communications businesses intend to continue
focusing their retail operations primarily in Rapid City and the northern Black
Hills region of South Dakota, with wholesale power sales concentrated primarily
in the Rocky Mountain and West Coast regions and the ability to move a limited
amount of power to the eastern markets. Our diverse operations avoid reliance on
any single element to achieve our growth objective. This diversity provides a
measure of stability in volatile or cyclical periods.

Our strategy includes the following key elements:

     o    grow our power  generation  segment by developing and acquiring  power
          projects in targeted western markets;

     o    expand  the  generating  capacity  of our  existing  sites  through  a
          strategy known as "brownfield development;"

     o    sell a large  percentage of the production from our independent  power
          projects  through  long-term  contracts in order to secure  attractive
          investment returns;

     o    increase our reserves and production of natural gas and crude oil;

     o    maintain  abundant clean coal reserves to assure  low-cost  generation
          capability;

     o    exploit  our fuel cost  advantages  and our  operating  and  marketing
          expertise to remain a low-cost power producer;

     o    exploit our knowledge and market  expertise  while  managing the risks
          inherent in fuel marketing;

     o    build  and  maintain  strong   relationships   with  wholesale  energy
          customers; and

     o    capitalize on our utility's established market presence, relationships
          and customer loyalty.

Grow our Power Generation Segment by Developing and Acquiring Power Projects in
Targeted Western Markets. Our aim is to continue the development of power plants
in regional markets based on prevailing supply and demand fundamentals in a
manner that complements our existing fuel assets and fuel and energy marketing
capabilities. This approach aims to capitalize on market growth while managing
our fuel procurement needs. Over the next few years, we intend to grow through a
combination of disciplined acquisitions and development of new power generation
facilities primarily in the western region where we believe we have the detailed
knowledge of market fundamentals and competitive advantage to achieve attractive
returns. We believe the following trends will provide us with growth
opportunities in the future:

     o    Demand  for  electricity  in the  western  regions  will  grow and new
          generation capacity will be required over the next several years.

     o    New electric generation construction will be predominantly  gas-fired,
          which may  create  further  competitive  cost  advantages  for new and
          existing  coal-fired  generation  assets.

                                       6
<PAGE>

     o    Transmission   construction  will  significantly  lag  new  generation
          development,  favoring  new  development  located near load centers or
          existing, unconstrained transmission locations.

     o    Disaggregation  of the electric  utility  industry from  traditionally
          vertically    integrated    utilities   into   separate    generation,
          transmission,  distribution  and  marketing  entities  will  continue,
          thereby creating opportunities for acquisitions and joint ventures.

Expand the Generating Capacity of Our Existing Sites Through a Strategy Known as
"Brownfield Development." We believe that existing sites with opportunities for
brownfield expansion generally offer the potential for greater returns than
development of new sites through a "greenfield" strategy. Brownfield sites
typically offer several competitive advantages over greenfield development,
including:

     o    proximity to existing transmission systems;

     o    operating cost advantages related to ownership of shared facilities;

     o    a less costly and time consuming permitting process; and

     o    potential ability to share  infrastructure with existing facilities at
          the same site.

We are currently expanding our capacity with brownfield development underway at
our Arapahoe, Las Vegas and Wyodak sites, and believe that our Fountain Valley,
Wyodak and Las Vegas sites in particular provide further opportunities for a
significant expansion of our gas- and coal-fired generating capacity over the
next several years.

Sell a Large Percentage of the Production From Our Independent Power Projects
Through Long-Term Contracts in Order to Secure Attractive Investment Returns. By
selling the majority of our energy and capacity under mid- and long-term
contracts, we believe that we can satisfy the requirements of our customers
while earning more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than
we could by selling our energy into the more volatile spot markets.
Approximately 90 percent of our power generation assets are under long-term
contracts.

Increase Our Reserves and Production of Natural Gas and Crude Oil and Maintain
Abundant Clean Coal Reserves to Assure Low-Cost Generation Capability. We aim to
support the fuel requirements of our growing portfolio of power plants as well
as power plants owned by others by emphasizing natural gas and coal production.
Our strategy is to expand our natural gas reserves through a combination of
acquisitions and drilling programs and expand our coal production through the
construction of mine-mouth coal-fired generation plants at our Wyodak mine
location. Our objective is to maintain coal reserves to serve our mine-mouth
coal-fired generation plants directly and to maintain sufficient natural gas
production either to directly serve or indirectly hedge the fuel cost exposure
of our gas-fired generation plants. Specifically, we plan to:

     o    substantially  increase  our natural  gas  reserves  while  minimizing
          exploration risk by focusing on lower-risk exploration and development
          drilling as well as acquisitions of proven reserves;

     o    exploit  our belief  that the  long-term  demand for  natural gas will
          remain  strong  by  emphasizing  natural  gas in our  acquisition  and
          drilling activities;

     o    add  natural  gas  reserves  and  increase  production  by focusing on
          various  shallow  gas plays in the Rocky  Mountain  region,  where the
          added  production  can be integrated  with our fuel  marketing  and/or
          power generation activities;

                                       7
<PAGE>

     o    increase coal  production and sales from our Wyodak mine by continuing
          to develop additional  mine-mouth  generating  facilities at the site,
          including the Wygen plant,  which is scheduled for completion in first
          quarter 2003; and

     o    pursue  future  sales of coal  from  the  Wyodak  mine to  rail-served
          customers by reducing the moisture  content of our coal so that we can
          ship it greater distances.

Exploit Our Fuel Cost Advantage and Our Operating and Marketing Expertise to
Remain a Low-Cost Power Producer. We expect to expand our portfolio of power
plants having relatively low marginal costs of producing energy and related
products and services. We intend to utilize a low-cost power production
strategy, together with access to coal and natural gas reserves, to protect our
revenue stream as an increasing number of gas-fired power plants are brought
into operation. Low marginal production costs can result from a variety of
factors, including low fuel costs, efficiency in converting fuel into energy,
and low per unit operation and maintenance costs. We have aggressively managed
each of these factors to achieve very low production costs, especially at our
coal-fired and hydroelectric generating facilities.

Our primary competitive advantage is our coal mine, which is located in close
proximity to our retail service territory. We are exploiting the competitive
advantage of this native fuel source by building additional mine-mouth
coal-fired generating capacity. This strengthens our position as a low-cost
producer since transportation costs often represent the largest component of the
delivered cost of coal.

Exploit Our Knowledge and Market Expertise While Managing the Risks Inherent in
Fuel Marketing. We aim to apply our knowledge of and expertise in the natural
gas transmission system and trading markets in the western and northwestern
regions of the United States and western Canada in order to exploit market
inefficiencies and maximize our profits in our fuel marketing businesses. Our
fuel marketing operations require effective management of price, counterparty
and operational risks. To mitigate these risks, we have implemented risk
management policies and procedures for each of our marketing companies that
establish price risk exposure levels, counterparty credit limits and committees
to monitor compliance with our policies. We also limit exposure to energy
marketing risks by maintaining separate credit facilities for each of our
marketing companies.

Build and Maintain Strong Relationships with Wholesale Energy Customers. We
strive to build strong relationships with utilities, municipalities and other
wholesale customers, who we believe will continue to be the primary providers of
electricity to retail customers in a deregulated environment. We further believe
that these entities will need products, such as capacity, in order to serve
their customers reliably. By providing these products under long-term contracts,
we are able to meet our customers' energy needs. Through this approach, we also
believe we can earn more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term
than we could by selling energy into the more volatile spot markets.

Capitalize On Our Utility's Established Market Presence, Relationships and
Customer Loyalty. As a result of its firmly established market presence, our
electric utility has built solid brand recognition and customer loyalty in the
Black Hills region. By ensuring a reliable supply of power to retail customers
in our South Dakota and Wyoming service territory at rates below the national
average, we have developed a strong, supportive relationship with our utility
regulators. Our utility provides a solid foundation of support for the expansion
of our integrated energy and communications businesses. In addition, industry,
technical and market expertise from our utility supports the growth of our
integrated energy businesses, and our strong brand recognition assists us in
achieving rapid customer acceptance of our bundled communications services in
our Black Hills service territory.

Integrated Energy

Our integrated energy group engages in the production and sale of electric power
through ownership of a diversified portfolio of generating plants, the
production of coal, natural gas and crude oil primarily in the Rocky Mountain
region, and the marketing of fuel products nationwide. Net income from the
integrated energy group exceeded net

                                       8
<PAGE>

income derived from our electric utility in 2001. We expect that earnings growth
from the integrated energy group over the next few years will be driven
primarily by our continued expansion in the power generation and oil and gas
segments. The integrated energy group consists of four segments: power
generation, oil and gas, coal mining and fuel marketing.

Power Generation. Our power generation segment acquires, develops and expands
unregulated power plants. We hold varying interests in operating independent
power plants in California, New York, Massachusetts, Wyoming, Nevada and
Colorado with a total net ownership of 593 megawatts, as well as minority
interests in several power-related funds with a net ownership interest of 24
megawatts.

Project  Development  Program.  Power generation  projects  currently under
construction include:

     o    Arapahoe CC5, a 50 megawatt  combined cycle expansion of our gas-fired
          turbines at the Arapahoe  site located in the Front Range of Colorado,
          which is expected to be placed in service in mid-2002;

     o    Las  Vegas   Cogeneration   expansion,   a  224   megawatt   gas-fired
          co-generation  power plant  project  located  near Las Vegas,  Nevada,
          which is  expected  to be placed in  service  in the third  quarter of
          2002; and

     o    Wygen,  a 90  megawatt  coal-fired  plant  under  construction  at our
          Wyodak,  Wyoming site which is expected to be operational in the first
          quarter of 2003. We will lease this plant.

We also have an active acquisition and development program through which we are
pursuing a number of additional generation projects in early stages of
development, including a coal-fired mine-mouth power plant with generating
capacity of up to 500 megawatts, to be located at our Wyodak site near Gillette,
Wyoming. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in completing any
or all of the projects currently under consideration.

How We Manage Our Portfolio. We strive to maintain diversification and balance
in our portfolio of regulated and unregulated power plants. Our portfolio
(including plants currently operating and those under construction) is
diversified in terms of fuel mix and geographic location, with 87 percent of net
unregulated capacity being gas-fired, 9 percent coal-fired, and the remainder
hydroelectric. Our independent power plants are located in California, Wyoming,
Colorado, Nevada, New York and Massachusetts. In contrast, our electric utility
capacity is approximately 50 percent coal-fired, 38 percent oil or gas-fired,
and 12 percent under purchased power contracts, with plants located in South
Dakota and Wyoming.

We also have a diversified mix of revenue sources. We typically sell two types
of products: energy and capacity, including ancillary services. Although these
are separate products, both are typically sold together. Energy refers to the
actual electricity generated by our facilities for ultimate transmission and
distribution to consumers of electricity. Energy is the only one of our products
that is subsequently distributed to consumers. Capacity refers to the physical
capability of a facility to produce energy. Ancillary services generally are
capacity support products used to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the
electric power supply system. Examples of ancillary services include:

     o    automatic  generation control,  which is used to balance energy supply
          with  energy  demand,  referred  to in our  industry  as  "load," on a
          real-time basis; and

     o    operating  reserves,  which are used on an  hourly  or daily  basis to
          generate  additional energy if demand increases or if major generating
          resources   go  off-line   or  if   transmission   facilities   become
          unavailable.

Our output is sold under contracts of varying length and subject to merchant
pricing, thereby allowing us to take advantage of current favorable price
trends, while hedging the impact of a potential downturn in prices in the
future. We currently sell energy and capacity under a combination of short- and
long-term contracts as well as direct sales into the merchant energy markets.
Currently, we sell approximately 90 percent of our unregulated generating
capacity

                                       9
<PAGE>


in operation under contracts greater than one year in duration. We sell
the remainder of this capacity under short-term contracts or directly into the
merchant markets. Substantially all of the energy and capacity to be generated
by our projects under construction is also under long-term contracts.

How We Develop and Acquire Power Plants. We plan to actively pursue power plant
acquisitions and development opportunities in areas we view as attractive
throughout North America. Our current focus has been, and is likely to remain,
in the North American Reliability Council region known as the Western Systems
Coordinating Council, or "WSCC." Among those factors we consider critical in
evaluating the relative attractiveness of new generation opportunities are the
following:

     o    electric demand growth potential in the targeted region;

     o    requirements for permitting and siting;

     o    proximity  of  the  proposed  site  to  high   transmission   capacity
          corridors;

     o    fuel supply reliability and pricing;

     o    the local regulatory environment; and

     o    the potential to exploit market  expertise and operating  efficiencies
          relating  to  geographic  concentration  of new  generation  with  our
          existing power plant portfolio.

Our goal is to sell approximately 80 percent of the independent power generation
portfolio under long-term contracts, while leaving the remainder available for
merchant, or "spot" sales. We aim to secure long-term power sales contracts in
conjunction with project financing. This enables us to minimize our liability
and to design a debt repayment schedule to closely match the term of the power
sales contracts so that at the end of the contract term, the debt has largely
been repaid.

Independent Power Plants

General. Power facilities are often classified by cost of production. Facilities
that have the lowest costs of production relative to other power plants in the
region are usually the facilities that are first used to provide energy. These
plants are known as "baseload" facilities and typically operate more than 60
percent of the time they are available. Our hydroelectric assets in New York and
the Wygen coal-fired facility under construction in Wyoming are examples of
low-cost, baseload plants.

As demand for electricity rises during the year or even during the course of a
day, power plants that have higher costs of production are dispatched to supply
additional energy. Facilities that regularly provide additional energy during a
day and that are typically used between 10 percent and 60 percent of the time
are known as "intermediate" facilities.

Power plants with the highest costs of production are called upon only in times
of exceptionally high demand and are known as "peaking units." Peaking units are
generally dispatched less than 10 percent of the time they are available.

Rocky Mountain and West Coast Facilities. We own approximately 525 megawatts of
generating capacity in the WSCC states of California, Colorado, Nevada and
Wyoming, and are in the process of constructing or acquiring another 364
megawatts in the region. All of these facilities in operation are gas-fired,
with all but our Harbor Cogeneration facility in California operating under
long-term power purchase or tolling agreements whereby the purchaser assumes the
fuel risk. The Harbor Cogeneration facility currently operates as a merchant
peaking plant selling ancillary services and energy into the California market.

Arapahoe, Valmont and Fountain Valley Facilities

In Operation: Our Fountain Valley, Arapahoe and Valmont plants are wholly-owned
gas-fired peaking facilities in the Front Range of Colorado, with a total
capacity of 400 megawatts, including 280 megawatts which became operational
during the summer of 2001. We sell all of the output from these plants to Public
Service Company of Colorado under tolling contracts expiring in May 2012. These
contracts also cover the Arapahoe expansion project described below.

Under Construction:  We expect to increase our capacity by 50 megawatts at the
Arapahoe plant by mid 2002.

Las Vegas Cogeneration Facility

In Operation: Las Vegas Cogeneration, is a 53 megawatt, gas-fired plant
northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of the power from this plant is sold to
Nevada Power under a long-term contract that expires in 2024. We own 50 percent
of this plant, however under generally accepted accounting principles, we
consolidate 100 percent.

Under Construction/Expansion: We are currently expanding the Las Vegas
Cogeneration facility by an additional 224 megawatts. The expansion is expected
to become fully operational during the third quarter of 2002. The power
generated by the expansion will be sold under a long-term contract with
Allegheny Energy Supply L.L.C. that expires in 2017. We own 100 percent of the
expansion project.

Wygen Facility

Under Construction: The Wygen facility is a leased mine-mouth coal-fired plant
with a total capacity of 90 megawatts, which is expected to be completed by
first quarter 2003. The Wygen plant will be substantially identical in design to
our electric utility's Neil Simpson II facility, completed in 1995. The plants
will run on pulverized low-sulfur coal fed by conveyor from our adjacent Wyodak
mine. The plant will burn approximately

                                       11
<PAGE>


500,000 tons of coal per year, and will use the latest available environmental
control technology. We intend to sell the majority of the power from the
facility under long-term unit contingent capacity and energy sales contracts,
under which delivery is not required during plant outages. We have entered into
a contract to sell 60 megawatts of unit contingent capacity from this plant to
Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power Company with a term of 10 years from the date the
plant becomes operational. We have also signed a contract to sell an additional
20 megawatts of unit contingent capacity and energy to the Municipal Electric
Agency of Nebraska for a term of 10 years.

Gillette CT

The Gillette CT facility, a gas-fired combustion turbine facility located at the
same site as our Wygen plant, has a total capacity of 40 megawatts and became
operational in May 2001. The energy and capacity from this facility is sold to
Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power Company under a 10-year tolling agreement.

Ontario Cogeneration Facility

Ontario Cogeneration Company is a 12 megawatt, gas-fired power plant in Ontario,
California, which is currently being operated as a baseload plant. Electrical
output from the plant is subject to a 25-year power purchase agreement with
Southern California Edison, which expires in January 2010. The project also
sells all of its steam production to Sunkist Growers, Inc. under a five-year
agreement, which terminates in November 2002. For a description of certain
issues relating to our operation of this plant, see "--Regulation--Environmental
Regulation--Clean Air Act."

Harbor Cogeneration Facility

Harbor Cogeneration, a gas-fired plant located in Wilmington, California, is
currently being operated as a merchant peaking plant selling ancillary services
and energy into the California Independent System Operator, or "CAISO," market.
It formerly operated under a 30-year power purchase agreement with Edison
Mission Energy. This contract was terminated in February 1999 under a settlement
agreement with Southern California Edison. Under the buyout agreement, Harbor
Cogeneration will receive payments pursuant to a termination payment schedule
for an amount equal to the total payment under the original contract due for the
11-year period beginning April 1, 1997 and ending on October 1, 2008. During
2001, we completed an expansion of the Harbor Cogeneration plant adding 18
megawatts (10 megawatt net ownership interest). The plant has sold the peaking
capacity from its expansion to the CAISO for the peak summer periods of 2001
through 2003 under an agreement that provides for payments to us of
approximately $0.6 million per year of the contract. We plan to sell the
remaining capacity and all of the energy from this plant in the California
market on a merchant basis.

Northeast Facilities. We currently own approximately 68 net megawatts of
generation capacity in eight plants in the Northeast region, all of which are
located in New York and Massachusetts. Fifty-nine percent of this generation is
"run-of-river" hydroelectric, with the remainder being gas-fired peaking
capacity.

Adirondack Hydro Development

     The seven "run-of-river" hydroelectric plant interests are:

     o    New York State Dam, an 11.4  megawatt  plant  located in Waterford and
          Cohoes, New York;

     o    Middle Falls, a 2.3 megawatt plant located in Easton, New York;

     o    Sissonville, a 3.0 megawatt plant located in Potsdam, New York;

     o    Warrensburg, a 2.9 megawatt plant located in Warrensburg, New York;

     o    Hudson Falls, a 41.9 megawatt plant located in Moreau, New York;

     o    South Glens Falls, a 13.9 megawatt plant located in South Glens Falls,
          New York; and

     o    Fourth Branch, a 3.4 megawatt plant located in Waterford, New York.

The seven projects were initially covered by long-term power purchase contracts
with Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation for all or most of their output.
Currently, four projects have been restructured to allow the power purchase
contracts to be bought out and for us eventually to sell power into the New York
Independent System Operator (ISO). The New York State Dam, Sissonville, Fourth
Branch and Warrensburg facilities are currently subject to short-term transition
power sales agreements expiring in 2002 and 2003, at which point these plants
will sell directly into the market on a merchant basis. The remaining three New
York plants, Hudson Falls, South Glens Falls and Middle Falls, continue to
operate under long-term power purchase agreements with Niagara Mohawk.

Pepperell Facility

The Pepperell facility is a 40 megawatt gas-fired combined-cycle plant located
in Pepperell, Massachusetts. The plant has capacity contracts covering 2002 and
sells merchant wholesale energy into the New England ISO. The facility also has
a steam sales agreement with the Pepperell Paper Company expiring in December
2002.

</TABLE>

Financing of Our Independent Power Projects. We have financed our principal
independent power generation facilities primarily with non-recourse debt that is
repaid solely from the project's revenues. This type of financing is referred to
as "project financing." These financings generally are secured by the physical
assets, major project contracts and agreements, cash accounts and, in certain
cases, our ownership interest, in the related project. True project financing is
not available for all projects, including some assets purchased out of
bankruptcy, some merchant plants and some purchases of minority stock positions
in publicly traded companies. Even in those instances, however, we may still be
able to finance a smaller portion of the total cost with project financing, with
the remainder financed with debt that is either raised or supported at the
corporate rather than the project level.

Project financing transactions generally are structured so that all revenues of
a project are deposited directly with a bank or other financial institution
acting as escrow or security deposit agent. These funds then are payable in a
specified order of priority set forth in the financing documents to ensure that,
to the extent available, they are used first to pay operating expenses, senior
debt service and taxes and to fund reserve accounts. Thereafter, subject to
satisfying debt service coverage ratios and certain other conditions, available
funds may be disbursed for management fees or dividends or, where there are
subordinated lenders, to the payment of subordinated debt service.

These project financing structures are designed to prevent the lenders from
relying on us or our other projects for repayment; that is, they are
"non-recourse" to us and our affiliates not involved in the project, unless we
or another affiliate expressly agree to undertake liability. In the event of a
foreclosure after a default, our project affiliate owning the facility would
only retain an interest in the assets, if any, remaining after all debts and
obligations were paid. In addition, the debt of each operating project may
reduce the liquidity of our equity interest in that project because the interest
is typically subject both to a pledge securing the project's debt and to
transfer restrictions set forth in the relevant financing agreements. Also, our
ability to transfer or sell our interest in certain projects or the project's
power is restricted by certain purchase options or rights of first refusal in
favor of our partners and certain change of control restrictions in the project
financing documents.

We may also choose to finance these projects from time to time by other means
including using our short-term credit facilities on an interim basis.

Fuel Production

Coal

Our coal production segment mines and processes low-sulfur sub-bituminous coal
near Gillette, Wyoming. The Wyodak mine, which we acquired in 1956 from
Homestake Gold Mining Company, is located in the Powder River Basin, one of the
largest coal reserves in the United States. We believe the Wyodak mine is the
oldest operating surface coal mine in the nation, with an annual production of
approximately 3.5 million tons. Mining rights to the coal are based on four
federal leases and one state lease. We pay royalties of 12.5 percent and 9.0
percent,

                                       14
<PAGE>

respectively, of the selling price on all federal and state coal. As of
December 31, 2001, we had coal reserves of 276.6 million tons, enough to satisfy
present contracts for approximately 70 years. Substantially all of our coal
production is currently sold under long-term contracts to Black Hills Power,
Inc., our electric utility, and to PacifiCorp.

Our coal segment's agreement with Black Hills Power limits earnings from all
coal sales to Black Hills Power to a specified return on our original cost
depreciated investment base. Black Hills Power made a commitment to the South
Dakota Public Utilities Commission, the Wyoming Public Service Commission and
the City of Gillette that coal would be furnished and priced as provided by that
agreement for the life of our Neil Simpson II plant.

The price for unprocessed coal sold to PacifiCorp for its 80 percent interest in
the Wyodak Plant is determined by a coal supply agreement terminating in 2022.
This is a new agreement that began January 1, 2001 and was part of a litigation
settlement with PacifiCorp.

Over the next several years, we expect to increase coal production to supply:

     o    the Wygen 90 megawatt  mine-mouth power plant,  which is scheduled for
          completion in 2003;

     o    additional  mine mouth  generating  capacity of up to 500 megawatts at
          the same site as the  Wygen  plant,  which is in the  early  stages of
          development; and

     o    future sales of coal to rail-served customers.

In addition, if our coal enhancement K-Fuel plant is re-started, we expect to
increase production from the Wyodak mine and market any low-moisture, high-heat
content coal we produce to an expanded customer base.

Natural Gas and Crude Oil

Our oil and gas exploration and production segment operates approximately 385
oil and gas wells, all of which are located in Wyoming, Colorado and Nebraska.
The majority of these wells are in the Finn-Shurley Field area, located in
Weston and Niobrara Counties in Wyoming. We also own a working interest in, but
do not operate, an additional 428 wells located in California, Montana,
Louisiana, Colorado, North Dakota, Texas, Wyoming, Oklahoma and offshore in the
Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we have accumulated significant acreage in the
Rocky Mountain region, which we plan to utilize for oil and gas exploration.

We plan to substantially increase our natural gas reserves and minimize
exploration risk by focusing on lower-risk exploration and development drilling
and acquisitions of proven producing properties. A key component of this
strategy is the pursuit of shallow gas opportunities in the Rocky Mountain
region. We also expect to modestly increase our Mid-continent area production in
the future but do not plan to serve as the operator for those production
activities.

As of December 31, 2001, we had proved reserves of 4.0 million barrels of oil
and 24.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas, with approximately 63 percent of
current production consisting of natural gas. In 2001, our oil and gas
production increased 38 percent over 2000 levels, with strong drilling results,
acquisitions and year-end reserves.

In April 2001, we purchased certain operating and non-operating interests in 74
oil and gas wells located primarily in Colorado and Wyoming from Stewart
Petroleum Corporation. These properties added to our proved reserves
approximately 8.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas and approximately 200,000
barrels of oil.

Fuel Marketing. We market natural gas, oil and coal in specific regions of the
United States. We offer physical and financial wholesale fuel marketing and
price risk management products and services to a variety of customers. These
customers include natural gas distribution companies, municipalities, industrial
users, oil and gas producers, electric

                                       15
<PAGE>

utilities, coal mines, energy marketers and retail gas users. Our average daily
marketing volumes for the year ended December 31, 2001, were 1,047,700 million
British thermal units of gas, 36,500 barrels of oil and 6,100 tons of coal.

Gas Marketing

Our natural gas marketing operations are headquartered in Golden, Colorado, with
a satellite office in Calgary, Canada. Our gas marketing operations focus
primarily on wholesale marketing and producer marketing services. Producer
services include providing for direct purchases of wellhead gas and for risk
transfer and hedging products. Our gas marketing efforts are concentrated in the
Rocky Mountain and West Coast regions and in Western Canada, which are areas in
which we believe we have a competitive advantage due to our knowledge of local
markets. We contractually hold natural gas storage capacity and both long and
short-term transportation capacity on several major pipelines in the western
United States and Canada. We utilize this capacity to move relatively low cost
natural gas from the producer regions to more expensive end-use market areas.

Oil Marketing and Transportation

Our crude oil marketing and transportation operations are headquartered in
Houston, Texas and are concentrated primarily in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.
At December 31, 2001 we owned a 33 percent interest in Millennium Pipeline
Company, L.P., which owns and operates a 200-mile pipeline. In March 2002, we
acquired the remaining 67 percent interest in Millennium. The pipeline has a
capacity of approximately 65,000 barrels of oil per day, and transports imported
crude oil from Beaumont, Texas to Longview, Texas, which is the transfer point
to connecting carriers. We also acquired additional ownership interest in
Millennium Terminal Company, L.P., which has 1.1 million barrels of crude oil
storage connected to the Millennium Pipeline at the Oil Tanking terminal in
Beaumont. The Millennium system is presently operating near capacity through
shipper agreements. These acquisitions give us 100 percent ownership in the
Millennium companies.

Coal Marketing

We market coal to various industrial customers and power plants located
primarily in the Midwest and eastern regions of the United States through our
coal marketing subsidiary, Black Hills Coal Network. We formed Black Hills Coal
Network in 1998 to acquire the assets and hire the operational management of
Coal Network and Coal Niche, based in Mason, Ohio. These predecessor companies
were coal brokerage and agency companies with customers located primarily east
of the Mississippi River.

Electric Utility - Black Hills Power, Inc.

Our electric utility, Black Hills Power, is engaged in the generation,
transmission and distribution of electricity. It provides a solid foundation of
revenues, earnings and cash flow that support utility capital expenditures,
dividends, and overall performance and growth.

Distribution and Transmission. Our electric utility distribution and
transmission businesses serve approximately 59,200 electric customers, with an
electric transmission system of 447 miles of high voltage lines and 541 miles of
lower voltage lines. In addition, we jointly own 43 miles of high voltage lines
with Basin Electric Cooperative. Our utility's service territory covers a 9,300
square mile area of western South Dakota, eastern Wyoming and southeastern
Montana with a strong and stable economic base. Over 90 percent of our utility's
retail electric revenues are generated in South Dakota.

The following are characteristics of our distribution and transmission
businesses:

     o    We have a diverse  customer and revenue base.  Our revenue mix in 2001
          is  comprised of 22 percent  commercial,  17 percent  residential,  11
          percent industrial, 8 percent long-term contract wholesale, 10 percent
          short-term contract wholesale,  31 percent wholesale  off-system sales
          and 1  percent  municipal.  Approximately  65  percent  of  our  large
          commercial  and  industrial   customers  are  provided  service  under
          long-term contracts. We have historically optimized the utilization of
          our  power  supply  resources  by  selling  wholesale  power  to other
          utilities  and to power  marketers  in the  spot  market  and  through
          short-term sales contracts.

     o    In 1999,  the South Dakota Public  Utilities  Commission  extended our
          previous retail rate freeze for another five-years, through January 1,
          2005. The rate freeze  preserves our low-cost rate structure at levels
          below the national  average for our retail customers while allowing us
          to  retain  the  benefits   from  cost  savings  and  from   wholesale
          "off-system"  sales,  which are not covered by the rate  freeze.  This
          provides us with flexibility in allocating our generating  capacity to
          maximize returns in changing market environments.

     o    Forty-one percent of our electric revenues for the year ended December
          31, 2001  consisted of off-system and  short-term  contract  wholesale
          sales  compared to 29 percent in 2000 and 8 percent in 1999.  Although
          the demand for power in the western  markets has eased from the record
          levels seen in the first half of 2001, further increases in the volume
          of off-system sales are expected in the future due to demand growth in
          the Rocky Mountain  region and the early 2002 addition of 40 megawatts
          of gas-fired generating capacity.

     o    Our system has the  capability  of connecting to either the eastern or
          western  transmission  systems,  which provides us with access between
          the WSCC  region  and the  Mid-Continent  Area Power  Pool,  or "MAPP"
          region.  This allows us the opportunity to improve system  reliability
          and  take  advantage  of power  price  differentials  between  the two
          electric  grids. We are able to interconnect up to 80 megawatts of our
          generation  into  the  MAPP.  Alternatively,  we  can  have  up  to 80
          megawatts  of our load  served  from the MAPP  region.  The  available
          transmission  capacity of the MAPP transmission  system determines how
          much  of  this  80   megawatts   can  be  served   from  the   eastern
          interconnection.

     o    We have firm  transmission  access to  deliver up to 60  megawatts  of
          power on  PacifiCorp's  system to  wholesale  customers in the western
          region during 2002, scheduled to decline to 50 megawatts by 2004.

On October 15, 2000, we indicated to FERC our intent to participate in a
regional transmission organization, or RTO. Our transmission system is a part of
the western transmission grid governed by the WSCC, and it interconnects with
transmission systems operated by the Western Area Power Administration, or WAPA,
and by PacifiCorp. WAPA continues to evaluate participation in the RTOs which
will involve transmission systems in Colorado and the southwest region, while
PacifiCorp is involved in the development of the RTO West which will involve
transmission

                                       17
<PAGE>

systems in Wyoming and the northwest region. We will continue to
monitor the development of these two RTOs and decide in the future which RTO
best fits our transmission system and operations.

Power Sales Agreements. We sell approximately 50 percent of our utility's
current load under long-term contracts. Our key contracts include a 10-year
contract expiring in 2007 with Montana-Dakota Utilities Company for the sale of
up to 55 megawatts of energy and capacity to service the Sheridan, Wyoming
electric service territory, and a contract with the City of Gillette, Wyoming,
expiring in 2012, to provide the city's first 23 megawatts of capacity and
energy. Both contracts are integrated into our control system and are treated as
firm native load. In May 2001, we began selling 30 megawatts of firm capacity
and energy up to the contract capacity to Public Service Company of Colorado for
a period through 2004. We have entered into an agreement with the Municipal
Electric Agency of Nebraska for the sale of 30 megawatts of unit contingent
energy and capacity for a period through the completion of construction of the
Wygen independent power facility, which is expected in first quarter 2003. For
the 10-year period beginning with the completion of the Wygen facility, our
utility and our power generation segment will each provide 20 megawatts of unit
contingent energy and capacity to the Municipal Electric Agency of Nebraska.

Our utility's electric load is served by coal-, oil- and natural gas-fired
generating units providing 395 megawatts of generation capacity and from the
following purchased power and capacity contracts with PacifiCorp:

     o    a power sales agreement expiring in 2023, involving the purchase by us
          of 60 megawatts of baseload power in 2002, and scheduled to decline to
          50 megawatts by 2004;

     o    a reserve capacity integration agreement expiring in 2012, which makes
          available to us 100 megawatts of reserve  capacity in connection  with
          the utilization of the Ben French CT units; and

     o    a capacity option call,  which gives us an option to purchase up to 60
          megawatts of peaking capacity seasonally through March 31, 2007.

Regulated Power Plants. Since 1995, our utility has been a net producer of
energy. Our utility owns 395 megawatts of generating capacity with an additional
40 megawatts under construction, all of which is located in the Rocky Mountain
region. Our utility's peak system load of 392 megawatts was reached in August
2001. None of our generation is restricted by hours of operation, thereby
providing us with the ability to generate power to meet demand whenever
necessary and feasible.

Ben French

Ben French is a wholly owned coal-fired plant situated in Rapid City, South
Dakota, with a capacity of 25 megawatts. This plant was put into service in 1960
and has since been operating as a baseload plant. Coal for the plant is
purchased from our Wyodak mine and delivered by truck.

Ben French Diesel Units 1-5

The Ben French Diesel Units 1-5 are wholly owned diesel-fired plants located in
Rapid City, South Dakota, with a capacity of 10 megawatts. These plants were put
into service in 1965, and are being operated as peaking plants.

Ben French CT's 1-4

The Ben French Combustion Turbines 1-4 are wholly owned gas and oil-fired units
with a capacity of 100 megawatts located in Rapid City, South Dakota. These
facilities were put into service from 1977 to 1979, and are being operated as
peaking units.

Neil Simpson I and II

Neil Simpson I and II are air-cooled, coal-fired wholly owned facilities located
near Gillette, Wyoming. Neil Simpson I has a capacity of 21.8 megawatts and was
put into service in 1969. Neil Simpson II has a capacity of 91.0 megawatts and
was put into service in 1995. These plants are operated as baseload facilities,
and are mine-mouth coal-supplied plants, receiving their coal directly from our
Wyodak mine.

Neil Simpson CT

The Neil Simpson Combustion Turbine is a wholly owned gas-fired plant located
near Gillette, Wyoming with a capacity of 40 megawatts. This plant was put into
service in 2000, and was installed to provide peaking capabilities.

                                       19
<PAGE>


Osage

The Osage plant is a wholly owned coal-fired plant in Osage, Wyoming with a
total capacity of 34.5 megawatts and was put into service from 1948 to 1952.
This plant has three turbine generation units, and is being operated as a
baseload plant. Coal for the plant is purchased from our Wyodak mine and
delivered by truck.

Wyodak

Wyodak is a 362 megawatt mine mouth coal-fired plant owned jointly by PacifiCorp
and us and in which we hold a 20 percent (72.4 net megawatt) ownership interest.
Our Wyodak mine furnishes all the coal fuel supply for the Wyodak plant. The
plant was put into service in 1978, and is currently being operated as a
baseload plant.

Lange CT

The Lange Combustion Turbine is a wholly owned 40 megawatt gas-fired plant under
construction near Rapid City, South Dakota. The plant is expected to be placed
in service early 2002. The Lange Project was originally planned as an
independent power plant, but is being constructed by our utility as a regulated
power plant to provide peaking capacity and voltage support for the area.

Communications

Our communications group, whose primary business is Black Hills FiberCom, was
formed to provide state-of-the-art broadband telecommunications services to the
underserved markets of Rapid City and the northern Black Hills of South Dakota.
We offer residential and business customers a full suite of telecommunications
services, including local and long distance telephone service, expanded cable
television service, cable modem Internet access and high speed data and video
services. We have completed a 242-mile inter- and intra-city fiber optic network
and currently operate 737 miles of two-way interactive hybrid fiber coaxial or
"HFC" cable. We believe we are one of the first companies in the United States
to provide video entertainment service, high-speed Internet access, and local
and long distance telephone services over an advanced broadband infrastructure.
We have bundled these services into value packages with a single consolidated
bill for all of these services.

We introduced our broadband communications services to the Rapid City and
northern Black Hills areas in November 1999. As of December 31, 2001, we had
attracted 15,660 residential customers and 2,250 business customers. Our goal is
to attain 60 percent residential and commercial market penetration within our
service territory.

The construction of our communications network is approximately 85 percent
complete and we expect to substantially complete construction of the base
network in 2002.

Competition

The independent power, fuel production and fuel marketing industries are
characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, some of which may have
more extensive operating experience, larger staffs or greater financial
resources than us. In particular, the independent power industry in recent years
has been characterized by increased competition for asset purchases and
development opportunities.

In addition, Congress has considered various pieces of legislation to
restructure the electric industry that would require, among other things,
customer choice and/or repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,
or PUHCA. The debate is likely to continue and perhaps intensify. The effect of
enacting such legislation cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty.
Industry deregulation may encourage the disaggregation of vertically integrated
utilities into separate generation, transmission and distribution businesses. As
a result of these potential regulatory changes, significant additional
competitors could become active in the generation segment of our industry.

                                       20
<PAGE>



Our communications unit faces competition from numerous well established
companies, including Qwest Communications, Rapid City's incumbent local exchange
carrier, Midcontinent Communications, the area's incumbent cable television
provider, as well as long distance providers and Internet service providers. Our
success in this business will depend upon, among other things, the quality of
our customer service, the willingness of residential and business customers to
accept us as an alternative provider of broadband communications services, our
products and services and our ability to offer an attractive package of bundled
products.

Risk Management

Our fuel marketing operations require effective risk management of price,
counterparty performance and operational risks. Price risk is created through
the volatility of energy prices. Counterparty performance risk is the risk that
a counterparty will fail to satisfy its contractual obligations to us, and
includes credit risk. Operational risk arises from a lack of internal controls.
We have implemented controls to mitigate each of these risks.

Our fuel marketing operations are conducted in accordance with guidelines
established through separate risk management policies and procedures for each
marketing company and through our credit policy. These policies are established
and approved by our board of directors, reviewed on a regular basis and
monitored as described below.

We maintain a working risk management committee for each of our marketing
companies, and a credit committee at the parent company level. The risk
management committees focus on implementation of risk management procedures and
on monitoring compliance with established policies. The credit committee sets
counterparty credit limits, monitors credit exposure levels and reviews
compliance with established credit policies. Additionally, we employ a risk
manager and a credit manager responsible for overseeing these functions.

Our risk management policies and procedures specify maximum price risk exposure
levels within which each respective marketing company must operate. These
policies and procedures establish relatively low exposure levels and generally
prohibit speculative trading strategies.

As part of our enterprise-wide risk management strategy, we limit our exposure
to energy marketing risks by maintaining separate credit facilities within each
of our fuel marketing companies. These credit facilities have security interests
solely against the assets of the respective marketing company, with the
exception of a $1 million guarantee by our coal mining subsidiary on our coal
marketing unit's credit facility.

A significant potential risk related to power sales is the price risk arising
from the sale of wholesale power that exceeds our generating capacity. Short
positions can arise from unplanned plant outages or from unanticipated load
demands. To control such risks, we restrict wholesale off-system sales to
amounts by which our anticipated generation capabilities exceed our anticipated
load requirements plus a required reserve margin. We further control this risk
by selling only in the day-ahead power market and by entering into longer-term
sales contracts that are made on a "unit contingent" basis, under which delivery
is not required during unplanned outages at specified power plants.

Regulation

We are subject to a broad range of federal, state and local energy and
environmental laws and regulations applicable to the development, ownership and
operation of our projects. These laws and regulations generally require that a
wide variety of permits and other approvals be obtained before construction or
operation of a power plant commences and that, after completion, the facility
operate in compliance with their requirements. We strive to comply with the
terms of all such laws, regulations, permits and licenses and believe that all
of our operating plants are in material compliance with all such applicable
requirements.

                                       21

Energy Regulation

Federal Power Act. The Federal Power Act gives FERC exclusive ratemaking
jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of
electricity in interstate commerce. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, all
public utilities subject to FERC's jurisdiction are required to file rate
schedules with FERC prior to commencement of wholesale sales or interstate
transmission of electricity. Public utilities with cost-based rate schedules are
also subject to accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements
administered by FERC.

The Energy Policy Act. The passage of the Energy Policy Act in 1992 further
encouraged independent power production by providing certain exemptions from
regulation for exempt wholesale generators, or EWGs. All of our subsidiaries
that would otherwise be treated as public utilities are currently treated as
EWGs under the Energy Policy Act. An EWG is an entity that is exclusively
engaged, directly or indirectly, in the business of owning or operating
facilities that are exclusively engaged in generation and selling electric
energy at wholesale. An EWG will not be regulated under PUHCA, but is subject to
FERC and state public utility commission regulatory reviews, including rate
approval. Since EWGs are only allowed to sell power at wholesale, their rates
must receive initial approval from FERC rather than the states. All of our EWGs
to date that have sought rate approval from FERC have been granted market-based
rate authority, which allows FERC to waive certain accounting, record-keeping
and reporting requirements imposed on public utilities with cost-based rates.
However, FERC customarily reserves the right to suspend, upon complaint,
market-based rate authority on a prospective basis if it is subsequently
determined that we or any of our EWGs exercised market power. If FERC were to
suspend market-based rate authority, it would most likely be necessary to file,
and obtain FERC acceptance of, cost-based rate schedules for any of our EWGs.
Also, the loss of market-based rate authority would subject the EWGs to the
accounting, record keeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on public
utilities with cost-based rate schedules.

In addition, if there occurs a "material change" in facts that might affect any
of our subsidiaries' eligibility for EWG status, within 60 days of the material
change, the relevant EWG must (1) file a written explanation of why the material
change does not affect its EWG status, (2) file a new application for EWG
status, or (3) notify FERC that it no longer wishes to maintain EWG status. If
any of our subsidiaries were to lose EWG status, we, along with our affiliates,
would be subject to regulation under PUHCA as a public utility company. Absent a
substantial restructuring of our business, it would be difficult for us to
comply with PUHCA without a material adverse effect on our business.

State Energy Regulation. In areas outside of wholesale rate regulation (such as
financial or organizational regulation), some state utility laws may give their
public utility commissions broad jurisdiction over steam sales or EWGs that sell
power in their service territories. The actual scope of the jurisdiction over
steam or independent power projects depends on state law and varies
significantly from state to state.

Environmental Regulation

The construction and operation of power projects are subject to extensive
environmental protection and land use regulation in the United States. These
laws and regulations often require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining
licenses, permits and approvals from federal, state and local agencies. If such
laws and regulations are changed and our facilities are not grandfathered,
extensive modifications to project technologies and facilities could be
required.

General. Based on current trends, we expect that environmental and land use
regulation will continue to be stringent. Accordingly, we actively review
proposed construction projects that could subject us to stringent pollution
controls imposed on "major modifications," as defined under the Clean Air Act,
and changes in "discharge characteristics," as defined under the Clean Water
Act. The goal of these actions is to achieve compliance with applicable
regulations, administrative consent orders and variances from applicable
air-quality related regulations.

                                       22
<PAGE>


Clean Air Act. Our Neil Simpson II, Neil Simpson CT, Gillette CT, the Arapahoe,
Valmont, Fountain Valley, Lange CT and Wyodak plants are all subject to Title IV
of the Clean Air Act, which requires certain fossil-fuel-fired combustion
devices to hold sulfur dioxide "allowances" for each ton of sulfur dioxide
emitted. We currently hold sufficient allowances credited to us as a result of
sulfur removal equipment previously installed at the Wyodak plant to apply to
the operation of all units subject to Title IV through 2031 without requiring
the purchase of any additional allowances. With respect to any future plants, we
plan to comply with the need for holding the appropriate number of allowances by
reducing sulfur dioxide emissions through the use of low sulfur fuels,
installation of "back end" control technology and if necessary, the purchase of
allowances on the open market. We expect to integrate the costs of obtaining the
required number of allowances needed for future projects into our overall
financial analysis of such projects.

On July 14, 2000, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, known as
SCAQMD, sent a letter to our affiliate, Black Hills Ontario, L.L.C., the
operator of a 12 megawatt natural-gas fired co-generation facility located in
Ontario, California, stating that the SCAQMD had determined, as a result of a
facility audit completed for the compliance year ended June 1, 1999, that the
facility's nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emissions were 28,958 pounds over the
facility's NOx allocation established by the SCAQMD's RECLAIM emissions trading
program. As a result, the SCAQMD indicated that it would be reducing the
facility's NOx allocation by the same number of allowances for the compliance
year subsequent to a final determination on this issue. Black Hills Ontario
provided documentation to the SCAQMD disputing this proposed reduction and by
letter on August 14, 2001, the SCAQMD agreed that Ontario had not exceeded its
NOx allocation and stated the issue is now resolved. Black Hills Ontario was
able to purchase NOx allowances for the 2001-2002 compliance period and projects
that it will need to continue purchasing NOx allowances for all future
compliance years. Annual purchases are anticipated to be approximately 30,000
allowances. There is currently significant volatility in the price and supply of
RECLAIM NOx allowances; although the SCAQMD has proposed a revision to its
regulations to stabilize the RECLAIM market, it is unclear whether these rules
will mitigate Black Hills Ontario's potential exposure for its projected
allowance shortfall. Accordingly, no assurance can be given at this time
regarding whether RECLAIM NOx allowances will be available for purchase to allow
Black Hills Ontario to comply with RECLAIM requirements for the year ended June
30, 2002, or, if allowances are available, as to the cost of those allowances.

In July 1999, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized
rules designed to protect and improve visibility impairment resulting from air
emissions. Among other things, the regulations required states to identify
sources of emissions (including certain coal-fired generating units built
between 1962 and 1977) by 2004 that would be subject to "Best Available Retrofit
Technology," known as BART. These sources would be required to implement BART
within five years after the EPA approved state plans adopted to combat
visibility impairment. The submission of these plans is due between 2004 and
2008. In January 2001, the EPA proposed guidance to assist states in determining
which sources should be subject to the BART requirement. That guidance is
currently under review by the Whitehouse Office of Management and Budget and is
expected to be final in 2002. Management believes that the only existing plant
which may be required to comply with Clean Air Act requirements is our Neil
Simpson I plant and that any capital expenditures associated with bringing the
plant into compliance would not have a material adverse effect on our financial
position or results of operations.

Title V of the Clean Air Act imposes federal requirements, which dictate that
all of our fossil fuel-fired generation facilities must obtain operating
permits. All of our existing facilities subject to this requirement are in the
process of or have submitted Title V permit applications and either have
received or are in the process of receiving permits.

On November 3, 1999, the United States Department of Justice filed suit against
a number of electric utilities for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act's
"new source review" requirements related to modifications of air emissions
sources at electric generating stations located in the southern and Midwestern
regions of the United States. Several states have joined these lawsuits. In
addition, the EPA has also issued administrative notices of violation alleging
similar violations at additional power plants owned by some of the same
utilities named as defendants in the Department of Justice lawsuit, and also
issued an administrative order to the Tennessee Valley Authority for similar
violations at some of its power plants. The EPA has also issued requests for
information pursuant to the Clean Air

                                       23
<PAGE>

Act to numerous other electric utilities seeking to determine whether those
utilities also engaged in activities that may have been in violation of the
Clean Air Act's new source review requirements. No such proceedings have been
initiated or requests for information issued with respect to any of our
facilities, but there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to similar
proceedings in the future.

In December 2000, the EPA announced its intention to regulate mercury emissions
from coal-fired and oil-fired electric power plants under Section 112 of the
Clean Air Act. The EPA is committed to proposing a rule to regulate such
emissions by no later than 2003. Because we do not know what the EPA may require
with respect to this issue, we are not able to evaluate the impact of potential
mercury regulations on the operation of our facilities.

Since the adoption of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change in 1992,
there has been worldwide attention with respect to greenhouse gas emissions. In
December 1997, the Clinton administration participated in the Kyoto, Japan
negotiations, where the basis of a climate change treaty was formulated. Under
the treaty, known as the Kyoto Protocol, the United States would be required,
between 2008 and 2012 to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 7 percent from
1990 levels. However, because of opposition to the treaty in the United States
Senate, the Kyoto Protocol has not been submitted to the Senate for
ratification. Although legislative developments on the state level related to
controlling greenhouse gas emissions have occurred, we are not aware of any
similar developments in the states in which we operate. If the United States
ratifies the Kyoto Protocol or we otherwise become subject to limitations on
emissions of carbon dioxide from our plants, these requirements could have a
significant impact on our operations. In March 2001, the Bush administration
announced that it would not seek to impose any limitations on carbon dioxide
emissions.

Clean Water Act. Our existing facilities are also subject to a variety of state
and federal regulations governing existing and potential water/wastewater
discharges. Generally, such regulations are promulgated under authority of the
Clean Water Act and govern overall water/wastewater discharges through National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, permits. Under current
provisions of the Clean Water Act, existing NPDES permits must be renewed every
five years, at which time permit limits are extensively reviewed and can be
modified to account for changes in regulations or program initiatives. In
addition, the permits have re-opener clauses which allow the permitting
authority (which may be the United States or an authorized state) to attempt to
modify a permit to conform to changes in applicable laws and regulations. Some
of our existing facilities have been operating under NPDES permits for many
years and have gone through one or more NPDES permit renewal cycles. All of our
facilities required to have NPDES permits have those in place and are in
compliance with discharge limitations.

Solid Waste Disposal. We dispose of all solid wastes collected as a result of
burning coal at our power plants in approved solid waste disposal sites. Each
disposal site has been permitted by the state of its location in compliance with
law. Ash and wastes from flue gas and sulfur removal from the Wyodak and Neil
Simpson II plants are deposited in mined areas. These disposal areas are located
below some shallow water aquifers in the mine. None of the solid wastes from the
burning of coal is classified as hazardous material, but the wastes do contain
minute traces of metals that would be perceived as polluting if such metals were
leached into underground water. Recent investigations have concluded that the
wastes are relatively insoluble and will not measurably affect the post-mining
ground water quality. While management does not believe that any substances from
our solid waste disposal activities will pollute underground water, they can
give no assurances that pollution will not occur over time. In this event, we
could experience material costs to mitigate any resulting damages. Agreements in
place require PacifiCorp to be responsible for any such costs that would be
related to the solid waste from its 80 percent interest in the Wyodak plant.

Additional unexpected material costs could also result in the future if the
federal or state government determines that solid waste from the burning of coal
contains some hazardous material that requires special treatment, including
solid waste of which we previously disposed. In that event, the government
regulator could consequently hold those entities that disposed of such waste
responsible for such treatment.

                                       24

Mine Reclamation. Under federal and state laws and regulations, we are required
to submit to the regulation by, and receive approval from, the Wyoming
Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) for a mining and reclamation plan
which provides for orderly mining, reclamation and restoration of all of our
Wyodak coal mine in conformity with state laws and regulations. We have an
approved mining permit and are otherwise in compliance with other land quality
permitting programs.

Based on extensive reclamation studies, we currently estimate the cost of
reclamation for our mine at approximately $26 million and have currently accrued
approximately $18.2 million on our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet for
these reclamation costs. No assurance can be given that additional requirements
in the future will not be imposed that would cause an unexpected material
increase in reclamation costs.

One situation that could result in substantial unexpected increases in costs
relating to our reclamation permit concerns three depressions -- the "South"
depression, the "Peerless" depression and the "North Pit" depression - that have
or will result from our mining activities at the Wyodak mine. Because of the
thick coal seam and relatively shallow overburden, the current restoration plan
would leave these depressions, which have limited reclamation potential, with
interior drainage only. Although the DEQ has accepted the current plan to limit
reclamation of these depressions, it has reserved the right to review and
evaluate future reclamation plans or to reevaluate the existing reclamation
plan. If as a result of our mining activities, additional overburden becomes
available, the DEQ may require us to conduct additional reclamation of the
depressions, particularly if the DEQ finds that the current limited reclamation
is resulting in exceedances in the DEQ's water quality standards.

Ben French Oil Spill. In 1990 and 1991, we discovered extensive underground fuel
oil contamination at the Ben French plant site. With the help of expert
consultants, we worked closely with the South Dakota Department of Environment
and Natural Resources to assess and remediate the site. Our assessment and
remediation efforts continue today and we continue to monitor the site. All of
our underground oil-carrying facilities from which the contamination occurred
are now above ground. There have been no significant recoveries of free fuel oil
product since 1994. Soil borings and monitoring wells on the perimeters of our
Ben French plant property provide no indication of contamination beyond the
property's limits. Management believes that the underground spill has been
sufficiently remedied so as to prevent any oil from migrating off site. However,
due to underground gypsum deposits in this area, the fuel oil has the potential
of migrating to area waterways. In such event, cleanup costs could be greatly
increased. Management believes that sufficient remediation efforts to prevent
such a migration are currently in place, but due to the uncertainties of
underground geology, no assurance can be given.

Cleanup costs recognized to date total approximately $0.5 million, of which
amount $0.4 million has been reimbursed by the South Dakota Petroleum Release
Compensation Fund. To date, no penalties, claims or actions have been taken or
threatened against us because of this oil spill. In late 2001, the South Dakota
Department of Environment and Natural Resources started preparing a review,
which is directed at permanently closing numerous monitoring wells which have
shown no contamination for several years.

PCBs. Under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act, the EPA has issued
regulations that control the use and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls, or
PCBs. PCBs were widely used as insulating fluids in many electric utility
transformers and capacitors manufactured before the Toxic Substances Control Act
prohibited any further manufacture of PCB equipment. We remove and dispose of
PCB-contaminated equipment in compliance with law as it is discovered.

Release of PCB-contaminated fluids, especially any involving a fire or a release
into a waterway, could result in substantial cleanup costs. Several years ago,
we began a testing program of potential PCB-contaminated transformers, and in
1997 completed testing of all transformers and capacitors which are not located
in our electric substations. We have not completed the testing of sealed
potential transformers and bushings located in our electric substations as the
testing of this equipment requires their destruction. Release of
PCB-contaminated fluid, if present, from our equipment is unlikely and the
volume of fluid in such equipment is generally less than one gallon. Moreover,
any release of this fluid would be confined to our substation site.

Exploration and Production

Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to various
types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. They include:

     o    requiring permits for the drilling of wells;

     o    maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells;

     o    submitting and implementing spill prevention plans;

     o    submitting  notification relating to the presence,  use and release of
          certain contaminants incidental to oil and gas operations;

     o    regulating  the  location of wells,  the method of drilling and casing
          wells,  the use,  transportation,  storage and  disposal of fluids and
          materials used in connection with drilling and production  activities;
          and

     o    regulating  surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which
          wells have been drilled,  the plugging and abandoning of wells and the
          transporting of production.

Our operations are also subject to various conservation matters, including the
regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the
number of wells which may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of
oil and gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or
integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on
voluntary pooling of lands and leases, which may make it more difficult to
develop oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish
maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally prohibit the
venting or flaring of gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable
purchase of production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts
of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or
the locations at which we can drill. In addition, various federal, state and
local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of contaminants into the
environment, the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of
contaminants and the protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife
and environment affect our exploration, development and production operations
and our related costs.

Other Properties

In addition to the other properties described herein, we own an eight-story
office building consisting of approximately 47,000 square feet of office space
in Rapid City, South Dakota. We occupy approximately 75 percent of this building
and lease the remainder to others.

Employees

At December 31, 2001, we had 785 employees, approximately 287 of who are
employed in our utility business, 236 of who are employed in our integrated
energy businesses, 209 of who are employed in our communications business and 53
of who are employed by the parent company.

Approximately one-half of our utility employees are covered by collective
bargaining agreements with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers,
which expire on April 1, 2003. We have experienced no significant labor
stoppages or labor disputes at our facilities.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We are a growth oriented, diversified energy holding company operating
principally in the United States. Our unregulated and regulated businesses have
expanded significantly in recent years. Our integrated energy group, Black Hills
Energy, Inc. (formerly Black Hills Energy Ventures, Inc.), produces and markets
electric power and fuel. We produce and sell electricity in a number of markets,
with a strong emphasis in the western United States. We also produce coal,
natural gas and crude oil, primarily in the Rocky Mountain region, and market
fuel products nationwide. Our electric utility, Black Hills Power, Inc., serves
approximately 59,200 customers in South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana. Our
communications group offers state-of-the-art broadband communications services
to residential and business customers in Rapid City and the northern Black Hills
region of South Dakota through Black Hills FiberCom, LLC.

                                Business Strategy

We are executing a long-term growth strategy by adding and augmenting revenue
streams from our diverse integrated energy operations. We have implemented a
balanced, integrated and risk-managed approach to fuel production, energy
marketing and power generation. Built on the strength of our electric utility,
we have enhanced our local operations by providing broadband communications. Our
diverse operations help to avoid reliance on any single element to achieve our
growth objective. This diversity provides a measure of stability in volatile or
cyclical periods. We believe the strength of our low-cost assets and the
expertise of our management team together forge sustained opportunity for growth
and success.

Prospective Information

We reaffirm our goal of long-term annual earnings per share growth of 10 percent
to 15 percent off a "normalized" 2000 earnings per share base of $2.00, which
adjusts for the impact of high energy prices at that time. However, due to the
current low price environment in energy markets, near-term results may be lower
than our long-term objective.

Net income from the integrated energy group exceeded net income derived from our
electric utility in 2001. We expect that earnings growth from the integrated
energy group over the next few years will be driven primarily by our continued
expansion in the power generation and oil and gas production segments. The
following key elements are an integral part of our plan to achieve this
objective:

o    grow our  power  generation  segment  by  developing  and  acquiring  power
     projects in targeted western markets, and, in particular,  by expanding the
     generation  capacity  of our  existing  sites  through a strategy  known as
     "brownfield development;"

o    sell a  large  percentage  of our  production  from  new  projects  through
     long-term  contracts in order to secure  revenue  stability  at  attractive
     returns;

o    increase  our  reserves  of  natural  gas and crude oil and expand our fuel
     production;

o    manage the risks inherent in fuel marketing by maintaining  position limits
     that minimize price risk exposure;

o    conduct business with a diversified  group of counterparties of high credit
     quality;

o    exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing  expertise
     to remain a low-cost power producer;

o    increase  margins  from our coal  production  through an  expansion of mine
     mouth generation and increased coal sales;

o    build and maintain strong  relationships  with wholesale energy  customers;
     and

o    capitalize on our utility's established market presence,  relationships and
     customer loyalty to expand our integrated energy businesses.

Although we believe our integrated energy group will continue to grow as our
largest business group, we are unable to predict the price environment and
growth in the energy markets.

Our electric utility has continued to produce modest growth in revenue and
earnings from the retail business over the past two years. We believe that this
trend is stable and that, absent unplanned system outages, it will continue for
the

                                       30
<PAGE>


next several years due to the extension of our electric utility's rate
freeze until January 1, 2005. (See Rate Regulation.) We forecast firm energy
sales in our retail service territory to increase over the next 10 years at an
annual compound growth rate of approximately one percent, with the system demand
forecasted to increase at a rate of two percent. These forecasts are derived
from studies conducted by us whereby we examined and analyzed our service
territory to estimate changes in the needs for electrical energy and demand over
a 20-year period. These forecasts are only estimates, and the actual changes in
electric sales may be substantially different. Weather deviations can also
affect energy sales significantly when compared to forecasts based on normal
weather. The portion of the utility's future earnings that will result from
wholesale off-system sales will depend on many factors, including native load
growth, plant availability and electricity demand and commodity prices in the
western markets.

Although our broadband communications business significantly increased
residential and business customers in 2001, we expect it will sustain
approximately $6.5 million in net losses in 2002, with annual losses decreasing
thereafter and profitability expected by 2004. The recovery of capital
investment and future profitability are dependent primarily on our ability to
attract new customers, including customers from incumbent providers. Our goal is
to attain 60 percent penetration for both residential and commercial customers
within our service territory. If we are unable to attract additional customers
or technological advances make our network obsolete, we could have a material
write-down of assets. While we do not anticipate being regulated in the local
markets, we are unable to predict future markets, future government impositions
and future economic and competitive conditions that could affect the
profitability of the communications operations.

2001 Compared to 2000

Consolidated net income for 2001 was $87.6 million, compared to $52.8 million in
2000, or $3.42 per average common share in 2001, compared to $2.37 per average
common share in 2000. This equates to a 17.2 percent and 19.0 percent return on
year-end common equity in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The return on year-end
common equity in 2001 was diluted due to the net proceeds of $163 million from
the public stock offering in 2001.

We reported record earnings in 2001, primarily due to strong natural gas
marketing activity, increased fuel production, expanded power generation and
increased wholesale off-system electric utility sales. Strong results in our
integrated energy business group and electric utility business group were
partially offset by losses in our communications business. Unusual energy market
conditions stemming primarily from gas and electricity shortages in the West
contributed to our strong financial performance in 2001 and 2000. There was
approximately a $1.40 and a $0.40

                                       31
<PAGE>



contribution to 2001 and 2000 earnings per share, respectively, due to
prevailing prices of gas and electricity and unusually wide gas trading margins
in the last part of year 2000 and first half of 2001.

Consolidated revenues were slightly lower in 2001 at $1.56 billion compared to
$1.62 billion in 2000. Revenue increases in fuel production, independent power
generation, the electric utility and communications were offset by a decrease in
fuel marketing revenue. The effects of decreases in energy prices beginning in
late spring 2001 were partially offset by higher sales volumes. Daily volumes of
natural gas marketed increased 22 percent from 860,800 million British thermal
units per day in 2000 to 1,047,700 million British thermal units in 2001. Prices
of financial and physical natural gas marketed decreased from an average of
$2.77 per million British thermal units in 2000 to $2.14 per million British
thermal units in 2001.

Earnings in 2001 included a $4.4 million after-tax charge ($0.17 per share) for
a financial exposure to Enron Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries now in
bankruptcy. The exposure is primarily related to the value of a long-term swap
to provide natural gas to a power plant. We have taken action to mitigate this
exposure. By negotiations or by appropriate legal action filed in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, we will seek authority to
"net," or offset, certain obligations with Enron and its subsidiaries, both
payable and receivable, among our subsidiaries. If we are successful in these
efforts, substantially all of the financial value of the fuel swap could be
recovered, and we would not have any remaining exposure to Enron and its
bankrupt subsidiaries.

Earnings in 2001 also reflect a $0.12 per share charge for employee stock bonus
awards and the funding of a new non-profit foundation to advance our charitable
and philanthropic endeavors. Both of these transactions were funded with Black
Hills Corporation common stock.

2000 Compared to 1999

Consolidated net income for 2000 was $52.8 million, compared to $37.1 million in
1999, or $2.37 per average common share in 2000, compared to $1.73 per average
common share in 1999. This equates to a 19.0 percent and 17.1 percent return on
year-end common equity in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Earnings growth in 2000 was primarily due to strong natural gas marketing
activity, increased fuel production, expanded power generation and increased
wholesale off-system electric utility sales. Strong results in our integrated
energy business group were partially offset by losses in our communications
business. Unusual energy market conditions stemming primarily from gas and
electricity shortages in the West during the last part of 2000 contributed to
our strong financial performance. There was approximately a $0.40 contribution
to 2000 earnings per share due to higher prevailing prices of gas and
electricity and unusually wide gas trading margins.

Consolidated revenues more than doubled in 2000 to $1.6 billion compared to
1999. The growth in revenues in 2000 was a result of high energy commodity
prices and increased volumes of fuel marketed, primarily as a result of extreme
price volatility in the western markets, acquisitions and growth in the
integrated energy business group and increases in off-system sales by our
electric utility. Prices of financial and physical natural gas marketed
increased from an average of $1.38 per million British thermal units in 1999 to
$2.77 per million British thermal units in 2000.

The following business group and segment information does not include
intercompany eliminations.

EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization. EBITDA is used by management and some investors as an indicator of
a company's historical ability to service debt. Management believes that an
increase in EBITDA is an indicator of improved ability to service existing debt,
to sustain potential future increases in debt and to satisfy capital
requirements. However, EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows for the
period, nor has it been presented as an alternative to either operating income,
or as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating,
investing and financing activities, as determined by generally accepted
accounting principles. EBITDA as presented may not necessarily be comparable to
other similarly titled measures of other companies.

The following is a summary of sales volumes of our coal, oil and natural gas
production and various measures of power generation:

2001 Compared to 2000

Net income of our integrated energy group nearly doubled in 2001 compared to
2000. These strong earnings resulted primarily from the unusually high prices of
natural gas and high gas trading margins received in western markets during the
first half of 2001, an increase in volumes marketed and fuel production, and
expanded power generation.

                                       33
<PAGE>



In addition, in 2001, we reached a settlement of ongoing litigation with
PacifiCorp concerning rights and obligations under a coal supply agreement under
which PacifiCorp purchased coal from our coal mine to meet the coal requirements
of the Wyodak Power Plant. As a result of this settlement, we recognized $5.6
million pre-tax non-operating income. In addition, we sold the "North Conveyor
System" which resulted in a $2.6 million pre-tax gain. See Note 10 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The integrated energy business group's revenues decreased 8 percent in 2001
compared to 2000. A full year of independent power operations revenues related
to the July 2000 acquisition of Indeck Capital and an increase in fuel
production revenue was offset by decreased gas marketing revenue. Although daily
volumes of natural gas marketed increased 22 percent, gas marketing revenues
declined due to a decrease in prices of financial and physical natural gas
marketed from an average of $2.77 per million British thermal units in 2000 to
$2.14 per million British thermal units in 2001.

The integrated energy business group's total operating expenses decreased 11
percent due to a decrease in the cost of sales related to lower commodity
prices. EBITDA and operating income increased over 117 percent and 68 percent,
respectively from 2000 levels due to the decline in operating expenses and
higher production volumes.

2000 Compared to 1999

Net income of our integrated energy group increased 144 percent in 2000 compared
to 1999. Operating expenses, operating income and EDITDA increased over 117
percent, 345 percent and 166 percent, respectively. These increases resulted
primarily from our gas marketing operations--which experienced a dramatic
increase in both trading volumes and margins, a significant increase in fuel
production volumes, record fuel and power prices and expanded power generation,
including the acquisition of Indeck Capital.

The integrated energy business group's revenues increased 121 percent in 2000
compared to 1999. The revenue increase was a direct result of gas and
electricity shortages in the West Coast markets and the closing of the Indeck
Capital acquisition. Daily volumes of natural gas marketed increased 35 percent.

Fuel Marketing

Our fuel marketing companies produced the following results:

                                2001           2000            1999

  Net income (loss)              35,058         14,009           (185)
  EBITDA                         55,414         23,977          2,995

Our fuel marketing companies generate large amounts of revenue and corresponding
expense related to buying and selling energy commodities. Fuel marketing is
extremely competitive, and margins are typically very small.

2001 Compared to 2000

Earnings from the fuel marketing segment increased $21.1 million due
substantially to high gas margins received in the first half of 2001, as well as
a 22 percent increase in natural gas average daily volumes marketed in 2001
compared to 2000. Revenues decreased 13 percent from 2000 as a decline in
margins in the last half of 2001 more than offset higher daily volumes.

The unusual energy market conditions stemming primarily from natural gas and
electricity shortages in California and our ability to capture the higher
margins contributed significantly to the strong financial performance.

<PAGE>


2000 Compared to 1999

The strong increase in earnings in 2000 compared to 1999 was due to the unusual
energy market conditions that existed in the last half of 2000 stemming from the
natural gas and electricity shortages in California. Average daily volumes of
natural gas marketed increased 35 percent in 2000 compared to 1999.

Power Generation

Our power generation segment produced the following results:

                              2001             2000           1999

  Net income (loss)            1,576           3,241          (109)
  EBITDA                      44,363          17,630          (157)

2001 Compared to 2000

2001 reflects the first full year of operations of our power generation segment
and our continued expansion of generation facilities. We now own 617 net
megawatts in currently operating plants. Of these 617 net megawatts,
approximately 90 percent are under contracts or tolling arrangements with at
least one year remaining. An additional 364 megawatts of generating capacity is
currently under construction. Substantially all of this output will be sold
pursuant to existing long-term contracts. The increased production capacity was
offset by a $4.4 million after-tax charge for Enron exposure, reserves for
exposure to western power markets and reduced water flow at hydro power plants
in New York.

2000 Compared to 1999

Results from the power generation segment were not significant in 1999. In July
2000, we completed the acquisition of Indeck Capital, representing a significant
advancement of our position in the power generation segment. At December 31,
2000 we owned 250 net megawatts of generation in operating plants and had 470
megawatts of generating capacity under construction.

Oil and Gas

Oil and gas operating results were as follows:

The following is a summary of our oil and gas reserves at December 31:

                                     2001           2000            1999

These reserves are based on reports prepared by Ralph E. Davis Associates, Inc.,
an independent consulting and engineering firm. Reserves were determined using
constant product prices at the end of the respective years. Estimates of
economically recoverable reserves and future net revenues are based on a number
of variables, which may differ from actual results. We intend to increase our
net proved reserves by selectively increasing our oil and gas exploration and
development activities and by acquiring producing properties.

2001 Compared to 2000

Record net income in 2001 was primarily a result of a 27 percent increase in the
average price received and a 38 percent increase in production volumes. The
increase in gas reserves at December 31, 2001 was due to strong drilling results
and reserve acquisitions.

In 2001, we acquired the operating and non-operating interests in 74 gas and oil
wells located in Colorado and Wyoming from Stewart Petroleum Corporation of
Denver, Colorado, for approximately $10 million. The acquired interest in these
fuel assets represents approximately 10 billion cubic feet equivalent of natural
gas. The acquisition increased our proved reserves by approximately 22 percent
(based on year-end 2000 reserve estimates) and our current production rates by
10 percent.

2000 Compared to 1999

The increase in net income in 2000 was primarily the result of record natural
gas prices, higher crude oil prices, and a significant increase in production
volumes. The increase in economically recoverable oil reserves at December 31,
2000 was due to improved product prices.

Coal Mining

Coal mining results were as follows:

                              2001            2000            1999

EBITDA                        18,468         11,361           14,965

2001 Compared to 2000

Coal mining earnings increased $4.4 million as a result of a coal contract
settlement, a gain on the sale of mining equipment and a 15 percent increase in
tons sold, partially offset by lower average coal prices due to a coal contract
settlement and an increase in mining related expenses. Tons of coal sold
increased primarily due to the commencement of sales through our train load-out
facility.

In 2001, we reached a settlement of ongoing litigation with PacifiCorp
concerning rights and obligations under a coal supply agreement under which
PacifiCorp purchased coal from our coal mine to meet the coal requirements of
the Wyodak Power Plant. As a result of this settlement, we recognized $5.6
million pre-tax non-operating income. In addition, we sold the "North Conveyor
System" which resulted in a $2.6 million pre-tax gain. See Note 10 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

2000 Compared to 1999

A planned five-week outage at the Wyodak Plant resulted in lower coal sales and

We currently have a winter peak of 344 megawatts established in December 1998
and a summer peak of 392 megawatts established in August 2001. We own 395
megawatts of electric utility generating capacity and purchase an additional 65
megawatts under a long-term agreement (decreasing to 60 megawatts in 2002). An
additional 40 megawatts of generating capacity is currently under construction.

2001 Compared to 2000

Electric revenue increased 23 percent in 2001 compared to 2000. The increase in
electric revenue in 2001 was primarily due to a 78 percent increase in wholesale
off-system sales at an average price that was 27 percent higher than the average
price in 2000. The increase in off-system sales was driven by high spot market
prices for energy in early 2001, which enabled us to generate more energy from
our combustion turbine facilities, including the Neil Simpson combustion
turbine, which we placed into commercial operation in June 2000. Megawatt-hours
generated from our oil-fired diesel and natural gas-fired combustion turbines
were 440,368 in 2001, compared to 305,767 in 2000. Historically, market prices
were not sufficient to support the economics of generating from these
facilities, except to meet peak demand and as standby use for native load
requirements.

Firm kilowatt-hour sales increased 2 percent in 2001. Residential and commercial
sales increases of 3 percent in 2001 were partially offset by a slight decrease
in industrial sales, primarily due to load reductions at Homestake Gold Mine.
Degree days, a measure of weather trends, were 3 percent below normal in 2001
and 4 percent below 2000.

Revenue per kilowatt-hour sold was 7.0 cents in 2001 compared to 6.4 cents in
2000. The number of customers in the service area increased to 59,237 from
58,601 in 2000. The increase in the revenue per kilowatt-hour sold in 2001 is
due to a 41 percent increase in wholesale off-system sales to 965,030
megawatt-hours and strong average wholesale power prices.

Electric utility operating expenses increased 22 percent in 2001 primarily due
to a 29 percent increase in purchased power costs and a 14 percent increase in
the average cost of generation. The increase in the average cost of generation
was primarily associated with the operation of certain gas-fired combustion
turbines.

In addition, 2001 results include a $2.0 million after-tax non-cash charge
related to the contribution of Black Hills Corporation Common Stock to the newly
formed Black Hills Corporation Foundation. This Foundation was created to
enhance our longstanding practice of giving back to our communities. Through the
Foundation, we may strengthen our service to our valued customers and fellow
citizens for generations to come.

2000 Compared to 1999

Electric revenue increased 30 percent in 2000 compared to 1999. The increase in
electric revenue in 2000 was primarily due to a 381 percent increase in
wholesale off-system sales at an average price that was 3 times higher than the
average price in 1999. The increase in off-system sales was driven by high spot
market prices for energy in late 2000, which enabled us to generate more energy
from our combustion turbine facilities, including the Neil Simpson combustion
turbine, which we placed into commercial operation in June 2000. Megawatt-hours
generated from our oil-fired diesel and natural gas-fired combustion turbines
were 305,767 in 2000 compared to 25,882 in 1999.

Firm kilowatt-hour sales increased 3 percent. Residential and commercial sales
increases of 4 percent were partially offset by a 2 percent decrease in
industrial sales, primarily due to load reductions at Homestake Gold Mine.
Degree days, a measure of weather trends, were 16 percent above 1999 and 1
percent above normal.

Revenue per kilowatt-hour sold was 6.4 cents in 2000 compared to 5.4 cents in
1999. The number of customers in the service area increased to 58,601 in 2000
from 57,709 in 1999. The increase in the revenue per kilowatt-hour sold in 2000
is due to a 54 percent increase in wholesale off-system sales to 684,378
megawatt-hours and robust wholesale power prices.

Electric utility operating expenses increased by 30 percent in 2000 primarily
due to increased fuel, purchased power, and operating and maintenance expenses,
partially offset by lower depreciation. Fuel expense in 2000 included the cost
associated with the additional combustion turbine generation.

In September 1998, we formed our broadband communications business to provide
facilities-based communications services for Rapid City and the northern Black
Hills of South Dakota. We have invested approximately $125 million in
state-of-the-art technology that offers local and long distance telephone
service, expanded cable television service, Internet access, and high-speed data
and video services. We began serving communications customers in late 1999 and
market our services to schools, hospitals, cities, economic development groups,
and business and residential customers. The build-out is approximately 85
percent complete at December 31, 2001. Losses are expected to continue as we
proceed with building the network and increasing the customer base. We expect
our communications group will sustain approximately $6.5 million in net losses
in 2002, with annual losses decreasing thereafter and profitability expected by
2004. The recovery of capital investment and future profitability are dependent
primarily on our ability to attract new customers. If we are unable to attract
additional customers or technological advances make our network obsolete, we
could have a material write-down of assets.

2001 Compared to 2000

Our customer base nearly doubled in 2001 to 15,660 residential customers and
2,250 business customers. The increase in revenues from a larger customer base
in 2001 was partially offset by increases in reserves for inventory and carrier
billings and increased interest expense. Operating expense increased due to the
expansion of the business. Operating performance in 2001 was in line with our
expectations.

                                       38
<PAGE>


2000 Compared to 1999

Operating losses in 2000 were attributable to increased interest, depreciation
and operating expenses. Operating losses in 1999 were primarily due to start-up
organizational costs, increased depreciation expense and increased interest
expense associated with the capital deployment.

                          Critical Accounting Policies

We prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. We are required to make
certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable
based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods
presented. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most
critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include
the following:

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

We periodically review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including
goodwill and other intangibles, for continued appropriateness. This review is
based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows. If the anticipated
future cash flows are less than our carrying value, then a permanent non-cash
write-down is required to be charged to earnings. Although we believe our
estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding
such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations.

Full Cost Method of Accounting for Oil and Gas Activities

We account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method whereby all
productive and nonproductive costs related to acquisition, exploration and
development drilling activities are capitalized. These costs are amortized using
a unit-of-production method based on volumes produced and proved reserves. Any
conveyances of properties, including gains or losses on abandonments of
properties, are treated as adjustments to the cost of the properties with no
gain or loss recognized. Net capitalized costs are subject to a "ceilings test"
that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net
revenues of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved
properties. This method values the reserves based upon actual oil and gas prices
at the end of each reporting period adjusted for contracted price changes. If
the net capitalized costs exceed the full-cost ceiling, then a permanent
non-cash write-down is required to be charged to earnings in that reporting
period. Although our net capitalized costs were less than the full cost ceiling
at December 31, 2001, we can make no assurances that a write-down in the future
will not occur depending on oil and gas prices at that point in time. In
addition, we rely on an independent consulting and engineering firm to determine
the amount of our proved reserves based on a number of assumptions about
variables. We can make no assurances that these assumptions will not differ from
actual results.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

Derivative instruments used in our trading activities are recorded at fair
value, and realized and unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component
of income. Fair values are based on listed market prices, where possible. If
listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other
relevant factors. Fair values for certain derivative contracts are derived from
pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the
underlying financial instruments or commodities, as well as time value and yield
curve or volatility factors underlying the positions.

Pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of
unrealized gains and losses recognized, and the use of different pricing models
or assumptions could produce different financial results. Changes in the
commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future. To the
extent financial contracts have extended maturity dates, our estimates of fair
value may involve greater subjectivity due to the lack of transparent market
data available upon which to base modeling assumptions.

                                       39
<PAGE>

Counterparty Credit Risk

We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits
based upon payment history and the customer's current creditworthiness, as
determined by our review of their current credit information. We continuously
monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for
estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific
customer collection issue that we have identified. While most credit losses have
historically been within our expectations and provisions established, we cannot
guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we
have in the past or that an investment grade counterparty will not default as
was the case with Enron in 2001. We accrued for a $4.4 million after-tax loss in
2001 in regards to the Enron bankruptcy, which was outside our original
provision. In addition, in 2001 we accrued approximately $1.0 million after-tax
loss for payments owed by Southern California Edison, however this payment was
collected in the first quarter of 2002.

Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

The determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other
postretirement benefits is dependent on the use of certain assumptions by
actuaries in calculating the amounts. Those assumptions are described in Note 11
of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and include, among others, the
discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on assets and the rate of
increase in compensation levels and healthcare benefits. In accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from our
assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore,
generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future
periods. Although we believe our assumptions are appropriate, significant
differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions
may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our
future expense.

                         Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow Activities

2001

In 2001, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating
needs, to pay dividends on common and preferred stock, to pay long-term debt
maturities and to fund a material amount of our property additions. We continue
to fund property and investment additions primarily related to construction of
additional electric generation facilities for our integrated energy business
group through a combination of operating cash flow, increased short-term debt
and long-term non-recourse project financing. Cash flows from operations
increased $107 million, primarily due to increased net income, depreciation,
deferred taxes and decreased working capital.

In the second quarter of 2001, we issued 3.4 million shares of common stock
through an underwritten public offering at $52 per share. Total net proceeds of
approximately $163 million were used to repay a portion of current indebtedness
under revolving credit facilities, to fund various power plant construction
projects and for general corporate purposes.

Also, in the second quarter of 2001 we acquired the Fountain Valley facility, a
240 megawatt generation facility located near Colorado Springs, Colorado,
featuring six LM-6000 simple-cycle, gas-fired turbines from Enron Corporation.
The facility became operational in the third quarter of 2001. Total project cost
was approximately $183 million that we financed primarily with non-recourse
debt. We have an 11-year contract with Public Service Company of Colorado to
utilize the facility for peaking purposes under a tolling arrangement in which
we assume no fuel risk.

In the third quarter of 2001, we purchased a 277 megawatt gas-fired
co-generation power plant project located in North Las Vegas, Nevada from Enron
North America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corporation. The facility
currently has a 53 megawatt co-generation power plant in operation of which we
own 50 percent. Although we only

                                       40
<PAGE>


own 50 percent of this power plant, under generally accepted accounting
principles we are required to consolidate 100 percent of this plant. Most of the
power from the 53 megawatt facility is sold under a long-term contract expiring
in 2024. In addition, the project also has a 224 megawatt combined-cycle
expansion under construction, of which we own 100 percent. The facility is
scheduled to be fully operational in third quarter 2002 and will utilize LM-6000
technology. The power to be generated by the expansion project is also under a
long-term sales contract that expires in 2017. Total cost of the project is
estimated to be approximately $330 million of which $240 million was expended
and financed with short-term borrowings at December 31, 2001. We plan on
financing the transaction primarily with non-recourse project level debt in
2002.

In addition, during the third quarter of 2001, we completed a $400 million
revolving credit facility, which replaced our previous short-term credit lines,
which totaled $290 million.

2000

In 2000, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating
needs, to pay common and preferred dividends and to pay long-term debt
maturities. We funded property additions primarily related to construction of
additional electric generation facilities for our integrated energy business
group through a combination of operating cash flow, increased short-term debt
and long-term non-recourse project financing. Investing and financing activities
increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of Indeck Capital in July
2000 and construction of several generating facilities. Cash flows from
operations decreased $2.9 million, primarily due to increased working capital
partially offset by increased net income and depreciation. We expect increased
operating cash flows resulting from our investing activities to support the
additional indebtedness.

As part of our acquisition of Indeck Capital, we incurred $40.3 million of
additional debt through an increase in borrowings on our short-term credit
facilities, which were used to repay certain obligations of Indeck Capital. In
addition, we issued 1.537 million shares of common stock and 4,000 shares of
convertible preferred stock to the former Indeck Capital shareholders.

Dividends

Dividends paid on our common stock totaled $1.12 per share in 2001. This
reflected increases approved by our board of directors from $1.08 per share in
2000 and $1.04 per share in 1999. All dividends were paid out of current
earnings. Our three-year annual dividend growth was 3.8 percent. In January
2002, our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend 3.6 percent to 29
cents per share. If this dividend is maintained during 2002, it will be
equivalent to $1.16 per share, an annual increase of 4 cents per share. The
determination of the amount of future cash dividends, if any, to be declared and
paid will depend upon, among other things, our financial condition, funds from
operations, the level of our capital expenditures, restrictions under our credit
facilities and our future business prospects.

Short-Term Liquidity and Financing Transactions

Our principal sources of short-term liquidity are our revolving bank facilities
and cash provided by operations. As of December 31, 2001 we had available a $200
million 364-day facility and a $200 million three-year facility both dated
August 28, 2001. In addition, on January 4, 2002, we entered into a $50.0
million bridge credit agreement that expires June 30, 2002. These bank
facilities can be used to fund our working capital needs, for general corporate
purposes and to provide liquidity for a commercial paper program if implemented.
At December 31, 2001, we had $360 million of bank borrowings outstanding under
these facilities. The corresponding amount outstanding at February 28, 2002 was
$384 million. After inclusion of applicable letters of credit, the remaining
borrowing capacity under the bank facilities was $7.0 million and $32.0 million
at December 31, 2001 and February 28, 2002, respectively.

The above bank facilities include covenants that are common in such
arrangements. Such covenants include a consolidated net worth in an amount of
not less than the sum of $375 million and 50 percent of the aggregate
consolidated net income beginning June 30, 2001; a recourse leverage ratio not
to exceed 0.65 to 1.00; an interest

                                       41
<PAGE>

coverage ratio of not less than 3.00 to 1.00; and a credit rating of at least
"BBB-" from Standard & Poor's or "Baa3" from Moody's Investor Service. If these
covenants are violated, it would be considered an event of default and the
lender has the right to terminate the remaining commitment and accelerate the
principal and interest outstanding to become immediately due. In addition,
certain of our interest rate swap agreements with a $150 million notional amount
at December 31, 2001 include cross-default provisions. These provisions would
allow the counterparty the right to terminate the swap agreement and liquidate
at a prevailing market rate, in the event of default.

In addition, Enserco Energy, Inc., our gas marketing unit, has a $75.0 million
uncommitted, discretionary line of credit to provide support for the purchase of
natural gas. The line of credit is secured by all of Enserco's assets. We
provide no other guarantees to the lender under this facility. At December 31,
2001 and 2000, there were outstanding letters of credit issued under the
facility of $36.2 million and $69.8 million, respectively, with no borrowing
balances on the facility.

Similarly, Black Hills Energy Resources, Inc., our oil marketing unit, has a
$25.0 million uncommitted, discretionary credit facility secured by all of its
assets. We provide no other guarantees to the lender under this facility. This
line of credit provides credit support for the purchases of crude oil by Black
Hills Energy Resources. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, Black Hills Energy
Resources had letters of credit outstanding of $4.4 million and $8.5 million,
respectively, and no balance outstanding on its overdraft line.

Based upon our expected cash flows from operations, expected project financings
for the year, credit facility capacity, and projected cash needs in the near
term, we do not expect any liquidity issues in the foreseeable future.

On March 15, 2002, we closed on $135 million of senior secured financing for our
Arapahoe and Valmont Facilities, 210 megawatts of gas-fired generation located
in the Denver, Colorado area. Proceeds from this financing were used to
refinance $53.8 million of an existing seven-year senior secured term facility,
pay down approximately $50.0 million of short-term credit facility borrowings
and approximately $31.0 million will be used for future project construction
costs.

In addition, we plan on seeking long-term project-level non-recourse financing
for the Las Vegas Project, a 277 megawatt gas-fired generation complex located
in North Las Vegas, Nevada during 2002. Total project costs are estimated to be
$330 million of which approximately $240 million was expended as of December 31,
2001 and was funded with short-term credit facility borrowings.

Our consolidated net worth was $515 million at December 31, 2001. The long-term
debt component of our capital structure at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was 45
percent and 52 percent, respectively. Our total debt leverage (long-term debt
and short-term debt) was 61 percent and 65 percent at December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

(a)  Approximately  74 percent of the  floating  rate term loans has been hedged
     with an interest rate swap moving the floating rates to fixed rates.  See -
     "Financing Activities under Market Risk Disclosures."

(b)  Unconditional  purchase  obligations  include the capacity costs associated
     with a purchase power  agreement with PacifiCorp and certain coal purchase,
     gas purchase,  and gas transportation  agreements.  The energy charge under
     the purchase power agreement and the commodity price under the gas purchase
     contract are variable  costs which for  purposes of  estimating  our future
     obligations, were calculated using existing prices at December 31, 2001.

(c)  Black Hills Generation,  a subsidiary in our power generation segment,  has
     entered into  agreements with Wygen Funding,  Limited  Partnership to lease
     the Wygen Plant, a 90 megawatt coal-fired power plant under construction in
     Campbell  County,  Wyoming.  Wygen Funding is a special purpose entity that
     owns the Wygen  Plant  and has  financed  the  project.  Total  cost of the
     project is estimated to be $130 - $140 million.  Neither Wygen Funding, its
     owners,  nor its  officers  are  related  to us,  and other  than the lease
     transaction and  obligations  incurred as a result of the  transaction,  we
     have no obligation  to provide  additional  funding or issue  securities to
     Wygen Funding. Lease payments are based on final construction and financing
     costs and are currently estimated to be approximately $6.5 million per year
     based  on  five-year  treasury  rates.  Lease  payments  will  begin  after
     substantial  completion  of  construction  scheduled  to occur in the first
     quarter of 2003. The lease will be accounted for as an operating lease. The
     initial  lease term is five years with two  five-year  renewal  options and
     includes a purchase  option equal to the  adjusted  acquisition  cost.  The
     adjusted  acquisition cost is essentially equal to the cost of the project.
     If Black Hills  Generation  elects to terminate and not renew the lease and
     not purchase the project,  then it must make a termination payment equal to
     the  lesser  of  83.5  percent  of the  adjusted  acquisition  cost  or the
     shortfall  proceeds  received  from the sale of the  project.  Black  Hills
     Corporation has guaranteed the agreements.

(a)  Under our coal mining permit,  we are required to reclaim all land where we
     have mined coal reserves. The cost of reclaiming the land is accrued as the
     coal is mined.  While the  reclamation  process  takes place on a continual
     basis, much of the reclamation occurs over an extended period after we mine
     the  area.   Approximately   $0.7  million  is  charged  to  operations  as
     reclamation expense annually.  As of December 31, 2001, accrued reclamation
     costs were approximately $18.2 million.

Credit Ratings

As of February 28, 2002, our corporate credit rating is "A3" by Moody's
Investors Service and "BBB" by Standard & Poor's. In addition, our utility's
first mortgage bonds are rated "A1" and "BBB+" by Moody's and Standard & Poor's,
respectively. These security ratings are subject to revision and/or withdrawal
at any time by the respective rating organizations.

Capital Requirements

Our primary capital requirements for the three years ended December 31, 2001
were as follows:

Our capital additions for 2001 were $594 million. The major capital items for
the year included the following:

o    Acquisition of the 240 megawatt Fountain Valley gas-fired turbine
     generation facility located near Colorado Springs, Colorado which was
     placed in service in third quarter 2001.
o    Acquisition of the 277 megawatt gas-fired co-generation power plant project
     located near Las Vegas, Nevada of which 53 megawatts were operational and
     224 megawatts is expected to be placed in service in the third quarter of
     2002.

     site in Denver, Colorado, which is expected to be placed in service in
     mid-2002.
o    Completion of construction of the 40 megawatt gas-turbine expansion at our
     Valmont, Colorado site, which we placed in service in July 2001.
o    Completion of construction of the 40 megawatt gas-fired combustion turbine
     unit at our Wyodak site, which we placed in service in May 2001.
o    Completion of the 18 megawatt combined-cycle upgrade of the Harbor facility
     near Long Beach, California.
o    Acquisitions of various interests in partnerships in which we previously
     held a minority interest.
o    Acquisition of operating and non-operating interests in 74 gas and oil
     wells from Stewart Petroleum Corporation.
o    Construction of a 40 megawatt gas-fired turbine known as the Lange project,
     which is expected to be placed in service in early 2002.
o    Construction of our communications fiber optic network.

Forecasted capital requirements for projected plant construction, other
integrated energy investments, regulated utility capital improvements and
completion of the communications network are as follows:

                                =========       ========        ========

Our integrated energy business group's forecasted capital requirements include
the following:

o    Completion of construction of the 224 megawatt gas-fired co-generation
     power plant project located near Las Vegas, Nevada which is expected to be
     placed in service in the third quarter of 2002.
o    Completion of construction of a 50 megawatt combined-cycle expansion at our
     Arapahoe, Colorado site (expected in mid-2002).
o    Deployment of $500 million for generating projects and acquisitions of
     proven producing natural gas properties and low-risk exploration and
     development drilling in years 2003-2004.

We expect to finance our integrated energy business group's purchase and
construction of electric generating facilities, primarily with long-term,
non-recourse project level debt. We expect that any project-level debt will
contain significant restrictions on distributions of cash from the project to
us.

In addition to the above forecasted capital items we will lease the Wygen Plant,
a 90 megawatt coal-fired plant under construction at our Wyodak, Wyoming site
through an off-balance sheet financing arrangement discussed above under
Short-term Liquidity and Financing Transactions. Because of the leasing
arrangement, the $130 - $140 million total construction cost of the plant is not
included in the above three-year capital expenditure forecast. Wygen will be
similar in design to our Neil Simpson II facility, which was completed in 1995
at the same site. The plant will run on low-sulfur coal fed by conveyor from our
adjacent Wyodak coal mine and will use the latest available environmental
control technology. We anticipate that the Wygen Plant will be operational in
the first quarter of 2003.

Forecasted capital expenditures for our electric utility operations include
completion of construction of a 40 megawatt gas-fired turbine known as the Lange
project expected to be in service in mid-2002, construction of an AC/DC/AC Tie
which is expected to be placed in service in 2003, transmission and substation
projects, re-build projects on existing transmission lines, distribution
projects in response to customer requests for electric service, capital projects
associated with our utility's existing generation plants, and other
miscellaneous items.

Our communications group's capital requirements forecast primarily consists of
2002 costs related to the completion of our fiber optic network in Rapid City
and the northern Black Hills of South Dakota, nominal extensions of the base
network to reach additional customers, and capital improvements to the existing
network infrastructure.

                             Market Risk Disclosures

Our operations and financial results are impacted by numerous factors including,
but not limited to, commodity price risk, interest rate risk and counterparty
risk. We are exposed to commodity price variability in nearly all of our core
energy marketing and trading businesses. In addition, fuel requirements for our
gas-fired generation and our natural long position in crude oil and natural gas
production introduce additional commodity price risk.

Fuel Marketing Activities

We market natural gas, coal, and crude oil in specific areas of the United
States and Canada. We offer wholesale fuel marketing and price risk management
products and services to a variety of customers. These activities are subject to
numerous risks, including commodity price risk.

We have adopted Risk Management Policies and Procedures (RMP&P) covering all
marketing activities. These RMP&P's have been approved by our Board of Directors
and are routinely reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The
RMP&P include, but are not limited to, trader limits, position limits and credit
exposure limits.

We employ risk management methods to mitigate our commodity price risk. As a
general policy, we only permit speculation with limited "open" positions as
defined in the RMP&P. Therefore, substantially all of our marketing activities
are fully hedged or back-to-back positions; in other words, each sale is matched
with a purchase.

To maintain compliance with these RMP&P and mitigate our commodity price risk,
we routinely utilize fixed price forward purchase and sales contracts and
over-the-counter swaps and options. We attempt to balance our fixed price
physical and financial purchase and sale commitments in terms of volume and
timing of performance and delivery obligations. However, we may at times have a
bias in the market, within established guidelines, resulting from the management
of our portfolio. In addition, we may, at times, be unable to fully hedge our
portfolio for certain market risks as a result of marketplace illiquidity and
other factors.

Our fuel marketing operations fall under the purview of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities" and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98-10,
"Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF 98-10). As
such, these activities are accounted for under mark-to-market accounting. The
fair values are recorded as either Derivative assets and/or Derivative
liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The net gains or
losses are recorded as Revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Income.

At December 31, 2001, we had a mark to fair value unrealized gain of $5.4
million for our fuel marketing activities. Of this amount, $5.2 million was
current and $0.2 million was non-current. The current portion of unrealized
gains included $5.5 million gain associated with hedged transactions and $(0.3)
million loss associated with open positions. We anticipate that substantially
all of the current portion of unrealized gains for hedged transactions will be
realized during the next twelve months. Conversely, estimated and actual
realized gains or losses related to open positions will likely change during
2002 as market prices change from the December 31, 2001 estimates.

Non-trading Energy Activities

We produce natural gas and crude oil through our exploration and production
activities. These natural "long" positions, or unhedged open positions,
introduce commodity price risk and variability in our cash flows. We employ risk
management methods to mitigate this commodity price risk and preserve our cash
flows. We have adopted guidelines covering hedging for our natural gas and crude
oil production. These guidelines have been approved by our Board of Directors
and are routinely reviewed by our Audit Committee.

To mitigate commodity price risk and preserve cash flows, we use
over-the-counter swaps and options. These derivative instruments fall under the
purview of SFAS 133 and we elect to utilize hedge accounting as allowed under
this Statement.

At December 31, 2001, we had a portfolio of swaps to hedge portions of our crude
oil and natural gas production. These transactions were previously identified as
cash flow hedges, properly documented and met prospective effectiveness testing.
At year-end, these transactions met retrospective effectiveness testing criteria
and retained their cash flow hedge status.

At December 31, 2001, the derivatives were marked to fair value and were
recorded as Derivative assets or Derivative liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivatives
was reported in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion was
reported in earnings.

On January 1, 2001 (the transition adjustment date for SFAS 133 adoption), and
on December 31, 2001, we had the following swaps and related balances (in
thousands):

  *Crude in bbls, gas in MMBtu's

Most of our crude oil and natural gas hedges are highly effective, resulting in
very little earnings impact prior to realization. During 2001, we recorded $0.1
million in earnings due to ineffectiveness for certain natural gas swaps due to
basis risk.

All existing hedges at December 31, 2001 expire during the year ended December
31, 2002. The unrealized earnings gains or losses currently recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be realized in earnings
during 2002. Based on December 31, 2001 market prices, $2.0 million will be
realized and reported in earnings during 2002. These estimated realized gains
for 2002 were calculated using December 31, 2001 market prices. Estimated and
actual realized gains will likely change during 2002 as market prices change.

In addition, we acquired several natural gas swaps when we completed the Las
Vegas Cogeneration acquisition on August 31, 2001 (See Note 15). The project has
a long-term fixed price power sales agreement and an index-priced natural gas
purchase contract for 5,000 MMBtus per day through April 30, 2010. These swaps
fix the long-term purchase price of the index-priced natural gas purchase
contract. At acquisition close, the fair value of these swaps

                                       48
<PAGE>

was $6.0 million. These swaps were executed with Enron North America Corp.
(Enron), which is currently in bankruptcy proceedings.

These swaps are derivatives under SFAS 133. We elected to treat these
derivatives as cash flow hedges so that any gains or losses on the fair values
of the swaps could be deferred and subsequently recognized when the underlying
hedged natural gas was consumed in the plant. The swaps were properly documented
and met the criteria for cash flow hedges.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, we determined that it was probable that Enron
would default on its obligations to us in conjunction with these swaps. Upon
that determination, we ceased to account for these swaps as cash flow hedges. In
addition, we recognized a $6.0 million pre-tax valuation reserve in recognition
of Enron's probable performance default and resulting consequence that we would
not receive payment for these amounts. We have taken action to mitigate this
exposure. By negotiations or by appropriate legal action filed in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, we will seek authority to "net"
or offset, certain obligations with Enron and its subsidiaries, both payable and
receivable, among our subsidiaries. If we are successful in these efforts,
substantially all of the financial value of the fuel swap could be recovered,
and we would not have any remaining exposure to Enron or its bankrupt
subsidiaries.

Financing Activities

We engage in activities to manage risks associated with changes in interest
rates. We have entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements to
reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with our floating
rate debt obligations. At December 31, 2001, these hedges met effectiveness
testing criteria and retained their cash flow hedge status. At December 31,
2001, we had $291.4 million of notional amount floating-to-fixed interest rate
swaps, having a maximum term of five years and a fair value of $(14.4) million.
These hedges are substantially effective and any ineffectiveness was immaterial.

In addition to the above interest rate swaps, we have entered into a $100
million forward starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swap to hedge the
anticipated floating rate debt financing related to the Las Vegas Cogeneration
expansion. The forward starting period for the swap is the second quarter of
2002, with a term of ten years. The swap will terminate and cash settle on its
forward starting date, based on the fair market value of the swap at the
starting date. At December 31, 2001, the swap had a fair market value of $2.3
million. The hedge has met effectiveness criteria. Upon completion of the
long-term financing of the project, any gain or loss on the fair market value of
the swap is anticipated to be amortized over the life of the long-term
financing.

On January 1, 2001 (the transition adjustment date for SFAS 133 adoption) and on
December 31, 2001, our interest rate swaps and related balances were as follows

We anticipate a portion of unrealized losses recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income will be realized as increased interest expense in 2002.
Based on December 31, 2001 market interest rates, $11.7 million will be realized
as additional interest expense during 2002. Estimated and realized amounts will
likely change during 2002 as market interest rates change.

At December 31, 2001, we had $655.8 million of outstanding, floating-rate debt
of which $264.4 million was not offset with interest rate swap transactions that
effectively convert the debt to a fixed rate. A 100 basis point increase in
interest rates would cause interest expense to increase $2.6 million.

Credit Risk

Credit risk relates to the risk of financial loss resulting from non-performance
of contractual obligations by a counterparty. We maintain credit policies with
regards to our counterparties that we believe limit our overall credit risk.

For our fuel marketing, energy production and risk management activities, we
attempt to mitigate our credit risk by conducting a majority of our business
with investment grade companies, obtaining netting agreements where possible and
securing our exposure with less creditworthy counterparties through parental
guarantees, prepayments and letters of credit.

We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits
based upon payment history and the customer's current creditworthiness, as
determined by our review of their current credit information. We maintain a
provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and
any specific customer collection issue that we have identified. While most
credit losses have historically been within our expectations and provisions
established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same
credit loss rates that we have in the past or that an investment grade
counterparty will not default as was the case with Enron in 2001.

At the end of the year, our credit exposure (exclusive of regulated utility
retail customers and communications) was concentrated with investment grade
companies. Approximately 85 percent of our credit exposure was with investment
grade companies. For the 15 percent credit exposure with non-investment grade
rated counterparties, approximately 60 percent of this exposure was supported
through letters of credit, prepayments, parental guarantees and asset liens.

                                 Rate Regulation

Existing Rate Regulation

In June 1999, the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission approved a
settlement, which extended a rate freeze in effect since 1995 until January 1,
2005.

The South Dakota settlement provides that, absent an extraordinary event, we may
not file for any increase in our rates or invoke any fuel and purchased power
adjustment tariff which would take effect during the freeze period. The
specified extraordinary events are:

o    new governmental impositions increasing annual costs for South Dakota
     customers by more than $2.0 million;
o    simultaneous forced outages of both our Wyodak plant and Neil Simpson II
     plant projected to continue at least 60 days;
o    forced outages occurring to either plant which continue for a period of
     three months and are projected to last at least nine months;
o    an increase in the Consumer Price Index at a monthly rate for six months
     which would result in a 10 percent or higher annual inflation rate;
o    the loss of a South Dakota customer or revenue from an existing South
     Dakota customer that would result in a loss of revenue of $2.0 million or
     more during any 12-month period;
o    the cost of coal to our South Dakota customers increases and is projected
     to increase by more than $2.0 million over the cost for the most recent
     calendar year; and
o    electric deregulation occurs as a result of either federal or state
     mandate, which allows any of our customers to choose its provider of
     electricity at any time during the freeze period.

During the freeze period, except as identified above, we are undertaking the
risks of:

o    machinery failure;
o    load loss caused by either an economic downturn or changes in regulation;
o    increased costs under power purchase contracts over which we have no
     control;
o    government interferences; and
o    acts of nature and other unexpected events that could cause material
     losses of income or increases in costs of doing business.

However, the settlement anticipates that we will retain, during that period of
time, earnings realized from more efficient operations, sales from load growth,
and off-system sales of power and energy.

Over the last four years we have initiated an effort to enter into new contracts
with our largest industrial customers. The new contracts contain "meet or
release" provisions that grant us a five-year right to continue to serve a
customer at market rates in the event of deregulation. Additionally, through our
General Service Large Optional Combined Account Billing Tariff, we have allowed
general service customers to aggregate their loads. This tariff also provides us
with a five-year right to continue to serve those customers in the event of
deregulation. Our "meet or release" contracts currently total more than 124
megawatts of large commercial and industrial load. These contracts provide us
the assurance of a firm local market for our power resources, in the event
deregulation occurs. These industrial and large commercial customers, together
with our wholesale power sale agreements with the City of Gillette, Wyoming and
Montana-Dakota Utilities Company, equal approximately 50 percent of our
utility's firm load.

Regulatory Accounting

As it pertains to the accounting for our utility operations, we follow SFAS No.
71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and our
financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles
followed by the various jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result of our
regulatory activity, a 50-year depreciable life for the Neil Simpson II plant is
used for financial reporting purposes. If we were not following SFAS 71, a 35-
to 40-year life would probably be more appropriate which would increase
depreciation expense by approximately $0.6 million per year. If rate recovery of
generation-related costs becomes unlikely or uncertain, due to competition or
regulatory action, these accounting standards may no longer apply to our
generation operations. In the event we determine that we no longer meet the
criteria for following SFAS 71, the accounting impact to us could be an
extraordinary non-cash charge to operations of an amount that could be material.
Criteria that may give rise to the discontinuance of SFAS 71 include increasing
competition that could restrict our ability to establish prices to recover
specific costs and a significant change in the manner in which rates are set by
regulators from cost-based regulation to another form of regulation. We
periodically review these criteria to ensure that the continuing application of
SFAS 71 is appropriate.

                          New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141)
and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142). SFAS 141
requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed
annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment.
Intangible assets with a defined life will continue to be amortized over their
useful lives (but with no maximum life). The amortization provisions of SFAS 142
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001. With
respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, we
were required to adopt SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002. We are currently
evaluating the effects adoption has on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS 143). SFAS 143 requires
that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be
recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset
retirement costs being capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each
period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the
related asset. We expect to adopt SFAS 143 effective January 1, 2003 and are
currently evaluating the effects adoption will have on our consolidated
financial statements.

In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (SFAS
144). SFAS 144 supersedes FASB Statement 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" (SFAS 121) and
the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal
of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently
Occurring Events and Transactions" (APB 30). SFAS 144 establishes a single
accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale as well as
resolves implementation issues related to SFAS 121. We were required to adopt
SFAS 144 effective January 1, 2002. Adoption did not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

                   Safe Harbor for Forward Looking Information

In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act), we are hereby filing cautionary
statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to
differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements (as such
term is defined in the Reform Act) made by or on behalf of the Company in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K, Annual Report, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and
presentations, or in response to questions or otherwise. These statements
concern our plans, expectations and objectives for future operations. All
statements, other than statements of historical fact that address activities,
events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will or may occur
in the future are forward-looking statements. The words "anticipate," "believe,"
"estimate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "predicts," "project," "will likely
result," "will continue," or similar expressions are not statements of
historical fact and may be forward-looking. These forward-looking statements
include, among others, such things as:

o        expansion and growth of our business and operations;
o        future financial performance;
o        future acquisition and development of power plants;
o        future production of coal, oil and natural gas;
o        reserve estimates; and
o        business strategy.

Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that we believe are
reasonable based on current expectations and projections about future events and
industry conditions and trends affecting our business. However, whether actual
results and developments will conform to our expectations and predictions is
subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results
to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements,
including the following factors:

o        prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions, with respect
         to allowed rates of return, industry and rate structure, acquisition
         and disposal of assets and facilities, operation and construction of
         plant facilities, recovery of purchased power and other capital
         investments, and present or prospective wholesale and resale
         competition;
o        changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and
         policies;
o        weather conditions;
o        population growth and demographic patterns;
o        competition for retail and wholesale customers;
o        pricing and transportation of commodities;
o        market demand, including structural market changes;
o        changes in tax rates or policies or in rates of inflation;
o        changes in project costs;
o        unanticipated changes in operating expenses or capital expenditures;
o        capital market conditions;
o        creditworthiness of counterparties;
o        technological advances;
o        competition for new energy development opportunities; and
o        legal and administrative proceedings that influence our business and
         profitability.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as to the date on which that statement
is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement
to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which that statement is
made or to reflect the occurrence of an anticipated event. New factors emerge
from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such
factors, nor can it assess the impact of any such factor on the business or the
extent to which factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ
materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders of Black Hills Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Black Hills
Corporation (a South Dakota corporation) and Subsidiaries as of December 31,
2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, common
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Black Hills Corporation and
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

As explained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities."

power activities, all aggregated for reporting purposes as Black Hills Energy
(formerly Black Hills Energy Ventures); operates its public utility electric
operations through its subsidiary, Black Hills Power, Inc.; and operates its
communications operations through its indirect subsidiaries Black Hills Fiber
Systems, Black Hills FiberCom L.L.C. and Daksoft. For further descriptions of
the Company's business segments, see Note 14.

In December 2000, the Company effected a holding company structure under the
renamed holding company, Black Hills Corporation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. The most significant estimates relate to allowance for
uncollectable accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence, realization of market
value of derivatives due to commodity risk, intangible asset valuations and
useful lives, proved oil and gas reserve volumes, employee benefit plans,
environmental accruals and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Black Hills
Corporation and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and certain
subsidiaries in which the Company's ownership interest may be less than 50
percent but represents voting control. Generally, the Company uses equity
accounting for investments of which it owns between 20 and 50 percent and
investments in partnerships under 20 percent if the Company exercises
significant influence.

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation except for revenues and expenses associated with intercompany coal
sales in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation"
(SFAS 71). Total intercompany coal sales not eliminated were $11.2 million, $9.7
million and $7.7 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

The Company owns 51 percent of the voting securities of Black Hills FiberCom,
LLC (FiberCom). During 2000, FiberCom's operating losses reduced its members'
equity below zero. At that point, the Company began to recognize 100 percent of
FiberCom's operating losses and will continue to do so until such time as
additional equity investments are made by third parties or future net income
restores members' equity to a positive amount.

As discussed in Note 15, the Company and its subsidiaries made several
acquisitions during 2001 and 2000. The Company's consolidated statements of
income include operating activity of these companies beginning with their
acquisition date.

The Company uses the proportionate consolidation method to account for its
working interests in oil and gas properties.

Minority Interest in Subsidiaries

Minority interest in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income
represents the share of income or loss of certain consolidated subsidiaries
attributable to the minority shareholders of those subsidiaries. The minority
interest in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect the amount of
the underlying net assets of those certain consolidated subsidiaries
attributable to the minority shareholders in those subsidiaries.

Regulatory Accounting

The Company's subsidiary, Black Hills Power, is subject to regulation by various
state and federal agencies. The accounting policies followed are generally
subject to the Uniform System of Accounts of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC). These accounting policies differ in some respects from those
used by the Company's non-regulated businesses.

Black Hills Power follows the provisions of SFAS 71, and its financial
statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed
by the various jurisdictions regulating Black Hills Power. As a result of Black
Hills Power's 1995 rate case settlement, a 50-year depreciable life for the Neil
Simpson II plant is used for financial reporting purposes. If Black Hills Power
were not following SFAS 71, a 35 to 40 year life would be more appropriate,
which would increase depreciation expense by approximately $0.6 million per
year. If rate recovery of generation-related costs becomes unlikely or
uncertain, due to competition or regulatory action, these accounting standards
may no longer apply to Black Hills Power's generation operations. In the event
Black Hills Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for following
SFAS 71, the accounting impact to the Company could be an extraordinary non-cash
charge to operations of an amount that could be material. Criteria that give
rise to the discontinuance of SFAS 71 include increasing competition that could
restrict Black Hills Power's ability to establish prices to recover specific
costs and a significant change in the manner in which rates are set by
regulators from cost-based regulation to another form of regulation. The Company
periodically reviews these criteria to ensure that the continuing application of
SFAS 71 is appropriate.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Securities Available-for-Sale

The Company has investments in marketable securities that are classified as
available-for-sale securities and are carried at fair value in accordance with
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." The
unrealized gain or loss resulting from the difference between the securities'
fair value and cost basis is included as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income in common stockholders' equity.

Inventory

Materials, supplies and fuel are generally stated at the lower of cost or market
on a first-in, first-out basis. During 2001, 2000 and 1999, provisions of $1.4
million, $1.5 million and $0, respectively, were charged to operations to
write-down inventories at the Company's communications group to estimated net
realizable value. Natural gas, oil and coal inventories held in fuel marketing
companies are stated at market.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Additions to property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost when placed in
service. Included in the cost of regulated construction projects is an allowance
for funds used during construction (AFUDC) which represents the approximate
composite cost of borrowed funds and a return on capital used to finance the
project. The AFUDC was computed at an annual composite rate of 10.2, 9.7 and 8.3
percent during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In addition, the Company
capitalizes interest, when applicable, on certain non-regulated construction
projects. The amount of AFUDC and interest capitalized was $7.5 million, $2.0
million and $1.2 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The cost of
regulated electric property, plant and equipment retired, or otherwise disposed
of in the ordinary course of business, together with removal cost less salvage,
is charged to accumulated depreciation. Retirement or disposal of all other
assets, except for oil and gas properties as described

                                       60
<PAGE>

below, result in gains or losses recognized as a component of income. Repairs
and maintenance of property are charged to operations as incurred.

Depreciation provisions for regulated electric property, plant and equipment is
computed on a straight-line basis using an annual composite rate of 3.0 percent
in 2001, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3.1 percent in 1999. Non-regulated property,
plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using estimated
useful lives ranging from 3 to 39 years. Capitalized coal mining costs and coal
leases are amortized on a unit-of-production method on volumes produced and
estimated reserves.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the
net assets of acquired businesses and through 2001 was amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets, which ranged
from 8 to 25 years. The cost of other acquired intangibles is amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense was
$4.4 million, $3.1 million and $2.7 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Accumulated amortization was $11.1 million, $6.7 million and $3.6
million at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets

The Company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have
occurred which may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the
remaining balance of its long-lived assets. If such events or circumstances were
to indicate that the carrying amount of these assets was not recoverable, the
Company would estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of
the assets and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future
cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) was less than the
carrying amount of the long-lived assets, the Company would recognize an
impairment loss. No impairment loss was recorded during 2001, 2000 or 1999.

Oil and Gas Operations

The Company accounts for its oil and gas activities under the full cost method.
Under the full cost method, all productive and nonproductive costs related to
acquisition, exploration and development drilling activities are capitalized.
These costs are amortized using a unit-of-production method based on volumes
produced and proved reserves. Any conveyances of properties, including gains or
losses on abandonments of properties, are treated as adjustments to the cost of
the properties with no gain or loss recognized.

Under the full cost method, net capitalized costs are subject to a "ceiling
test" which limits these costs to the present value of future net cash flows
discounted at 10 percent, net of related tax effects, plus the lower of cost or
fair value of unproved properties included in the net capitalized costs. Future
net cash flows are estimated based on end-of-period spot market prices adjusted
for contracted price changes. If the net capitalized costs exceed the full cost
"ceiling" at period end, a permanent noncash write-down would be charged to
earnings in that period unless subsequent market price changes eliminate or
reduce the indicated write-down. Given the volatility of oil and gas prices, it
is possible that the Company's estimate of discounted future net cash flows from
proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term. If oil and gas prices
decline significantly, even if only for a short period of time, it is possible
that a write-down of oil and gas properties could occur in the future. No
"ceiling test" write-downs were recorded during 2001, 2000 or 1999.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Under the
liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized, at currently enacted
income tax rates, to reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the
financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Such temporary differences
are the result of provisions in the income tax law that either require or permit
certain items to be reported on the income tax return in a different period than
they are reported in the financial statements. The Company classifies deferred
tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts based on the
classification of the related assets and liabilities.

                                       61

Revenue Recognition

Generally, revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an
arrangement with a fixed or determinable price, delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Fuel
marketing businesses also use the mark-to-market method of accounting. Under
that method, all energy trading activities are recorded at fair value as of the
balance sheet date and net gains or losses resulting from the revaluation of
these contracts to fair value are recognized currently in the results of
operations. For long-term non-utility power sales agreements revenue is
recognized either in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 91-6,
"Revenue Recognition of Long-Term Power Sales Contracts," or in accordance with
SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," as appropriate. Under EITF 91-6, revenue
is generally recognized as the lower of the amount billed or at the average rate
expected over the life of the agreement. Under SFAS 13, revenue is generally
levelized over the life of the agreement. For its Investments in Associated
Companies (see Note 3), which are involved in power generation, the Company uses
the equity method to recognize as earnings its pro rata share of the net income
or loss of the associated company.

Earnings Per Share of Common Stock

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
each year. Diluted earnings per share is computed under the treasury stock
method and is calculated to compute the dilutive effect primarily resulting from
outstanding stock options and conversion of preferred shares.

Reclassifications

Certain 2000 and 1999 amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 2001 presentation. These reclassifications had no
effect on the Company's common stockholders' equity or results of operations, as
previously reported.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141)
and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142). SFAS 141
requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed
annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment.
Intangible assets with a defined life will continue to be amortized over their
useful lives (but with no maximum life). The amortization provisions of SFAS 142
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001. With
respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, the
Company was required to adopt SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002. Management is
currently evaluating the effects adoption has on the Company's consolidated
financial statements.

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS 143). SFAS 143 requires
that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be
recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset
retirement costs being capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each
period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the
related asset. Management expects to adopt SFAS 143 effective January 1, 2003
and is currently evaluating the effects adoption will have on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (SFAS
144). SFAS 144 supersedes FASB Statement 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" (SFAS 121) and
the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal
of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently
Occurring Events and Transactions" (APB 30). SFAS 144 establishes a single
accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale as well as
resolves implementation issues related to SFAS 121. The Company was required to
adopt SFAS 144 effective January 1, 2002. Adoption did not have a material
impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

Change in Accounting Principle - Derivatives and Hedging Activities

In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
133 (SFAS 133), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."
SFAS 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring
that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an
asset or liability measured at its fair value. SFAS 133 requires that changes in
the derivative instrument's fair value be recognized currently in earnings
unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

SFAS 133 allows hedge accounting for fair value and cash flow hedges. SFAS 133
provides that the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and
qualifying as a fair value hedging instrument as well as the offsetting loss or
gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk be recognized currently
in earnings in the same accounting period. SFAS 133 provides that the effective
portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying
as a cash flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other
comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or
periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The
remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, must be recognized
currently in earnings.

SFAS 133 requires that on date of initial adoption, an entity shall recognize
all freestanding derivative instruments in the balance sheet as either assets or
liabilities and measure them at fair value. The difference between a
derivative's previous carrying amount and its fair value shall be reported as a
transition adjustment. The transition adjustment resulting from adopting this
Statement shall be reported in net income or other comprehensive income, as
appropriate, as the effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance
with paragraph 20 of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20 (APB 20),
"Accounting Changes."

On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 133. Upon adoption, most of the
Company's fuel marketing activities previously accounted for under Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue No. 98-10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk
Management Activities" (EITF 98-10) fell under the purview of SFAS 133. The
effect of adoption on the fuel marketing companies and risk management
activities was not material because, unless otherwise noted, the fuel marketing
companies did not designate their risk management activities as hedge
instruments. This "no hedge" designation resulted in these derivatives being
measured at fair value and gains and losses recognized currently in earnings.
This treatment under SFAS 133 was comparable to the accounting under EITF 98-10.

At January 1, 2001, the Company had certain non-trading energy contracts and
interest rate swaps documented as cash flow hedges. These contracts were defined
as derivatives under SFAS 133 and met the requirements for cash flow hedges.
Because these contracts were documented as hedges prior to adoption, the
transition adjustment was reported in accumulated other comprehensive income.
The aggregated entry for these derivatives identified as cash flow hedges
increased derivative assets by $0.9 million, increased the derivative
liabilities by $11.2 million and decreased accumulated other comprehensive
income by $10.3 million pre-tax.

(2)      RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

The Company's operations and financial results are impacted by numerous factors
including, but not limited to, commodity price risk, interest rate risk and
counterparty risk. The Company is exposed to commodity price variability in
nearly all core energy marketing and trading businesses. In addition, fuel
requirements at its gas-fired generation and its natural long position in crude
oil and natural gas production introduce additional commodity price risk.

Fuel Marketing Activities

The Company markets natural gas, coal, and crude oil in specific areas of the
United States and Canada. The Company offers wholesale fuel marketing and price
risk management products and services to a variety of customers. These
activities subject the Company to numerous risks including commodity price risk.

The Company has adopted Risk Management Policies and Procedures (RMP&P) covering
all marketing activities. The RMP&P have been approved by the Company's Board of
Directors and are routinely reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors. The RMP&P include, but are not limited to, trader limits, position
limits and credit exposure limits.

                                       63
<PAGE>


The Company employs risk management methods to mitigate its commodity price
risk. As a general policy, the Company only permits speculation with limited
"open" positions as defined in the RMP&P. Therefore, substantially all of its
marketing activities are fully hedged or back-to-back positions; in other words,
each sale is matched with a purchase.

To maintain compliance with the RMP&P and mitigate its commodity price risk, the
Company routinely utilizes fixed price forward purchase and sales contracts and
over-the-counter swaps and options. The Company attempts to balance its fixed
price physical and financial purchase and sale commitments in terms of volume
and timing of performance and delivery obligations. However, the Company may at
times have a bias in the market, within established guidelines, resulting from
the management of its portfolio. In addition, the Company may, at times, be
unable to fully hedge its portfolio for certain market risks as a result of
marketplace illiquidity and other factors.

The Company's fuel marketing operations fall under the purview of SFAS 133 and
EITF 98-10. As such, these activities are accounted for under mark-to-market
accounting. The Company records its fair values as either Derivative assets
and/or Derivative liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The net gains or losses are recorded as Revenues in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Income.

The contract or notional amounts and terms of the Company's derivative commodity
instruments held for trading purposes at December 31, 2001 and 2000, are set
forth below:

At December 31, 2001, the Company had a mark to fair value unrealized gain of
$5.4 million for its fuel marketing activities. Of this amount, $5.2 million was
current and $0.2 million was non-current. The current portion of unrealized
gains included $5.5 million gain associated with hedged transactions and $(0.3)
million loss associated with open positions. The Company anticipates that
substantially all of the current portion of unrealized gains for hedged
transactions will be realized during the next twelve months. Conversely,
estimated and actual realized gains or losses related to open positions will
likely change during 2002 as market prices change from the December 31, 2001
estimates.

Non-trading Energy Activities

The Company produces natural gas and crude oil through its exploration and
production activities. These natural long positions, or unhedged open positions,
introduce commodity price risk and variability in cash flows for the Company.
The Company employs risk management methods to mitigate this commodity price
risk and preserve its cash flows. The Company has adopted guidelines covering
hedging for its natural gas and crude oil production. These guidelines have been
approved by the Company's Board of Directors and are routinely reviewed by its
Audit Committee.

To mitigate commodity price risk and preserve cash flows, the Company uses
over-the-counter swaps and options. These derivative instruments fall under the
purview of SFAS 133 and the Company elects to utilize hedge accounting as
allowed under this Statement.

At December 31, 2001, the Company had a portfolio of swaps to hedge portions of
its crude oil and natural gas production. These transactions were previously
identified as cash flow hedges, properly documented, and met prospective
effectiveness testing. At year-end, these transactions met retrospective
effectiveness testing criteria and retained their cash flow hedge status.

At December 31, 2001, the derivatives were marked to fair value and were
recorded in Derivative assets or Derivative liabilities on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The effective portion of the gain or loss on these
derivatives was reported in other comprehensive income and the ineffective
portion was reported in earnings.

-----------------------
*crude in bbls, gas in MMBtu's

Most of the Company's crude oil and natural gas hedges are highly effective,
resulting in very little earnings impact prior to realization. During 2001, the
Company recorded $0.1 million earnings due to ineffectiveness for certain
natural gas swaps due to basis risk.

All existing hedges at December 31, 2001 expire during the year ended December
31, 2002. The unrealized earnings gains or losses currently recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be realized in earnings
during 2002. Based on December 31, 2001 market prices, $2.0 million will be
realized and reported in earnings during 2002. These estimated realized gains
for 2002 were calculated using December 31, 2001 market prices. Estimated and
actual realized gains will likely change during 2002 as market prices change.

In addition, the Company acquired several natural gas swaps when it completed
the Las Vegas Cogeneration acquisition on August 31, 2001 (Note 15). The project
has a long-term fixed price power sales agreement and an index-priced natural
gas purchase contract for 5,000 MMBtus per day through April 30, 2010. These
swaps fix the long-term purchase price of the index-priced natural gas purchase
contract. At acquisition close, the fair value of these swaps was $6.0 million.
These swaps were executed with Enron North America Corp. (Enron), which is
currently in bankruptcy proceedings.

These swaps are derivatives under SFAS 133. The Company elected to treat these
derivatives as cash flow hedges so that any gains or losses on the fair values
of the swaps could be deferred and subsequently recognized when the underlying
hedged natural gas was consumed in the plant. The swaps were properly documented
and met the criteria for cash flow hedges.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company determined that it was probable
that Enron would default on its obligations to the Company in conjunction with
these swaps. Upon that determination, the Company ceased to account for these
swaps as cash flow hedges. In addition, the Company recognized a $6.0 million
pre-tax valuation reserve in recognition of Enron's probable performance default
and resulting consequence that the Company would not receive payment for these
amounts.

Financing Activities

The Company engages in activities to manage risks associated with changes in
interest rates. The Company has entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate
swap agreements to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated
with its floating rate debt obligations. At December 31, 2001, these hedges met
effectiveness testing criteria and retained their cash flow hedge status. At
December 31, 2001, the Company had $291.4 million of notional amount
floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, having a maximum term of five years and a
fair value of $(14.4) million. These hedges are substantially effective and any
ineffectiveness was immaterial.

In addition to the above interest rate swaps, the Company has entered into a
$100 million forward starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swap to hedge the
anticipated floating rate debt financing related to the Company's Las Vegas
Cogeneration

                                       66
<PAGE>

expansion. The forward starting period for the swap is the second
quarter of 2002, with a term of ten years. The swap will terminate and cash
settle on its forward starting date, based on the fair market value of the swap
at the starting date. At December 31, 2001, the swap had a fair market value of
$2.3 million. The hedge has met effectiveness criteria. Upon completion of the
long-term financing of the project, any gain or loss on the fair market value of
the swap is anticipated to be amortized over the life of the long-term
financing.

At December 31, 2001, the Company had $655.8 million of outstanding, floating
rate debt, of which $264.4 million was not offset with interest rate swaps
transactions that effectively convert the debt to fixed rate.

On January 1, 2001 (the transition adjustment date for SFAS 133 adoption) and on
December 31, 2001, the Company's interest rate swaps and related balances were

</TABLE>


The Company anticipates a portion of unrealized losses recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income will be realized as increased interest expense in
2002. Based on December 31, 2001 market interest rates, $11.7 million will be
realized as additional interest expense during 2002. Estimated and realized
amounts will likely change during 2002 as market interest rates change.

Credit Risk

Credit risk relates to the risk of financial loss resulting from non-performance
of contractual obligations by a counterparty. The Company maintains credit
policies with regards to its counterparties that the Company believes limit its
overall credit risk.

For its fuel marketing, energy production and risk management activities, the
Company attempts to mitigate its credit risk by conducting a majority of its
business with investment grade companies, obtaining netting agreements where
possible and securing its exposure with less creditworthy counterparties through
parental guarantees, prepayments and letters of credit.

At the end of the year, the Company's credit exposure (exclusive of regulated
retail customers and communications) was concentrated with investment grade
companies. Approximately 85 percent of the Company's credit exposure was with
investment grade companies. For the 15 percent credit exposure with
non-investment grade rated counterparties, approximately 60 percent of this
exposure was supported through letters of credit, prepayments, parental
guarantees and asset liens.

(4)      COMMON STOCK

Common Stock Offering

During 2001, the Company completed a public offering of its common stock through
which approximately 3.4 million shares were sold at $52 per share. Net proceeds
were approximately $163 million after commissions and expenses. The proceeds
were used to repay a portion of current indebtedness under revolving credit
facilities, to fund various power plant construction costs and for general
corporate purposes.

Employee Stock Incentive and Employee Stock Purchase Plans

The Company has several employee stock incentive plans (Stock Incentive Plans),
which allow for the granting of stock options with exercise prices equal to the
stock's fair market value on the date of grant, and an employee stock purchase
plan (ESPP Plan). The Company accounts for such plans under APB No. 25, and has
adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock
Based Compensation" (SFAS 123). Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
recognized.

                                       68

The Company maintains the ESPP Plan under which it sells shares to employees at
90 percent of the stock's market price on the offering date. The Company issued
48,368, 21,394 and 19,565 shares of common stock under the ESPP Plan in 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. At December 31, 2001, 177,808 shares are reserved
and available for issuance under the ESPP Plan. The fair value per share of
shares sold in 2001 was $22.50 on the offering date.

Employee Stock Awards

During 2001, the Company issued a total of 36,550 common shares as a stock bonus
award to its non-officer employees. The bonus was grossed up to cover related
employee taxes. The total pre-tax compensation charge recognized by the Company
was $1.9 million, which is based on the market value of the stock on the grant
date. Additionally, approximately 18,000 common shares will be issued at the
two-year anniversary date of the original award, contingent on certain vesting
restrictions. Pre-tax compensation cost related to this portion of the award is
estimated to be $0.9 million and is being expensed over the two-year vesting
period.

During 2001, the Company issued 12,177 restricted common shares (net of 4,512
common shares forfeited) to certain officers. The shares carry a restriction on
the officer's ability to sell the shares, until the shares vest. The shares vest
one-third per year over three years, contingent on employment. Pre-tax
compensation cost related to the award was $0.7 million, which is being expensed
over the three-year vesting period.

Nonemployee stock award

During 2001, the Company issued 100,000 common shares as a charitable
contribution to the newly formed not-for-profit entity, Black Hills Corporation
Foundation. The charitable contribution cost included in "Other, net" on the
2001 Consolidated Statement of Income was $3.1 million, which is based on the
stock market value on the grant date.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan under which
shareholders may purchase additional shares of common stock through dividend
reinvestment and/or optional cash payments at 100 percent of the recent average
market price. The Company has the option of issuing new shares or purchasing the
shares on the open market. The Company purchased shares on the open market in
2001, 2000 and 1999. At December 31, 2001, 1,290,797 shares of unissued common
stock were available for future offerings under the Plan.

(5)      PREFERRED STOCK

The Company has 25,000,000 authorized shares of no-par preferred stock.

During 2001 and 2000, the Company issued 5,177 preferred shares in the Indeck
Capital acquisition and the related "earn-out" provisions. The preferred shares
issued are non-voting, cumulative, no par shares with a dividend rate equal to 1
percent per annum per share, computed on the basis of $1,000 per share plus an
amount equal to any dividend declared payable with respect to the common stock,
multiplied by the number of shares of common stock into which each share of
preferred stock is convertible. The record and payment dates are the same as the
record and payment dates with respect to the payment of dividends on common
stock. No dividend may be declared or paid with respect to common stock unless
such a dividend is declared and paid with respect to the preferred stock. The
preferred stock is senior to the common stock in liquidation events.

The Company may redeem the preferred stock in whole or in part, at any time
solely at its option. The redemption price per share for the preferred stock
shall be $1,000 per share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. Each share of
the preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder into common stock
at any time prior to July 7, 2005 and automatically converted into common stock
on July 7, 2005. Each share of preferred stock is convertible into 28.57 common
shares. If the Company delivers a notice of redemption, the conversion price
shall be adjusted to equal the lesser of (i) the conversion price then in
effect, and (ii) the current market price on the redemption notice date.

(7)      NOTES PAYABLE

The Company has committed lines of credit with various banks totaling $400
million at December 31, 2001 and $290 million at December 31, 2000. At December
31, 2001, these lines consist of a $200 million revolving credit facility with a
term of 364 days, which terminates August 27, 2002, and a $200 million revolving
credit facility with a term of three years, which terminates on August 27, 2004.
The Company had $360 million of borrowings and $33.0 million of letters of
credit and $211 million of borrowings and $20.6 million of letters of credit
issued on the lines at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company had

The above facilities contain ratings trigger provisions that, if violated, would
be considered an event of default and would allow the lender to terminate the
remaining commitment and accelerate the principal and interest outstanding to
become immediately due. The Company would be considered in violation of these
ratings trigger provisions if its Standard & Poor's (S&P) Rating ceases to be at
least BBB- or its Moody's Rating ceases to be at least Baa3. In addition,
certain of the Company's interest rate swap agreements with a $150.0 million
notional amount and a $0.7 million fair value at December 31, 2001 include
cross-default provisions. These provisions would allow the counterparty the
right to terminate the swap agreement and liquidate at a prevailing market rate,
in the event of default. The Company's S&P and Moody's Ratings were BBB and A3,
respectively at December 31, 2001.

In addition to the above lines of credit, at December 31, 2001, Enserco Energy
(Enserco) has a $75.0 million ($90.0 million at December 31, 2000) uncommitted,
discretionary line of credit to provide support for the purchases of natural
gas. The line of credit is secured by all of Enserco's assets. The Company and
its other subsidiaries provide no guarantees to the lender. At December 31, 2001
and 2000, there were outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility of
$36.2 million and $69.8 million, respectively, with no borrowing balances on the
facility.

Black Hills Energy Resources (BHER) has a $25.0 million uncommitted,
discretionary credit facility secured by all of its assets. The transactional
line of credit provides credit support for the purchases of crude oil of BHER.
The Company and its other subsidiaries provide no guarantees to the lender. At
December 31, 2001 and 2000, BHER had letters of credit outstanding of $4.4
million and $8.5 million, respectively, with no borrowing balances on the
facility.

Our credit facilities contain certain restrictive covenants. The Company and its
subsidiaries had complied with all the covenants at December 31, 2001.

Interest rates under the facility borrowings vary and are based, at the option
of the Company at the time of the loan origination, on either (i) a prime based
borrowing rate varying from prime rate (4.75 percent at December 31, 2001) to
prime rate plus 1.0 percent, or (ii) on a London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
based borrowing rate varying from LIBOR plus 0.6 percent to LIBOR plus 0.625
percent. The one-month LIBOR rate at December 31, 2001 was 1.87 percent. In
addition to interest on outstanding borrowings, the credit facilities contain a
0 percent to 0.15 percent annual facility fee on the total facility amount, and
an annual utilization fee ranging from 0 percent to 0.125 percent of the total
used facility amount.

The Company has entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge a
portion of its exposure to interest rate fluctuations with the above floating
rate obligations. See Note 2 for further details.

</TABLE>

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of the Company's financial instruments.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these
instruments.


                                       72
<PAGE>



Securities Available-for-Sale

The fair value of the Company's investments equals the quoted market price when
available and a quoted market price for similar securities if a quoted market
price is not available. The Company has classified all of its marketable
securities as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2001 and 2000. An unrealized
gain on the Company's investments of $1.4 million and an unrealized loss of $0.8
million was recorded as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Derivative Financial Instruments

These instruments are carried at fair value. Descriptions of the various
instruments the Company uses and the valuation method employed are available in
Note 2 of these Consolidated Financial Statements.

Notes Payable

The carrying amount approximates fair value due to their variable interest rates
with short reset periods.

Long-Term Debt

The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated based on quoted
market rates for debt instruments having similar maturities and similar debt
ratings. The Company's outstanding bonds are either currently not callable or
are subject to make-whole provisions which would eliminate any economic benefits
for the Company to call and refinance the bonds.

(9)      JOINTLY OWNED FACILITY

The Company owns a 20 percent interest and Pacific Power owns an 80 percent
interest in the Wyodak Plant (Plant), a 330 megawatt coal-fired electric
generating station located in Campbell County, Wyoming. Pacific Power is the
operator of the Plant. The Company receives 20 percent of the Plant's capacity
and is committed to pay 20 percent of its additions, replacements and operating
and maintenance expenses. As of December 31, 2001, the Company's investment in
the Plant included $71.7 million in electric plant and $22.8 million in
accumulated depreciation, and is included in the corresponding captions in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's share of direct expenses
of the Plant was $5.9 million, $5.6 million and $4.9 million for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and is included in the
corresponding categories of operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Income. As discussed in Note 10, the Company's coal mining
subsidiary, Wyodak Resources, supplies coal to the Plant under an agreement
expiring in 2022. This coal supply agreement is collateralized by a mortgage on
and a security interest in some of Wyodak Resources' coal reserves. Under the
coal supply agreement, PacifiCorp is obligated to purchase a minimum of
1,500,000 tons of coal each year of the contract term, subject to adjustment for
planned outages. Wyodak Resources' sales to the Plant were $21.0 million, $23.2
million and $24.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

(10)     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Off Balance Sheet Lease

The Company's subsidiary, Black Hills Generation, has entered into an Agreement
for Lease and Lease with Wygen Funding, Limited Partnership for the Wygen Plant,
a 90 megawatt coal-fired power plant under construction in Campbell County,
Wyoming. Wygen Funding is a special purpose entity that owns the Wygen Plant and
has financed the project. Total cost of the project is estimated to be
approximately $130 - $140 million. Neither Wygen Funding, its owners, nor its
officers are related to the Company, and other than the lease transaction and
obligations incurred as a result of this transaction, there is no obligation to
provide additional funding or issue securities to Wygen Funding. Lease payments
are based on final construction and financing costs and are currently estimated
to be approximately $6.5 million per year based on five-year treasury rates.
Lease payments will begin after substantial completion of construction scheduled
for first quarter 2003. The lease will be accounted for as an operating lease.
The initial lease term is five years with two five-year renewal options and
includes a purchase option equal to the adjusted acquisition cost. The adjusted
acquisition cost is essentially equal to the final construction cost of the
project. If the Company elects to terminate or not renew the lease and not
purchase the project, then it must make a termination payment equal to the
lesser of 83.5 percent of the adjusted acquisition cost or the shortfall of
proceeds received from the sale of the project. Black Hills Corporation has
guaranteed the Agreement for Lease and Lease.

Power Purchase Agreement - Pacific Power

In 1983, the Company entered into a 40 year power purchase agreement with
Pacific Power providing for the purchase by the Company of 75 megawatts of
electric capacity and energy from Pacific Power's system. An amended agreement
signed in October 1997 reduces the contract capacity by 25 megawatts (5
megawatts per year starting in 2000). The price paid for the capacity and energy
is based on the operating costs of one of Pacific Power's coal-fired electric
generating plants. Costs incurred under this agreement were $13.9 million in
2001, $14.6 million in 2000 and $17.8 million in 1999.

Long-Term Power Sales Agreements

The Company, through its subsidiaries, has the following significant long-term
power sales contracts:

o    The Company has long-term power sales contracts with the Public Service
     Company of Colorado (PSCC) for the output of several of its plants. All of
     the output of the Company's Fountain Valley, Arapahoe and Valmont gas-fired
     facilities, totaling 400 megawatts in operation plus an additional 50
     megawatts combined-cycle expansion currently under construction, is
     included under the contracts which expire in 2012. The contracts are
     tolling arrangements in which the Company assumes no fuel price risk.

o    Beginning September 1, 2001, the Company has a ten year power sales
     contract with Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power (CLF&P) for the output of the
     40 megawatt gas-fired Gillette CT. The contract is a tolling arrangement in
     which the Company assumes no fuel risk. In addition, the Company entered
     into a ten year contract with CLF&P for 60 megawatts of contingent capacity
     from the 90 megawatt Wygen Plant, currently under construction. Twenty
     megawatts of the remaining capacity of this plant has been sold under a ten
     year contract with the Municipal Electric Agency of Nebraska.

o    The Company has secured long-term contracts for the output of the 277
     megawatt Las Vegas facility that was acquired during the third quarter of
     2001. See Note 15 for a description of the facility and the related
     long-term contracts.

o    Various long-term contracts with Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation have been
     entered into to sell the output of several of the Company's hydroelectric
     projects located in upstate New York. The Company's net ownership of
     capacity under contract is approximately 21 megawatts with contracts
     expiring between 2028 and 2032. There are additional contracts on plants
     with a net ownership capacity of approximately 21 megawatts that expire
     during 2002 and 2003.

Reclamation Liability

Under its mining permit, Wyodak Resources is required to reclaim all land where
it has mined coal reserves. The cost of reclaiming the land is accrued as the
coal is mined. While the reclamation process takes place on a continual basis,
much of the reclamation occurs over an extended period after the area is mined.
Approximately $0.7 million is charged to operations as reclamation expense
annually. As of December 31, 2001, accrued reclamation costs included in Other
liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets were approximately
$18.2 million.

Legal Proceedings

Settlement

On April 3, 2001, the Company reached a settlement of ongoing litigation with
PacifiCorp filed in the United States District Court, District of Wyoming, (File
No. 00CV-155B). The litigation concerned the parties' rights and obligations
under the Further Restated and Amended Coal Supply Agreement dated May 5, 1987,
under which PacifiCorp purchased coal from the Company's coal mine to meet the
coal requirements of the Wyodak Power Plant. The Settlement Agreement provided
for the dismissal of the litigation, with prejudice, coupled with the execution
of several new coal-related agreements between the parties discussed below. The
Company believes the value of the Settlement Agreements is equal to the net
present value of the litigated Further Restated and Amended Coal Supply
Agreement.

New Restated and Amended Coal Supply Agreement: Effective January 1, 2001, the
parties agreed to terminate the Further Restated and Amended Coal Supply
Agreement, and replace it with the New Restated and Amended Coal Supply
Agreement (New Agreement). The New Agreement began on January 1, 2001, and
extends to December 31, 2022. Under the New Agreement, the Company received an
extension of sales beyond the June 8, 2013 term of the former Coal Supply
Agreement. PacifiCorp will receive a price reduction for each ton of coal
purchased. The minimum purchase obligation under the New Agreement increased to
1,500,000 tons of coal for each calendar year of the contract term, subject to
adjustment for planned

                                       74
<PAGE>

outages. The New Agreement further provided for a special one-time payment by
PacifiCorp in the amount of $7.3 million, which was received in August 2001.
This payment primarily related to disputed billings under the previous agreement
and a value transfer premium. Of this payment, $5.6 million was recognized
currently and is included in "Other, net" non-operating income on the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income, $1.0 million was previously
recognized in revenues and the remaining $0.7 million is being recognized as
sales are made under the New Agreement.

Coal Option Agreement: The term of this agreement began October 1, 2001, and
extends until December 31, 2010. The agreement provides that PacifiCorp shall
purchase 1,400,000 tons of coal during the period of October 1, 2001 through
December 31, 2002 and 1,000,000 tons of coal in 2003 at a fixed price. The
agreement further provides the Company with a "put" option for 2002 and 2003
under which the Company may sell to PacifiCorp up to 500,000 tons of coal from
the Wyodak Mine at a market based price. For each calendar year from January 1,
2004 through 2010, the put option is increased to a maximum of 1,000,000 tons at
a market based price. The "put" tonnages will be reduced or offset for
quantities of an enhanced coal known as "K-Fuel" purchased by PacifiCorp under
the KFx Facility Output Agreement. Additionally, for each calendar year during
which the Company is selling to PacifiCorp K-Fuel under the KFx Facility Output
Agreement described below, and in which the Company has not exercised its "put"
option, PacifiCorp may elect to purchase an equal amount of tonnage from the
Company's coal reserves to use in a 50/50 blend with the K-Fuel, up to 500,000
tons per year in 2002 through 2007 at a market based price with a fixed floor.

Asset Option Agreement: This agreement provides PacifiCorp an option to purchase
a 10 percent interest in the KFx facility or the legal entity that owns the KFx
facility at a market based price.

Sale of North Conveyor System: The Company sold the "North Conveyor System" to
PacifiCorp, which served as the backup coal delivery system for the Wyodak Power
Plant which resulted in a $2.6 million gain that is included in "Other, net"
non-operating income on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

KFx Facility Output Agreement: The KFx plant is a coal enhancement facility the
Company owns located near its Wyodak Coal Mine. The KFx plant was built to
produce an enhanced coal known as "K-Fuel." Assuming the plant becomes
operational, PacifiCorp agrees to purchase K-Fuel for a term beginning January
1, 2002, and extending to December 31, 2007. If the plant is not operational on
or before December 31, 2003, the agreement will become void. Under this
agreement, PacifiCorp agrees to purchase the output of K-Fuel from the KFx
plant, up to a maximum of 500,000 tons for each calendar year from 2002 through
2007 at fixed price with market based escalation. Wyodak reserves the right to
sell up to a total of 100,000 tons from the output of the KFx plant to other
customers during the same time period.

Ongoing Litigation

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, which arise in
the ordinary course of operations. In the opinion of management, the amount of
liability, if any, with respect to these actions would not materially affect the
consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.

(11)     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (Plan) covering
the employees of the Company and those of the following subsidiaries, Black
Hills Power, Wyodak Resources Development Corp., Black Hills Exploration and
Production and Daksoft who meet certain eligibility requirements. The benefits
are based on years of service and compensation levels during the highest five
consecutive years of the last ten years of service. The Company's funding policy
is in accordance with the federal government's funding requirements. The Plan's
assets are held in trust and consist primarily of equity securities and cash
equivalents.

For measurement purposes, an 8.0 percent annual rate of increase in healthcare
benefits was assumed for 2001; the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 6.0
percent in 2005 and remain at that level thereafter. The healthcare cost trend
rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. A one percent
increase in the healthcare cost trend assumption would increase the service and
interest cost $1.0 million or 23.8 percent and the net periodic postretirement
cost $1.2 million or 28.1 percent. A one percent decrease would reduce the
service and interest cost by $0.7 million or 18.3 percent and decrease the net
periodic postretirement cost $0.8 million or 17.2 percent. The weighted-average
discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 7.5 percent.

Defined Contribution Plan

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) savings plan for eligible employees.
Participants elect to invest up to 20 percent of their eligible compensation on
a pre-tax basis. Effective January 1, 2000 (May 1, 2000 for employees covered by
the collective bargaining agreement), the Company provides a matching
contribution of 100 percent of the employee's tax-deferred contribution up to a
maximum 3 percent of the employee's eligible compensation. Matching
contributions vest at 20 percent per year and are fully vested when the
participant has 5 years of service with the Company. The Company's matching
contributions totaled $0.9 million for 2001 and $0.6 million for 2000.

(15)     ACQUISITIONS

On April 11, 2001, the Company's power generation subsidiary, Black Hills Energy
Capital, purchased the Fountain Valley facility, a 240 megawatt generation
facility located near Colorado Springs, Colorado, featuring six LM-6000
simple-cycle, gas-fired turbines. The facility came on-line mid third quarter of
2001. The facility was purchased from Enron Corporation. Total cost of the
project was approximately $183 million and has been financed primarily with
non-recourse project debt. The Company has obtained an 11-year contract with
Public Service of Colorado to utilize the facility for peaking purposes. The
contract is a tolling arrangement in which the Company assumes no fuel risk. The
transaction has been accounted for as an asset purchase recorded at cost.

On August 31, 2001, Black Hills Energy Capital purchased a 277 megawatt
gas-fired co-generation power plant project located in North Las Vegas, Nevada
from Enron North America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corporation. The
facility currently has a 53 megawatt co-generation power plant in operation.
Most of the power from that facility is under a long-term contract expiring in
2024. The Company has sold 50 percent of this power plant to other parties;
however, under generally accepted accounting principles the Company is required
to consolidate 100 percent of this plant. The project also has a 224 megawatt
combined-cycle expansion under way, which is 100 percent owned by the Company.
The facility is scheduled to be fully operational in the third quarter of 2002
and will utilize LM-6000 technology. The power of the expansion is also under a
long-term contract, which expires in 2017. This contract for the expansion
requires the purchaser to provide fuel to the power plant when it is dispatched.
The cost for the entire facility is expected to be approximately $330 million
and the Company is in the process of obtaining long-term financing, which is
expected to be primarily non-recourse project debt.

The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting
and, accordingly, the purchase price of approximately $205 million has been
allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on preliminary estimates
of the fair values of the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed as of the
date of acquisition. Fair values in the allocation include assets acquired of
approximately $157 million (excluding goodwill and other intangibles) and
liabilities assumed of approximately $2.0 million. The estimated purchase price
allocations are subject to adjustment, generally within one year of the date of
the acquisition, should new or additional facts about the acquisitions become
available, any changes to the preliminary estimates will be reflected as an
adjustment to goodwill. The purchase price and related acquisition costs
exceeded the fair values assigned to net tangible assets by approximately $57.0
million, which was recorded as long-lived intangible assets and goodwill.

In addition, during 2001, the Company acquired an additional 31 percent interest
and a 13 percent interest in its consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries, Black
Hills North American Power Fund, L.P. and Indeck North American Power Partners,
L.P., respectively, from minority shareholders. Total consideration paid was
$15.9 million.

Pro forma financial amounts reflecting the effects of the above acquisitions are
not presented as such acquisitions were not significant to the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

On July 7, 2000, the Company acquired Indeck Capital, Inc. and merged it into
its subsidiary, Black Hills Energy Capital, Inc. The acquisition was a stock
transaction with the Company issuing 1,536,747 shares of common stock to the
shareholders of Indeck priced at $21.98 per share, along with $4.0 million in
preferred stock, resulting in a purchase price of $37.8 million. Additional
consideration, consisting of common and preferred stock, may be paid in the form
of an earn-out over a four-year period beginning in 2000. As of December 31,
2001, $3.6 million has been paid under the earn-out. The earn-out consideration
is based on the acquired company's earnings during such period and cannot exceed
$35.0 million in total. Additional consideration paid out under the earn-out is
recorded as an increase to goodwill.

The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the acquired assets and
liabilities based on estimates of the fair values of the assets purchased and
the liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. Fair values in the
allocation include assets acquired of $151.1 million (excluding goodwill) and
liabilities assumed of $138.7 million. The purchase price and related
acquisition costs exceeded the fair values assigned to net tangible assets by
$25.4 million, which was recorded as goodwill and was being amortized over 25
years on a straight-line basis during 2001 and 2000.

                                       83
<PAGE>



In addition during 2000, the Company made several step-acquisitions resulting in
consolidation of $169.5 million of assets and $138.8 million of liabilities. The
related transactions are as follows:

o    Through various transactions, acquired an additional 27.11 percent interest
     in Indeck North American Power Fund, L.P. and an additional 46.66 percent
     interest in Indeck North American Power Partners, L.P., for $13.0 million
     in cash.

o    Acquired a 39.6 percent interest in each of Northern Electric Power
     Company, L.P. and South Glens Falls Limited Partnership for $4.2 million in
     cash.

o    Acquired substantially all of the partnership interests in Middle Falls
     Limited Partnership, Sissonville Limited Partnership and New York State Dam
     Limited Partnership for $12.9 million in cash.

(16)     OIL AND GAS RESERVES  (Unaudited)

Black Hills Exploration and Production has interests in 813 producing oil and
gas properties in nine states. Black Hills Exploration and Production also holds
leases on approximately 228,551 net undeveloped acres.

The following table summarizes Black Hills Exploration and Production's
quantities of proved developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves,
estimated using constant year-end product prices, as of December 31, 2001, 2000
and 1999, and a reconciliation of the changes between these dates. These
estimates are based on reserve reports by Ralph E. Davis Associates, Inc., an
independent engineering company selected by the Company. Such reserve estimates
are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, which may cause
these estimates to differ from actual results.

(18)     SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (Unaudited)

On January 4, 2002, the Company closed on a $50.0 million bridge credit
agreement. The credit agreement will supplement our revolving credit facilities
in place at December 31, 2001 and has the same terms as those facilities with an
expiration date of June 30, 2002. Outstanding borrowings under the agreement as
of February 28, 2002 were $21.1 million.

On March 8, 2002, the Company acquired an additional 67 percent ownership
interest in Millennium Pipeline Company, L.P., which owns and operates a
200-mile pipeline. The pipeline has a capacity of approximately 65,000 barrels
of oil per day, and transports imported crude oil from Beaumont, Texas to
Longview, Texas, which is the transfer point to connecting carriers. The Company
also acquired additional ownership interest in Millennium Terminal Company,
L.P., which has 1.1 million barrels of crude oil storage connected to the
Millennium Pipeline at the Oil Tanking terminal in Beaumont. The Millennium
system is presently operating near capacity through shipper agreements. These
acquisitions give the Company 100 percent ownership in the Millennium companies.
Total cost of the acquisitions was $11.0 million and was funded through
borrowings under short-term revolving credit facilities.

On March 15, 2002, the Company closed on $135 million of senior secured
financing for the Arapahoe and Valmont Facilities. These projects have a total
of 210 megawatts in service and under construction and are located in the
Denver, Colorado area. Proceeds from this financing were used to refinance $53.8
million of an existing seven-year senior secured term project-level facility,
pay down approximately $50.0 million of short-term credit facility borrowings
and approximately $31.0 million will be used for future project construction.
