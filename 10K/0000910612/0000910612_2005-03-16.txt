     Certain  statements made in this section or elsewhere in this report may be
deemed "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities
laws.   Although  the  Company  believes  the  expectations   reflected  in  any
forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions,  the Company can
give no assurance that these  expectations will be attained,  and it is possible
that  actual  results  may  differ  materially  from  those  indicated  by these
forward-looking  statements  due to a variety of risks and  uncertainties.  Such
risks and uncertainties include, without limitation,  general industry, economic
and  business  conditions,  interest  rate  fluctuations,  costs of capital  and
capital  requirements,  availability  of real estate  properties,  inability  to
consummate  acquisition  opportunities,  competition  from other  companies  and
retail formats,  changes in retail rental rates in the Company's markets, shifts
in customer demands,  tenant bankruptcies or store closings,  changes in vacancy
rates at the Company's  properties,  changes in operating  expenses,  changes in
applicable laws,  rules and  regulations,  the ability to obtain suitable equity
and/or debt financing and the continued availability of financing in the amounts
and on the terms necessary to support the Company's future business. The Company
disclaims any obligation to update or revise any  forward-looking  statements to
reflect actual results or changes in the factors  affecting the  forward-looking
information.


                                     Part I.
ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Background

     CBL & Associates  Properties,  Inc.  (the "CBL") was  organized on July 13,
1993, as a Delaware corporation, to acquire substantially all of the real estate
properties  owned  by  CBL  &  Associates,  Inc.,  and  its  affiliates  ("CBL's
Predecessor"),  which was formed by Charles B.  Lebovitz in 1978. On November 3,
1993,  CBL completed an initial public  offering (the  "Offering") of 15,400,000
shares of its common stock.  Simultaneous  with the  completion of the Offering,
CBL's  Predecessor  transferred  substantially  all of its interests in its real
estate  properties  to CBL &  Associates  Limited  Partnership  (the  "Operating
Partnership")  in exchange for common units of limited  partnership  interest in
the  Operating  Partnership.  CBL's  Predecessor  also  acquired  an  additional
interest in the Operating  Partnership for a cash payment.  The interests in the
Operating  Partnership  contain  certain  conversion  rights that are more fully
described in Note 9 to the consolidated  financial  statements.  The terms "we",
"us", "our" and the "Company" refer to CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. and its
subsidiaries.

Recent Developments

     On  January  5,  2004,  we closed  the  second  phase of our joint  venture
transaction with Galileo America, Inc. ("Galileo America REIT") when we sold our
interests in six community  centers for $92.4 million,  which consisted of $62.7
million in cash, the retirement of $26.0 million of debt on one of the community
centers,  the joint  venture's  assumption  of $2.8  million of debt and closing
costs of $0.9 million.

     We sold a community  center expansion to the joint venture during September
2004 for $3.4 million in cash.

     In October 2004,  we sold our interests in a community  center to the joint
venture for $17.9  million,  which  consisted of $2.9 million in cash, the joint
venture's assumption of $10.5 million of debt and a limited partnership interest
in Galileo  America REIT. The community  center was  originally  scheduled to be
included in the third phase of the transaction that closed in January 2005.

     We  closed  the  third  and  final  phase  of  the  Galileo  joint  venture
transaction on January 5, 2005,  when we sold our interest in two power centers,
one community center and one community center expansion for $58.6 million, which
consisted of $42.6  million in cash,  the joint  venture's  assumption  of $12.1
million of debt and $3.6 million representing our interest in the joint venture.

The Company's Business

     We are a  self-managed,  self-administered,  fully  integrated  real estate
investment  trust  ("REIT").  We own operate,  market,  manage,  lease,  expand,
develop,  redevelop,  acquire and finance regional malls and community  shopping
centers.  Our shopping center  properties are located primarily in the Southeast
and Midwest, as well as in select markets in other regions of the United States.
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal  income tax  purposes.  We are
the fourth largest mall REIT in the United States and the largest owner of malls
and shopping centers in the Southeast based on gross leasable area owned.

     We  conduct  substantially  all  of  our  business  through  the  Operating
Partnership.  We are the 100%  owner of two  qualified  REIT  subsidiaries,  CBL
Holdings I, Inc.  and CBL  Holdings  II, Inc.  CBL  Holdings I, Inc. is the sole
general partner of the Operating Partnership. At December 31, 2004, CBL Holdings
I, Inc.  owned a 1.6%  general  partnership  interest  and CBL Holdings II, Inc.
owned a 53.4% limited partnership interest in the Operating  Partnership,  for a
combined interest held by us of 55.0%.

As of December 31, 2004, we owned:

          |X|  interests  in a portfolio of  operating  properties  including 69
               enclosed regional malls (the "Malls"), 26 associated centers (the
               "Associated  Centers"),  60  community  centers  (the  "Community
               Centers")  and  our  corporate   office   building  (the  "Office
               Building");

          |X|  interests  in  one  regional  mall,  one  open-air  center,   two
               associated   centers,   one  associated  center  expansion,   one
               associated center  redevelopment and three community centers that
               are currently under construction (the "Construction Properties"),
               as well as options to acquire certain shopping center development
               sites; and

          |X|  mortgages on ten properties  that are secured by first  mortgages
               or  wrap-around  mortgages  on the  underlying  real  estate  and
               related improvements (the "Mortgages").

     The Malls, Associated Centers, Community Centers,  Construction Properties,
Mortgages and Office Building are  collectively  referred to as the "Properties"
and individually as a "Property."

     We conduct our property management and development activities through CBL &
Associates  Management,  Inc. (the "Management  Company") to comply with certain
technical requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

     The Management  Company manages all of the Properties except for Governor's
Square and  Governor's  Plaza in  Clarksville,  TN and  Kentucky  Oaks Mall,  in
Paducah, KY. A property manager affiliated with the third party managing general
partner  performs the property  management  services  for these  Properties  and
receives  a fee  for its  services.  The  managing  partner  of  each  of  these
Properties  controls  the cash flow  distributions,  although  our  approval  is
required for certain major decisions.

     The majority of our revenues is derived from leases with retail tenants and
generally  include  minimum  rents,  percentage  rents based on  tenants'  sales
volumes and  reimbursements  from tenants for  expenditures  related to property
operating expenses, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance and repairs, as
well as certain capital  expenditures.  We also generate  revenues from sales of
peripheral  land at the  properties and from sales of real estate assets when it
is determined that we can realize the maximum value of the assets. Proceeds from
such sales are generally used to reduce borrowings on our credit facilities.

     The  following  terms used in this annual report on Form 10-K will have the
meanings described below:

          |X|  GLA - refers to gross  leasable  area of  retail  space in square
               feet, including anchors and mall tenants

          |X|  Anchor - refers to a department store or other large retail store

                                       5
<PAGE>

          |X|  Freestanding  - property  locations  that are not attached to the
               primary  complex of buildings  that  comprise  the mall  shopping
               center

          |X|  Outparcel  - land  used for  freestanding  developments,  such as
               retail  stores,  banks and  restaurants,  on the periphery of the
               Properties

Geographic Concentration

     Our properties are located  principally in the  southeastern and midwestern
Unites  States.  Our  properties  located  in  the  southeastern  United  States
accounted for approximately  57.0% of our total revenues from all properties for
the year ended December 31, 2004 and currently  include 37 Malls,  18 Associated
Centers,  35  Community  Centers and one Office  Building  and.  Our  properties
located in the midwestern United States accounted for approximately 24.9% of our
total  revenues  from all  properties  for the year ended  December 31, 2004 and
currently include 18 Malls, three Associated Centers and five Community Centers.
Our results of operations and funds  available for  distribution to shareholders
therefore will be subject  generally to economic  conditions in the southeastern
and midwestern  United  States.  We will continue to look for  opportunities  to
geographically  diversify our  portfolio in order to minimize  dependency on any
particular  region;  however,  the  expansion  of  the  portfolio  through  both
acquisitions and developments is contingent on many factors  including  consumer
demand, competition and economic conditions.

Significant Markets

Our Growth Strategy

         Our objective is to achieve growth in funds from operations by
maximizing cash flows through a variety of methods that are discussed below.

Leasing, Management and Marketing

         Our objective is to maximize cash flows from our existing Properties
through:

          |X|  aggressive leasing that seeks to increase occupancy,

          |X|  originating  and renewing  leases at higher base rents per square
               foot compared to the previous lease,

          |X|  merchandising, marketing and promotional activities and

          |X|  aggressively  controlling  operating  costs and tenant  occupancy
               costs.

Expansions and Renovations

     We can create  additional  revenue by  expanding  a  Property  through  the
addition of  department  stores,  mall  stores and large  format  retailers.  An
expansion also protects the Property's  competitive  position within its market.
As shown below,  we completed six  expansions  during 2004 and will expand seven
Properties in 2005:

     Renovations usually include renovating  existing facades,  uniform signage,
new entrances and floor coverings,  updating interior decor, resurfacing parking
lots and improving the lighting of interiors and parking lots.  Renovations  can
result in attracting new retailers,  increased rental rates and occupancy levels
and in maintaining the Property's market dominance. As shown below, we renovated
three Properties during 2004 and will renovate two Properties during 2005.

 Development of New Retail Properties

     In general, we seek development  opportunities in middle-market trade areas
that  we  believe  are  under-served  by  existing  retail   operations.   These
middle-markets  must also have  sufficient  demographic  trends to  provide  the
opportunity to effectively maintain a competitive position.  The following shows
the  new   developments   we  opened  during  2004  and  those  currently  under
construction:

Acquisitions

malls and other  associated  properties.  We selectively  acquire  regional mall
properties  where we believe we can increase  the value of the property  through
our  development,  leasing and management  expertise.  We acquired the following

Risks Associated with Our Growth Strategy

     As with any  strategy  there are risks  involved  with our plan for growth.
Such risks include,  but are not limited to: development  opportunities  pursued
may be abandoned;  construction  costs may exceed estimates;  construction loans
with full recourse to us may not be  refinanced;  proforma  objectives,  such as


                                       9
<PAGE>

occupancy and rental rates, may not be achieved; and the required approval by an
anchor   tenant,   mortgage   lender  or  joint  venture   partner  for  certain
expansion/development   activities   may  not  be  obtained.   An   unsuccessful
development project could result in a loss greater than our investment.

Insurance

     We carry a comprehensive blanket policy for liability, fire and rental loss
insurance covering all of the Properties, with specifications and insured limits
customarily carried for similar properties. The property and liability insurance
policies on our Properties  currently do not exclude loss resulting from acts of
terrorism, whether foreign or domestic. We believe the Properties are adequately
insured in accordance with industry standards.

Environmental Matters

     Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations,  a
current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs
of removal or remediation of petroleum,  certain  hazardous or toxic  substances
on,  under or in such real estate.  Such laws  typically  impose such  liability
without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for,
the presence of such  substances.  The costs of  remediation  or removal of such
substances may be substantial.  The presence of such substances,  or the failure
to promptly  remediate  such  substances,  may  adversely  affect the owner's or
operator's  ability  to lease or sell such real  estate or to borrow  using such
real estate as collateral.  Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of
hazardous  or toxic  substances  may also be liable  for the costs of removal or
remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility, regardless
of whether such facility is owned or operated by such person.  Certain laws also
impose requirements on conditions and activities that may affect the environment
or the impact of the  environment  on human health.  Failure to comply with such
requirements  could result in the imposition of monetary  penalties (in addition
to the costs to achieve compliance) and potential  liabilities to third parties.
Among other  things,  certain laws  require  abatement or removal of friable and
certain non-friable  asbestos-containing materials in the event of demolition or
certain  renovations or remodeling.  Certain laws regarding  asbestos-containing
materials require building owners and lessees, among other things, to notify and
train  certain   employees  working  in  areas  known  or  presumed  to  contain
asbestos-containing materials. Certain laws also impose liability for release of
asbestos-containing  materials  into the air and third parties may seek recovery
from owners or operators  of real  properties  for  personal  injury or property
damage  associated with  asbestos-containing  materials.  In connection with the
ownership and operation of properties, we may be potentially liable for all or a
portion of such costs or claims.

     All of our  properties  (but not  properties for which we hold an option to
purchase  but do not yet  own)  have  been  subject  to  Phase  I  environmental
assessments  or updates of existing  Phase I  environmental  assessments  within
approximately  the last ten years.  Such assessments  generally  consisted of a
visual inspection of the properties,  review of federal and state  environmental
databases and certain  information  regarding  historic uses of the property and
adjacent areas and the preparation and issuance of written reports.  Some of the
properties  contain,  or contained,  underground  storage tanks used for storing
petroleum  products or wastes  typically  associated with automobile  service or
other operations  conducted at the properties.  Certain properties  contain,  or
contained,  dry-cleaning establishments utilizing solvents. Where believed to be
warranted,  samplings of building  materials or subsurface  investigations  were
undertaken.  At certain properties,  where warranted by the conditions,  we have
developed and implemented an operations and maintenance program that establishes
operating procedures with respect to  asbestos-containing  materials.  The costs
associated  with the development  and  implementation  of such programs were not
material.

     We believe that our properties  are in compliance in all material  respects
with all federal,  state and local  ordinances  and  regulations  regarding  the
handling,  discharge and emission of hazardous or toxic substances.  We have not
been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise aware, of any
material  noncompliance,  liability  or claim  relating  to  hazardous  or toxic
substances in connection with any of our present or former  properties.  We have
not recorded in our financial  statements  any material  liability in connection
with environmental matters.  Nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental


                                       10
<PAGE>

assessments   available  to  us  do  not  reveal  all  potential   environmental
liabilities.  It is also possible that subsequent  investigations  will identify
material  contamination,  that  adverse  environmental  conditions  have  arisen
subsequent to the performance of the  environmental  assessments,  or that there
are material environmental liabilities of which management is unaware. Moreover,
no assurances can be given that (i) future laws,  ordinances or regulations will
not  impose  any   material   environmental   liability   or  (ii)  the  current
environmental  condition of the  properties has not been or will not be affected
by tenants and  occupants of the  properties,  by the condition of properties in
the  vicinity  of the  properties  or by  third  parties  unrelated  to us,  the
Operating Partnership or the relevant property's  partnership.  The existence of
any such environmental  liability could have an adverse effect on our results of
operations, cash flow and the funds available to us to pay dividends.

Competition

     The  Properties  compete with various  shopping  facilities  in  attracting
retailers  to  lease  space.  In  addition,  retailers  at our  properties  face
continued  competition from discount shopping centers,  outlet malls,  wholesale
clubs, direct mail, television shopping networks,  the internet and other retail
shopping  developments.  The extent of the retail competition varies from market
to  market.   We  work  aggressively  to  attract  customers  through  marketing
promotions and campaigns.

Seasonality

     Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with tenant sales achieving the
highest  levels during the fourth  quarter  because of the holiday  season.  The
Malls earn most of their  "temporary"  rents  (rents  from  short-term  tenants)
during the holiday period.  Thus,  occupancy  levels and revenue  production are
generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year.  Results of operations
realized in any one quarter may not be  indicative  of the results  likely to be
experienced over the course of the entire year.

Qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT")

     We intend to continue to be taxed as a REIT under  Sections 856 through 860
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code").  We generally will not be
subject to federal  income tax to the extent we  distribute  at least 90% of our
REIT ordinary  taxable  income to our  shareholders.  If we fail to qualify as a
REIT in any  taxable  year,  we would be subject  to  federal  income tax on our
taxable income at regular corporate rates.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

     Refer  to Item 7:  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  for  additional
information pertaining to the Properties' performance.


Malls

     We own a controlling interest in 64 Malls and non-controlling  interests in
five Malls. We also own a  non-controlling  interest in a Mall that is currently
under  construction.  The Malls are primarily located in middle markets and have
strong  competitive  positions because they are the only, or dominant,  regional
mall in their respective trade areas.

     The Malls are  generally  anchored by two or more  department  stores and a
wide  variety of mall  stores.  Anchor  tenants  own or lease  their  stores and
non-anchor stores (20,000 square feet or less) lease their locations. Additional
freestanding  stores and  restaurants  that either own or lease their stores are
typically located along the perimeter of the Malls' parking areas.

     We classify our Malls into two categories - Malls that have completed their
initial  lease-up  are referred to as  "stabilized  malls" and Malls that are in
their initial  lease-up  phase are referred to as  "non-stabilized  malls".  The
non-stabilized  malls  currently  include The Lakes Mall in Muskegon,  MI, which
opened in August 2001; Parkway Place in Huntsville,  AL, which opened in October
2002; and Coastal  Grand-Myrtle Beach in Myrtle Beach, SC, which opened in March
2004.

     We own the land  underlying  each Mall in fee simple  interest,  except for
Walnut  Square,  WestGate Mall,  St. Clair Square,  Bonita Lakes Mall,  Meridian
Mall, Stroud Mall,  Wausau Center,  Chapel Hill Mall and Eastgate Mall. We lease
all or a portion of the land at each of these Malls subject to long-term  ground
lease.

     The following table sets forth certain information for each of the Malls as
of December 31, 2004.

Anchors

     Anchors are an important  factor in a Mall's  successful  performance.  The
public's  identification  with a mall property  typically  focuses on the anchor
tenants. Mall anchors are generally a department store whose merchandise appeals
to a broad range of shoppers and plays a significant role in generating customer
traffic and creating a desirable location for the mall store tenants.

     Anchors  may own  their  stores  and the  land  underneath,  as well as the
adjacent parking areas, or may enter into long-term leases with respect to their
stores.  Rental rates for anchor tenants are significantly  lower than the rents
charged to mall store  tenants.  Anchors  account for 5.5% of the total revenues
from our  Properties.  Each  anchor  that  owns its store  has  entered  into an
operating  and  reciprocal  easement  agreement  with us covering  items such as
operating  covenants,   reciprocal  easements,   property  operations,   initial
construction and future expansion.

     During 2004, we added the following anchors to the following Malls:

Associated Centers

     We  own  a   controlling   interest   in  26   Associated   Centers  and  a
non-controlling  interest in one  Associated  Center.  We also own a controlling
interest in two Associated  Centers that were under construction at December 31,
2004.

     Associated  Centers are retail  properties  that are adjacent to a regional
mall complex and include one or more anchors,  or big box retailers,  along with
smaller  tenants.  Anchor  tenants  typically  include  tenants such as TJ Maxx,
Target,  Toys R Us and Goody's.  Associated  Centers are managed by the staff at
the Mall it is adjacent to and usually  benefit from the customers  drawn to the
Mall.

     The  following  table  sets  forth  certain  information  for  each  of the
Associated Centers as of December 31, 2004:

Community Centers

     We own a controlling interest in 12 Community Centers and a non-controlling
interest in 48  Community  Centers.  We also own  controlling  interest in three
Community  Centers that are currently under  construction.  Galileo America LLC,
our joint venture with Galileo America, Inc., owns the 48 community centers that
we have a noncontrolling  interest in (see Note 5 to the consolidated  financial
statements for a description of this joint venture).  The  information  provided
herein for the Community Centers does not include these 48 Community Centers.

     Community  Centers  typically have less development risk because of shorter
development  periods and lower costs. While Community Centers generally maintain
higher  occupancy  levels and are more stable,  they  typically have slower rent
growth because the anchor  stores' rents are typically  fixed and are for longer
terms.

     Community Centers are designed to attract local and regional area customers
and are typically  anchored by a combination of  supermarkets,  or  value-priced
stores that attract  shoppers to each center's  small shops.  The tenants at our
Community Centers typically offer  necessities,  value-oriented  and convenience
merchandise.

     The  Percentage  GLA  Occupied(3)   following  tables  sets  forth  certain
information for each of our Community Centers at December 31, 2004:

Item 7: Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

     The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations  should  be read  in  conjunction  with  the  consolidated  financial
statements  and  accompanying  notes that are  included in this  annual  report.
Capitalized  terms used, but not defined,  in this  Management's  Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have the same meanings
as  defined  in the  notes to the  consolidated  financial  statements.  In this
discussion,  the  terms  "we",  "us",  "our"  and the  "Company"  refer to CBL &
Associates Properties, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

     Certain  statements made in this section or elsewhere in this report may be
deemed "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities
laws.  Although we believe the  expectations  reflected  in any  forward-looking
statements  are based on reasonable  assumptions,  we can give no assurance that
these expectations will be attained,  and it is possible that actual results may
differ materially from those indicated by these  forward-looking  statements due
to a variety of risks and uncertainties.  Such risks and uncertainties  include,
without limitation, general industry, economic and business conditions, interest
rate fluctuations,  costs of capital and capital  requirements,  availability of
real estate  properties,  inability  to  consummate  acquisition  opportunities,
competition  from other companies and retail  formats,  changes in retail rental
rates in our markets,  shifts in customer demands,  tenant bankruptcies or store
closings,  changes  in vacancy  rates at our  properties,  changes in  operating
expenses,  changes in applicable  laws,  rules and  regulations,  the ability to
obtain suitable  equity and/or debt financing and the continued  availability of
financing  in the  amounts  and on the terms  necessary  to  support  our future
business.  We disclaim any  obligation  to update or revise any  forward-looking
statements  to reflect  actual  results or changes in the factors  affecting the
forward-looking information.

Executive Overview

     We are a  self-managed,  self-administered,  fully  integrated  real estate
investment  trust  ("REIT")  that  is  engaged  in the  ownership,  development,
acquisition,  leasing,  management and operation of regional  shopping malls and
community  centers.  Our shopping center properties are located primarily in the
Southeast  and  Midwest,  as well as in select  markets in other  regions of the
United States.

     As of December  31,  2004,  we owned  controlling  interests in 64 regional
malls,  25 associated  centers (each adjacent to a regional  mall), 12 community
centers,  and our  corporate  office  building.  We  consolidate  the  financial
statements of all entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. As
of December 31, 2004, we owned non-controlling interests in five regional malls,
one associated center and 48 community centers.  Because major decisions such as
the acquisition,  sale or refinancing of principal  partnership or joint venture
assets must be approved by one or more of the other partners,  we do not control
these  partnerships  and joint  ventures  and,  accordingly,  account  for these
investments  using the equity method. We had one mall, which is owned in a joint
venture,  two mall  expansions,  one open-air  shopping  center,  two associated
centers,  one of  which  is  owned in a joint  venture,  one  associated  center
expansion, one associated center redevelopment and three community centers under
construction as of December 31, 2004.

     The majority of our revenues is derived from leases with retail tenants and
generally  include  minimum  rents,  percentage  rents based on  tenants'  sales
volumes and  reimbursements  from tenants for  expenditures  related to property
operating  expenses,  real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs,  as well as
certain capital expenditures. We also generate revenues from sales of peripheral
land  at the  properties  and  from  sales  of  real  estate  assets  when it is
determined  that we can realize the maximum  value of the assets.  Proceeds from
such sales are generally used to reduce borrowings on our credit facilities.

     We expanded our portfolio in 2004 with the acquisition of eight malls,  two
associated  centers and a community  center,  representing a total investment of
$950.0  million.  We opened nine new  developments  totaling 1.9 million  square
feet,  including  the nearly 1.0  million  square  foot  regional  mall  Coastal
Grand-Myrtle Beach in Myrtle Beach, SC, which we own in a joint venture. We have


                                       29
<PAGE>

approximately 2.0 million square feet of new developments,  which represent over
$185.0 million of net investment, that is scheduled to open during 2005. We also
added a total of 12 big box  stores  and eight  anchor  retailers  to our malls,
which have made positive  contributions by strengthening the tenant mix of these
properties.

operations  for the year ended  December  31,  2004,  compared to the year ended
December 31, 2003:

     |X|  The  acquisition  of  eight  malls,  two  associated  centers  and one
          community center,  and the opening of one new mall (which is accounted
          for using the equity method),  one associated center and one community
          center  during  2004.  Additionally,  2004 was the first  full year of
          operations  for the six malls  and two  associated  centers  that were
          acquired  during 2003 and the one associated  center and two community
          centers that were opened in 2003.  The  properties  opened or acquired
          during  2004 and 2003 are  collectively  referred  to as the "New 2004
          Properties" in this section and are as follows:

     |X|  In October 2003, we sold 41 community  centers to Galileo America.  We
          sold six additional  community  centers to Galileo  America in January
          2004.  Since we have  continuing  involvement  with  these  properties
          through  our  ownership  interest  in Galileo  America and our role as
          manager  of  the  properties,  the  results  of  operations  of  these
          properties  have  not  been  reflected  in  discontinued   operations.
          Therefore,  the year  ended  December  31,  2003  includes  results of
          operations for these properties through the dates they were sold.

     |X|  Effective  January 1, 2004,  we began to  consolidate  the  results of
          operations  of PPG  Venture  I  Limited  Partnership,  which  owns two
          community centers and one associated center (the "PPG Properties"), as
          a result of the adoption of a new  accounting  pronouncement.  The PPG
          Properties were accounted for as  unconsolidated  affiliates using the
          equity method of accounting prior to January 1, 2004.

     |X|  Properties  that were in operation  for the entire  period during 2004
          and 2003 are referred to as the "2004  Comparable  Properties" in this
          section.

Revenues

     The $93.2  million  increase  in revenues  was  primarily  attributable  to
increases of $113.6 million from the New 2004  Properties,  $7.5 million related
to the PPG  Properties  and $4.4  million from the 2004  Comparable  Properties.
These  increases were offset by a reduction in revenues of $42.5 million related
to the community  centers that were sold to Galileo  America in October 2003 and
January 2004.

     The increase in revenues of the 2004  Comparable  Properties  was driven by
our ability to maintain high occupancy  levels,  while  achieving an increase of
3.3% in rents from both new leases and lease renewals for comparable  small shop
spaces.

     An increase in  management  and leasing fees of $2.8 million  received from
Galileo  America was the primary  contributor  to the $4.3  million  increase in
management,  development and leasing fees. Other revenues increased $5.9 million
due to growth of our taxable REIT subsidiary.

Operating Expenses

     Property operating expenses including real estate taxes and maintenance and
repairs,  increased as a result of increases of $35.7  million from the New 2004
Properties and $2.2 million from the PPG Properties, offset by decreases of $9.4
million  related to the community  centers that were sold to Galileo America and
$5.5 million in operating expenses of the 2004 Comparable Properties.

     The  increase  in  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  resulted  from
increases of $29.0 million from the New 2004 Properties, $1.0 million related to
the PPG Properties and $6.6 million from the 2004 Comparable  Properties.  These
increases  were offset by a decrease of $7.4  million  related to the  community
centers that we sold to Galileo  America in October 2003 and January  2004.  The
increase  attributable  to the  2004  Comparable  Properties  is due to  ongoing
capital expenditures for renovations, expansions, tenant allowances and deferred
maintenance.

     General and administrative  expenses increased $4.9 million during 2004. As
a percentage of revenues, this was only a 0.1% increase over the comparable 2003
amount.  General and administrative  expenses were significantly  impacted by an
additional  $1.1 million of expenses in 2004 related to compliance  with Section
404 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002.  State tax expenses also increased $1.8
million as a result of our  continued  growth.  The remainder of the increase is
attributable  to  additional  salaries and benefits for the  personnel  added to
manage  the  properties  acquired  during  2004 and 2003  combined  with  annual
compensation increases for existing personnel.

     We identified  ten  community  centers and recorded a loss on impairment of
real  estate  assets of $3.1  million  to  reduce  the  carrying  value of these
properties to their respective  estimated fair values. The ten community centers
include four community  centers that we sold to Galileo America in January 2005,
five  community  centers that we expect to sell during the first quarter of 2005
and one community  center that was sold for a loss during the fourth  quarter of
2004.



                                       31
<PAGE>

Other Income and Expenses

     Interest expense  increased $23.9 million  primarily due to the debt on the
New 2004 Properties and the PPG Properties, as well as the additional financings
that were obtained on the 2004 Comparable Properties. The increase was offset by
a reduction in interest  expense  related to the Galileo  Transaction as well as
normal principal amortization.

     The gain on sales of real estate  assets of $29.3  million in 2004 included
$26.8  million of gain  related to the Galileo  Transaction  and $2.5 million of
gain on sales of seven outparcels at various properties.

     Equity in earnings of unconsolidated  affiliates  increased by $5.4 million
in 2004 as a result of our  interest  in  Galileo  America  and the  opening  of
Coastal Grand-Myrtle Beach in March 2004.

     We sold  two  community  centers  during  2004  for a gain on  discontinued
operations  of $0.9  million.  We sold one  community  center for a loss of $0.1
million,  which  was  included  in loss on  impairment  of real  estate  assets.
Operating  income from  discontinued  operations  decreased  in 2004 because the
properties  were  owned for a shorter  period of time in 2004 than in 2003,  and
because 2003 includes the operations of properties that were sold during 2003.

Comparison  of the Year Ended  December 31, 2003 to the Year Ended  December 31,
2002

     The following significant transactions impacted the consolidated results of
operations  for the year ended  December  31,  2003,  compared to the year ended
December 31, 2002:

     |X|  The  acquisition  of six  malls  and two  associated  centers  and the
          opening of one new  associated  center and two new  community  centers
          during 2003. Additionally, there was a full year of operations in 2003
          for three malls and one  associated  center that were acquired  during
          2002 and one associated center that was opened in 2002. The properties
          opened or acquired during 2003 and 2002 are  collectively  referred to

     |X|  The  consolidation  of a full year of operations  for East Towne Mall,
          West Towne  Mall and West  Towne  Crossing  (the  "Newly  Consolidated
          Properties")  in which we acquired the  remaining  ownership  interest
          during  December  2002.  We had  previously  owned  a  non-controlling
          interest  in these  properties  and had  accounted  for them using the
          equity method of accounting.

     |X|  The sale of interests in 41  community  centers to Galileo  America in
          October 2003 ("the Galileo Transaction").

     |X|  Properties  that were in operation  for the entire  period during 2003
          and 2002 are referred to as the "2003  Comparable  Properties" in this
          section.

Revenues

     The $80.2  million  increase  in revenues  was  primarily  attributable  to
increases of $44.7 million from the New 2003 Properties,  $23.6 million from the
Newly  Consolidated  Properties and $20.2 million from  properties  that were in
operation  for all of 2003 and 2002,  offset by a reduction of $6.7 million from
the Galileo Transaction.

     The increase in revenues at  properties  that were in operation  for all of
2003 and 2002 was  primarily  driven by our ability to maintain  high  occupancy
levels  while  achieving  increases  in rents  from  both new  leases  and lease
renewals on comparable spaces. Additionally, our cost recovery ratio improved to
99.2% in 2003 compared to 91.4% in 2002 due primarily to the partial recovery of
certain capital expenditures  incurred in connection with the significant number
of mall renovations completed during the past three years.

     Management,  leasing and development fees decreased $1.6 million because of
a reduction in fees related to the Newly Consolidated Properties.

Operating Expenses

     Property  operating  expenses  (including real estate taxes and maintenance
and repairs)  increased $19.6 million due to increases of $15.5 million from the
New 2003  Properties  and $7.0 million from the Newly  Consolidated  Properties,
offset by a reduction of $2.9 million from the Galileo Transaction.

     The  $19.5  million  increase  in  depreciation  and  amortization  expense
resulted  from  increases  of $9.2 million  from the New 2003  Properties,  $4.2
million  from  the  Newly  Consolidated  Properties  and $7.1  million  from the
comparable  centers,   which  is  primarily  attributable  to  the  16  property
renovations  and  expansions  that were  completed  during 2003 and 2002.  These
increases  were  offset  by  a  reduction  of  $1.0  million  from  the  Galileo
Transaction.

     General and administrative expenses increased $7.1 million because we had a
lower  level of  development  activity  in 2003 than in 2002.  As a  result,  we
capitalized  less in  salaries  of  leasing  and  development  personnel,  which
resulted in higher compensation expense. There were also additional salaries and
benefits for the personnel  added to manage the properties  acquired during 2003
and 2002 combined with annual compensation increases for existing personnel.

Other Income and Expenses

     Interest  expense  increased  $10.4 million due to the debt on the New 2003
Properties and the Newly  Consolidated  Properties.  We also  refinanced  $196.0
million  of  short-term,   variable-rate  debt  with  fixed-rate,   non-recourse
long-term debt with a higher  interest rate. The increase was offset somewhat by
a reduction  in debt  related to the Galileo  Transaction  and normal  principal
amortization. While converting to fixed-rate debt is dilutive in the short-term,
it is consistent with our strategy of minimizing  exposure to variable-rate debt
when we can obtain  fixed-rate  debt on terms that are deemed  favorable for the
long-term.

                                       33
<PAGE>

     The net gain on sales of real  estate  assets of $77.8  million in 2003 was
primarily  attributable  to the $71.9  million  gain  recognized  on the Galileo
Transaction. The remaining $5.9 million of gain was related to gains on sales of
20  outparcels  at various  properties  and sales of two  options  on  potential
development sites.

     Equity in earnings of unconsolidated  affiliates  decreased by $3.3 million
in 2003 as a  result  of the  Newly  Consolidated  Properties  no  longer  being
accounted for using the equity method.

     We sold  six  community  centers  during  2003  for a gain on  discontinued
operations  of $4.0  million.  Operating  income  from  discontinued  operations
decreased in 2003 because the properties were owned for a shorter period of time
in 2003 than in 2002,  and because 2002  includes the  operations  of properties
that were sold during 2002.

Operational Review

     The shopping  center  business is, to some extent,  seasonal in nature with
tenants  achieving the highest levels of sales during the fourth quarter because
of the holiday  season.  Additionally,  the malls earn most of their  short-term
rents during the holiday period.  Thus,  occupancy levels and revenue production
are  generally  the  highest  in the fourth  quarter  of each  year.  Results of
operations  realized  in any one quarter  may not be  indicative  of the results
likely to be experienced over the course of the fiscal year.

     We  classify  our  regional  malls  into two  categories  - malls that have
completed their initial lease-up are referred to as "stabilized malls" and malls
that are in their  initial  lease-up  phase are  referred to as  "non-stabilized
malls". The  non-stabilized  malls currently include The Lakes Mall in Muskegon,
MI, which opened in August 2001;  Parkway Place in Huntsville,  AL, which opened
in October  2002;  and Coastal  Grand-Myrtle  Beach in Myrtle  Beach,  SC, which
opened in March 2004.

     We derive a significant  amount of our revenues  from the mall  properties.
The sources of our revenues by property type were as follows:

Sales and Occupancy Costs

     Mall store sales (for those  tenants who occupy  10,000 square feet or less
and  have  reported  sales)  in the  stabilized  malls  increased  by  2.8% on a
comparable  per square foot basis to $314 per square foot for 2004 compared with
$305 per square foot for 2003.

     Occupancy  costs as a  percentage  of sales for the  stabilized  malls were
12.0% and 12.2% for 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Occupancy

     Total portfolio  occupancy  increased 90 basis points to 94.0%.  Since June
2003, we experienced 118 store closings,  totaling  approximately 457,000 square
feet and representing approximately $8.1 million in annual minimum base rent. As
of December 31, 2004, we had re-leased approximately 217,000 square feet of this
space at rents per square foot that are 3.5% higher than the  previous  rent and
at comparable rents based on total annual base rent. Our portfolio  occupancy is
summarized in the following table:

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     There was $25.8 million of  unrestricted  cash and cash  equivalents  as of
December 31, 2004,  an increase of $5.4  million  from  December 31, 2003.  Cash
flows from  operations are used to fund  short-term  liquidity and capital needs
such as tenant  construction  allowances,  capital  expenditures and payments of
dividends  and   distributions.   For   longer-term   liquidity  needs  such  as
acquisitions, new developments, renovations and expansions, we typically rely on
property specific mortgages (which are generally non-recourse), construction and
term loans,  revolving lines of credit,  common stock,  preferred  stock,  joint
venture investments and a minority interest in the Operating Partnership.

     Cash  provided by operating  activities  increased  $64.8 million to $339.2
million  for the year ended  December  31,  2004.  The  increase  was  primarily
attributable to the operations of the New 2004  Properties and improved  results
at the 2004 Comparable Properties.

Debt

      The following tables summarize debt based on our pro rata ownership share,
including our pro rata share of unconsolidated affiliates and excluding minority
investors' share of consolidated properties, because we believe this provides
investors a clearer understanding of our total debt obligations and liquidity

     In August  2004,  we entered  into a new $400.0  million  unsecured  credit
facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 100 to 145 basis points
based on our leverage, as defined in the agreement.  The credit facility matures
in August 2006 and we have three one-year extension options.  We used borrowings
on the credit  facility  to repay all of the  outstanding  borrowings  under our
previous $130.0 million unsecured credit facility, which had an interest rate of
LIBOR plus 1.30% and was scheduled to mature in September  2004. At December 31,
2004,  total  outstanding  borrowings  of $39.9  million  under  the new  credit
facility had a weighted average interest rate of 3.54%.

     We currently have four secured lines of credit with total  availability  of
$483.0 million that are used for  construction,  acquisition and working capital
purposes.  Each of  these  lines is  secured  by  mortgages  on  certain  of our
operating properties.  There were total borrowings of $421.5 million outstanding
at a weighted average interest rate of 3.36% as of December 31, 2004.

     We also have  secured  lines of credit  with  total  availability  of $27.1
million  that can only be used to issue  letters  of  credit.  There  was  $12.3
million outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2004.

     We obtained a $57.3 million,  nonrecourse  loan secured by Eastgate Mall in
Cincinnati, OH that bears interest at 4.55% and matures in December 2009.

     We assumed $304.6 million of debt and obtained an additional $272.6 million
of debt to fund the  acquisitions  completed during 2004. The assumed loans bear
interest at stated fixed rates ranging from 5.73% to 8.69% and mature at various
dates from March 2009 to December 2014.  Since the stated  interest rates on the
fixed-rate  loans were above market rates for similar debt instruments as of the
respective dates of acquisition, debt premiums of $19.5 million were recorded to
reflect the assumed debt at estimated  fair values.  Including the effect of the
related debt premiums,  the effective  interest rates on the assumed loans range
from 4.75% to 5.50%.  The additional  loans include $159.2 million of loans that
bear  interest  at LIBOR plus 100 basis  points and mature in April 2006 and May
2006, and a fixed-rate,  interest-only,  nonrecourse loan of $113.4 million that
bears interest at 5.04% and matures in December 2014.

     The  secured  and  unsecured  credit   facilities   contain,   among  other
restrictions,  certain financial  covenants including the maintenance of certain
coverage ratios,  minimum net worth  requirements,  and limitations on cash flow
distributions.   We  were  in  compliance  with  all  financial   covenants  and


                                       36

restrictions  under our credit  facilities  at December 31, 2004.  Additionally,
certain property-specific mortgage notes payable require the maintenance of debt
service  coverage ratios on their respective  properties.  At December 31, 2004,
the properties  subject to these mortgage notes payable were in compliance  with
the applicable ratios.

     We expect to refinance  the  majority of mortgage  and other notes  payable
maturing over the next five years with replacement  loans. Based on our pro rata
share of total debt,  there is $67.7 million of debt that is scheduled to mature
in 2005.  There are  extension  options in place to extend the maturity of $30.0
million of this debt to 2006. We repaid $10.6 million of these loans  subsequent
to  December  31,  2004,  and  expect to repay the  remaining  $27.1  million of
maturing loans.

Equity

     On December 13, 2004,  we issued  7,000,000  depositary  shares in a public
offering,  each representing  one-tenth of a share of 7.375% Series D Cumulative
Redeemable  Preferred Stock (the "Series D Preferred  Stock") with a liquidation
preference of $250.00 per share ($25.00 per depositary  share). The dividends on
the Series D Preferred  Stock are  cumulative,  accrue from the date of issuance
and are payable  quarterly in arrears at a rate of $18.4375 per share  ($1.84375
per  depositary  share) per annum.  The Series D  Preferred  Stock has no stated
maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption, and is not
redeemable  before  December 13, 2009.  The net proceeds of $169.3  million were
used to reduce outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities.

     We received $15.8 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock during
2004 from exercises of employee stock options,  our dividend  reinvestment  plan
and our employee stock purchase plan.

     During 2004, we paid  dividends of $106.9  million to holders of our common
stock and our preferred  stock, as well as $78.5 million in distributions to the
minority  interest  investors in our Operating  Partnership and certain shopping
center properties.

     As a publicly  traded  company,  we have access to capital through both the
public  equity  and  debt  markets.  We have  an  effective  shelf  registration
statement  authorizing  us to publicly issue shares of preferred  stock,  common
stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock with an aggregate  public
offering price up to $562.0  million,  of which $272.0 million remains after the
Series D Preferred Stock offering.

     We anticipate that the combination of equity and debt sources will, for the
foreseeable future,  provide adequate liquidity to continue our capital programs
substantially  as in the past  and make  distributions  to our  shareholders  in
accordance with the requirements applicable to real estate investment trusts.

     Our   policy   is   to   maintain   a   conservative   debt-to-total-market
capitalization  ratio in order to enhance  our access to the  broadest  range of
capital  markets,  both  public  and  private.  Based  on  our  share  of  total
consolidated  and  unconsolidated  debt and the market value of our equity,  our
debt-to-total-market capitalization (debt plus market-value equity) ratio was as

Capital Expenditures

     We expect to continue to have access to the capital resources  necessary to
expand and develop our business.  Future development and acquisition  activities
will be undertaken as suitable  opportunities  arise. We do not expect to pursue
these  activities  unless adequate sources of financing are available and we can
achieve satisfactory returns on our investments.

     An annual capital expenditures budget is prepared for each property that is
intended  to provide  for all  necessary  recurring  and  non-recurring  capital
expenditures.  We believe that  property  operating  cash flows,  which  include
reimbursements  from tenants for certain  expenses,  will provide the  necessary
funding for these expenditures.

</TABLE>

     There  are  construction  loans in place  for the costs of the new mall and
open-air center developments. The costs of the remaining projects will be funded
with operating cash flows and the credit facilities.

     We have entered into a number of option  agreements for the  development of
future regional malls and community  centers.  Except for the projects listed in
the above table, we do not have any other material capital commitments.

Acquisitions

     We acquired  eight malls,  two  associated  centers and a community  center
during  2004 for an  aggregate  purchase  price  of  $950.0  million,  including
transaction  costs.  We paid $587.2  million in cash,  assumed $304.6 million of
debt,  agreed to pay $12.0 million for land at a future date and issued  limited
partnership  interests in our Operating  Partnership  valued at $46.2 million to
fund these  acquisitions.  The cash portions of the purchase  prices were funded
with  borrowings  under our credit  facilities  and the three new loans totaling
$272.6  million.   These  acquisitions  are  expected  to  generate  an  initial
weighted-average, unleveraged return of 7.68%.

Dispositions

     During 2004, we generated aggregate net proceeds of $113.6 million from the
Galileo  Transaction,  the sales of four  community  centers  and one  community
center expansion and the sales of nine outparcels. The net proceeds were used to
reduce  borrowings  under our credit  facilities.  In January  2005, we sold two
power centers,  one community center and a community center expansion to Galileo
America.  The net  proceeds  of $42.5  million  were used to reduce  outstanding
balances under our lines of credit.

Other Capital Expenditures

     Including our share of unconsolidated affiliates' capital expenditures,  we
spent $37.4  million in 2004 for tenant  allowances,  which  generate  increased
rents  from  tenants  over  the  terms  of their  leases.  Deferred  maintenance


                                       39
<PAGE>

expenditures  were  $17.5  million  for  2004  and  included  $6.0  million  for
resurfacing and improved lighting of parking lots, $5.1 million for roof repairs
and  replacements  and $6.4 million for various other  expenditures.  Renovation
expenditures were $21.1 million in 2004.

     Deferred  maintenance  expenditures  are billed to  tenants as common  area
maintenance  expense,  and  most  are  recovered  over a 5- to  15-year  period.
Renovation  expenditures  are primarily for remodeling and upgrades of malls, of
which approximately 30% is recovered from tenants over a 5- to 15-year period.

     We expect to renovate  two malls during 2005 at a total  estimated  cost of
$28.0 million,  which will be funded from operating cash flows and  availability
under our credit facilities. One of the renovation projects will be completed in
2005 and the other will be completed in 2006.


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Unconsolidated Affiliates

     We have  ownership  interests in nine  unconsolidated  affiliates  that are
described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The unconsolidated
affiliates  are  accounted  for using the equity  method of  accounting  and are
reflected in the consolidated  balance sheets as "Investments in  Unconsolidated
Affiliates." The following are circumstances  when we may consider entering into
a joint venture with a third party:

     |X|  Third  parties  may  approach  us with  opportunities  where they have
          obtained land and performed some pre-development  activities, but they
          may  not  have  sufficient  access  to the  capital  resources  or the
          development and leasing expertise to bring the project to fruition. We
          enter  into such  arrangements  when we  determine  such a project  is
          viable and we can achieve a satisfactory return on our investment.  We
          typically  earn  development  fees from the joint  venture and provide
          management  and leasing  services to the property once it is placed in
          operation.

     |X|  We determine  that we may have the  opportunity  to  capitalize on the
          value we have  created in a property  by  selling an  interest  in the
          property to a third party.  This provides us with an additional source
          of capital  that can be used to develop  or  acquire  additional  real
          estate  assets that we believe  will  provide  greater  potential  for
          growth.  When we retain an interest in an asset  rather than selling a
          100% interest,  it is typically  because this allows us to continue to
          manage the  property,  which  provides us the ability to earn fees for
          management,  leasing, development,  financing and acquisition services
          provided to the joint venture.

 Guarantees

     We have  guaranteed 100% of the debt to be incurred to develop the property
owned by Imperial  Valley Mall L.P. and 50% of the debt of Parkway Place L.P. We
have issued these guarantees  primarily  because it allows the joint ventures to
obtain funding at a lower cost than could be obtained otherwise. This results in
a higher return for the joint venture on its investment,  and in a higher return
on our  investment  in the joint  venture.  We may  receive a fee from the joint
venture  for  providing  the  guaranty.  Additionally,  when we are  required to
perform under a guaranty,  the terms of the guaranty  typically provide that the
joint venture partners' interests in the joint venture is assigned to us, to the
extent of our guaranty.

                                       40
<PAGE>

     We had  guaranteed  the debt incurred to develop the property owned by Mall
of South  Carolina L.P. and had received a fee for the  guaranty.  This debt was
refinanced  during 2004 by Mall of South  Carolina  L.P.  and, as a result,  the
guaranty was terminated. We recognized revenues of $0.5 million and $0.2 million
related to this guaranty during 2004 and 2003, respectively.

     The  Company's  guarantees  and  the  related  accounting  are  more  fully
described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.


Critical Accounting Policies

     Our  significant  accounting  policies  are  disclosed  in  Note  2 to  the
consolidated  financial statements.  The following discussion describes our most
critical  accounting  policies,  which are those that are both  important to the
presentation  of our  financial  condition  and results of  operations  and that
require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.

Revenue Recognition

     Minimum  rental   revenue  from   operating   leases  is  recognized  on  a
straight-line  basis  over the  initial  terms of the  related  leases.  Certain
tenants  are  required to pay  percentage  rent if their  sales  volumes  exceed
thresholds specified in their lease agreements. Percentage rent is recognized as
revenue when the thresholds are achieved and the amounts become determinable.

     We receive  reimbursements  from tenants for real estate taxes,  insurance,
common area maintenance, and other recoverable operating expenses as provided in
the lease  agreements.  Tenant  reimbursements  are recognized as revenue in the
period the  related  operating  expenses  are  incurred.  Tenant  reimbursements
related to certain capital  expenditures are billed to tenants over periods of 5
to 15 years and are recognized as revenue when billed.

     We receive management,  leasing and development fees from third parties and
unconsolidated  affiliates.  Management  fees are  charged  as a  percentage  of
revenues (as defined in the management  agreement) and are recognized as revenue
when earned. Development fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over
the development  period.  Leasing fees are charged for newly executed leases and
lease  renewals  and are  recognized  as revenue when  earned.  Development  and
leasing fees  received from  unconsolidated  affiliates  during the  development
period are  recognized  as revenue  to the extent of the  third-party  partners'
ownership interest. Fees to the extent of our ownership interest are recorded as
a reduction to our investment in the unconsolidated affiliate.

     Gains on sales of real estate assets are  recognized  when it is determined
that  the  sale  has  been  consummated,  the  buyer's  initial  and  continuing
investment  is  adequate,  our  receivable,  if any,  is not  subject  to future
subordination,  and the  buyer  has  assumed  the usual  risks  and  rewards  of
ownership of the asset. When we have an ownership interest in the buyer, gain is
recognized to the extent of the third party partner's ownership interest and the
portion of the gain attributable to our ownership interest is deferred.

Real Estate Assets

     We  capitalize  predevelopment  project  costs paid to third  parties.  All
previously  capitalized  predevelopment  costs are expensed when it is no longer
probable  that the project  will be  completed.  Once  development  of a project
commences,  all direct  costs  incurred  to  construct  the  project,  including
interest and real estate taxes, are capitalized.  Additionally,  certain general
and administrative  expenses are allocated to the projects and capitalized based
on the amount of time  applicable  personnel  work on the  development  project.
Ordinary  repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Major  replacements
and  improvements  are capitalized and depreciated  over their estimated  useful
lives.

                                       41
<PAGE>

     All acquired real estate assets are accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting  and  accordingly,  the results of operations  are included in the
consolidated  statements of operations from the respective dates of acquisition.
The purchase  price is allocated to (i)  tangible  assets,  consisting  of land,
buildings  and  improvements,  and  tenant  improvements  and (ii)  identifiable
intangible  assets generally  consisting of above- and  below-market  leases and
in-place  leases.  We use estimates of fair value based on estimated cash flows,
using  appropriate  discount rates, and other valuation  methods to allocate the
purchase  price to the acquired  tangible  and  intangible  assets.  Liabilities
assumed  generally  consist of mortgage debt on the real estate assets acquired.
Assumed debt with a stated  interest rate that is  significantly  different from
market  interest  rates is recorded at its fair value based on estimated  market
interest rates at the date of acquisition.

     Depreciation is computed on a  straight-line  basis over estimated lives of
40 years for  buildings,  10 to 20 years for  certain  improvements  and 7 to 10
years for  equipment and  fixtures.  Tenant  improvements  are  capitalized  and
depreciated  on a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term of the  related  lease.
Lease-related  intangibles from acquisitions of real estate assets are amortized
over the remaining terms of the related leases.  The  amortization of above- and
below-market  leases is recorded as an  adjustment  to minimum  rental  revenue,
while the  amortization  of all other  lease-related  intangibles is recorded as
amortization  expense. Any difference between the face value of the debt assumed
and its fair value is amortized to interest  expense over the remaining  term of
the debt using the effective interest method.

Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets

     We periodically  evaluate  long-lived assets to determine if there has been
any  impairment in their  carrying  values and record  impairment  losses if the
undiscounted  cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than
the assets' carrying amounts or if there are other indicators of impairment.  If
it is  determined  that an impairment  has  occurred,  the excess of the asset's
carrying  value over its  estimated  fair value is  charged  to  operations.  We
recorded losses on the impairment of real estate assets of $3,080 in 2004, which
are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.  There were no
impairment charges in 2003 and 2002.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     Effective   January  1,  2004,  we  adopted  the  provisions  of  Financial
Accounting   Standards   Board  ("FASB")   Interpretation   ("FIN")  No.  46(R),
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,  an interpretation of ARB No. 51."
The interpretation requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise
absorbs a majority of the entity's  expected losses,  receives a majority of the
entity's  expected  residual  returns,  or  both,  as  a  result  of  ownership,
contractual or other financial  interests in the entity.  We determined that one
unconsolidated  affiliate,  PPG  Venture I  Limited  Partnership  ("PPG"),  is a
variable  interest  entity  and that we are the  primary  beneficiary.  We began
consolidating the assets, liabilities and results of operations of PPG effective
January  1,  2004.   We   initially   measured  the  assets,   liabilities   and
noncontrolling  interest of PPG at the carrying amounts at which they would have
been carried in the consolidated  financial  statements as if FIN 46(R) had been
effective when we first met the conditions to be the primary beneficiary,  which
was  the  inception  of  PPG.  We own a 10%  interest  in PPG,  which  owns  one
associated center and two community centers.

     In May 2003, the FASB issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
("SFAS")  No.  150,   "Accounting  for  Certain   Financial   Instruments   with
Characteristics   of  Both   Liabilities   and  Equity,"  which  specifies  that
instruments within its scope are obligations of the issuer and,  therefore,  the
issuer must classify them as liabilities. Financial instruments within the scope
of the  pronouncement  include  mandatorily  redeemable  financial  instruments,
obligations to repurchase the issuer's equity shares by transferring assets, and
certain  obligations  to issue a  variable  number of  shares.  SFAS No.  150 is
effective for all financial  instruments  entered into or modified after May 31,
2003.  However,  on  October  29,  2003,  the  FASB  indefinitely  deferred  the
provisions  of  paragraphs  9 and 10 of SFAS No. 150  related to  noncontrolling
interests  in  limited-life   subsidiaries.   During  2004,  the  joint  venture
agreements with minority  interest  partners were amended so that they no longer
have a limited life.

                                       42

     In December 2004,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,  "Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets,  an amendment of APB No. 29,  Accounting for Nonmonetary  Transactions."
SFAS No. 153 requires exchanges of productive assets to be accounted for at fair
value, rather than at carryover basis, unless (1) neither the asset received nor
the asset  surrendered has a fair value that is determinable  within  reasonable
limits  or (2) the  transactions  lack  commercial  substance.  SFAS No.  153 is
effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges  occurring in fiscal periods beginning
after June 15, 2005.  We do not expect the  adoption of this  standard to have a
material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

     In December  2004, the FASB released its final revised  standard,  SFAS No.
123 (Revised  2004),  "Share-Based  Payment."  SFAS No.  123(R)  requires that a
public  entity  measure the cost of equity  based  service  awards  based on the
grant-date fair value of the award. That cost will be recognized over the period
during  which an employee is  required  to provide  service in exchange  for the
award or the vesting  period.  No  compensation  cost is  recognized  for equity
instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. Adoption of
SFAS No. 123(R) is required for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We
previously  adopted the fair value  provisions of SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting for
Stock  Based  Compensation",  as  amended  by  SFAS  No.  148,  "Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation  -  Transition  and  Disclosure - An Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123"  effective  January 1, 2003. We do not expect the adoption of
this standard to have a material effect on our financial  position or results of
operations.

Impact of Inflation

     In the last three years,  inflation has not had a significant impact on our
operations  because of the  relatively  low inflation  rate.  Substantially  all
tenant leases do, however,  contain  provisions  designed to protect us from the
impact of inflation.  These  provisions  include clauses  enabling us to receive
percentage  rent based on tenants'  gross  sales,  which  generally  increase as
prices rise, and/or escalation  clauses,  which generally  increase rental rates
during the terms of the leases. In addition, many of the leases are for terms of
less than 10 years  which may  provide us the  opportunity  to replace  existing
leases  with new leases at higher base  and/or  percentage  rent if rents of the
existing  leases are below the then  existing  market  rate.  Most of the leases
require the tenants to pay their share of operating  expenses,  including common
area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, which reduces our exposure to
increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.

Funds From Operations

     Funds From  Operations  ("FFO") is a widely used  measure of the  operating
performance of real estate companies that  supplements net income  determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  The National
Association  of Real  Estate  Investment  Trusts  ("NAREIT")  defines FFO as net
income  (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses on sales of
operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization,  and after adjustments
for   unconsolidated   partnerships   and  joint   ventures.   Adjustments   for
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated on the same basis.
We compute FFO as defined above by NAREIT less dividends on preferred stock. Our
method of calculating FFO may be different from methods used by other REITs and,
accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.

     We believe  that FFO  provides an  additional  indicator  of the  operating
performance of our properties without giving effect to real estate  depreciation
and  amortization,  which  assumes  the  value of real  estate  assets  declines
predictably over time. Since values of  well-maintained  real estate assets have
historically  risen  with  market  conditions,  we  believe  that  FFO  enhances
investors'  understanding  of our  operating  performance.  The use of FFO as an
indicator of financial  performance  is influenced not only by the operations of
our properties and interest rates, but also by our capital structure.

     FFO does not represent cash flows from  operations as defined by accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States,  is  not  necessarily
indicative  of cash  available  to fund all cash flow  needs and  should  not be
considered  as an  alternative  to net income for  purposes  of  evaluating  our
operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.

                                       43
<PAGE>

      FFO increased 14.3% in 2004 to $310.4 million compared to $271.6 million
in 2003. The New 2004 Properties generated 69% of the growth in FFO.
Consistently high portfolio occupancy, increases in rental rates from new and
renewal leasing and increased recoveries of operating expenses primarily
accounted for the remaining 31% growth in FFO.

      The calculation of FFO is as follows (in thousands):

ITEM 7A.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     We are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and derivative
financial  instruments.  We have used derivative financial instruments to manage
exposure  to changes in interest  rates and not for  speculative  purposes.  Our
interest rate risk management policy requires that we use derivative instruments
for  hedging  purposes  only and that  they be  entered  into  only  with  major
financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors.

     Based  on  our  proportionate  share  of  consolidated  and  unconsolidated
variable-rate debt at December 31, 2004, a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest
rates on variable  rate debt would  increase  or  decrease  annual cash flows by
approximately $3.8 million and, after the effect of capitalized interest, annual
earnings by approximately $3.7 million.

     Based on our proportionate  share of total  consolidated and unconsolidated
debt at December 31, 2004, a 0.5% increase in interest  rates would decrease the
fair value of debt by  approximately  $64.3  million,  while a 0.5%  decrease in
interest  rates would  increase  the fair value of debt by  approximately  $66.3
million.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

     As of the end of the period  covered by this annual  report,  an evaluation
was performed  under the  supervision of our Chief  Executive  Officer and Chief
Financial  Officer  and  with  the  participation  of  our  management,  of  the
effectiveness  of the  design  and  operation  of our  disclosure  controls  and
procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the
Chief  Executive   Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that  our
disclosure  controls and  procedures  are  effective.  No change in our internal
control over financial  reporting  occurred  during the fourth fiscal quarter of
the  period  covered by this  annual  report  that  materially  affected,  or is
reasonably  likely to materially  affect,  our internal  control over  financial
reporting.

Report Of Management On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

     Management  of CBL &  Associates  Properties,  Inc.  and  its  consolidated
subsidiaries  (the  "Company"),  is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate  internal  control over  financial  reporting.  The Company's  internal
control over financial  reporting is a process designed under the supervision of
the Company's  chief executive  officer and chief  financial  officer to provide
reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the
preparation  of  the  Company's  financial  statements  for  external  reporting
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

     As of  December  31,  2004,  management  conducted  an  assessment  of  the
effectiveness of the Company's  internal control over financial  reporting based
on the framework  established in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based
on this  assessment,  management  has  determined  that the  Company's  internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 is effective.

     The Company's  internal control over financial  reporting includes policies
and  procedures  that pertain to the  maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail,  accurately and fairly reflect  transactions and dispositions of assets;
provide  reasonable  assurances that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to
permit  preparation of financial  statements in accordance  with U.S.  generally
accepted  accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures are being
made only in accordance with  authorizations  of management and the directors of
the Company;  and provide reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely
detection of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use or  disposition  of the  Company's
assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.

     Management's  assessment of the  effectiveness  of the  Company's  internal
control  over  financial  reporting  as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm, as
stated in their report appearing herein,  which expresses an unqualified opinion
on  management's  assessment  of the  effectiveness  of the  Company's  internal
control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company's  internal  control over financial  reporting as of December 31,
2004.

Associates   Properties,   Inc.  and  subsidiaries  (the  "Company")  maintained
effective  internal  control over  financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal  Control--Integrated  Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations  of the Treadway  Commission.  The
Company's  management is responsible for maintaining  effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's  assessment  and an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

     We  conducted  our audit in  accordance  with the  standards  of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and  perform  the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether
effective  internal  control over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all
material  respects.  Our audit included  obtaining an  understanding of internal
control over financial reporting,  evaluating management's  assessment,  testing
and evaluating the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control,  and
performing   such  other   procedures   as  we   considered   necessary  in  the
circumstances.  We believe that our audit  provides a  reasonable  basis for our
opinions.

     A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
company's  board of  directors,  management,  and  other  personnel  to  provide
reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the
preparation  of financial  statements for external  purposes in accordance  with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A company's  internal control over
financial  reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the  maintenance  of records that, in reasonable  detail,  accurately and fairly
reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of the assets of the company;  (2)
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use, or  disposition  of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

     Because of the inherent  limitations  of internal  control  over  financial
reporting,  including  the  possibility  of  collusion  or  improper  management
override of controls,  material  misstatements  due to error or fraud may not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also,  projections of any evaluation of
the  effectiveness  of the internal  control over financial  reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate  because
of changes in conditions,  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

     In  our  opinion,  management's  assessment  that  the  Company  maintained
effective internal control over financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004, is
fairly stated, in all material  respects,  based on the criteria  established in
Internal  Control--Integrated  Framework  issued by the  Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations  of the  Treadway  Commission.  Also in our  opinion,  the Company
maintained, in all material respects,  effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control--Integrated   Framework   issued   by  the   Committee   of   Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
CBL & Associates Properties, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CBL & Associates
Properties,  Inc. and  subsidiaries  (the "Company") as of December 31, 2004 and
2003,  and the related  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  shareholders'
equity,  and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial  statement  schedules listed in
the  Index  at Item 15.  These  financial  statements  and  financial  statement
schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the financial  statements  and  financial  statement
schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of CBL and Associates Properties, Inc.
and  subsidiaries  as of December  31,  2004 and 2003,  and the results of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the United States of America.  Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedules,  when  considered  in  relation to the basic  consolidated  financial
statements  taken as a whole,  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the
information set forth therein.

We have also  audited,  in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting  Oversight Board (United States),  the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the
criteria  established in Internal  Control--Integrated  Framework  issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated March 16, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management's assessment
of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial  reporting
and an  unqualified  opinion  on the  effectiveness  of the  Company's  internal
control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in thousands, except share data)

NOTE 1.  ORGANIZATION

     CBL & Associates  Properties,  Inc. ("CBL"), a Delaware  corporation,  is a
self-managed,  self-administered,  fully integrated real estate investment trust
("REIT") that is engaged in the ownership,  development,  acquisition,  leasing,
management  and  operation of regional  shopping  malls and  community  shopping
centers. CBL's shopping center properties are located primarily in the Southeast
and Midwest, as well as in select markets in other regions of the United States.

     CBL conducts  substantially  all of its  business  through CBL & Associates
Limited Partnership (the "Operating  Partnership).  As of December 31, 2004, the
Operating  Partnership  owned  controlling  interests in 64 regional  malls,  25
associated  centers (each  located  adjacent to a regional  mall),  12 community
centers  and  CBL's  corporate  office  building.   The  Operating   Partnership
consolidates  the  financial  statements  of  all  entities  in  which  it has a
controlling financial interest.  The Operating Partnership owned non-controlling
interests  in five  regional  malls,  one  associated  center  and 48  community
centers. Because major decisions such as the acquisition, sale or refinancing of
principal partnership or joint venture assets must be approved by one or more of
the  other  partners,   the  Operating   Partnership   does  not  control  these
partnerships and joint ventures and, accordingly, accounts for these investments
using the equity method. The Operating  Partnership had one mall, which is owned
in a joint venture,  two mall  expansions,  one open-air  shopping  center,  two
associated  centers,  one of which is owned in a joint  venture,  one associated
center  expansion,  one  associated  center  redevelopment  and three  community
centers under construction at December 31, 2004. The Operating  Partnership also
holds options to acquire certain development properties owned by third parties.

     CBL is the 100% owner of two qualified REIT  subsidiaries,  CBL Holdings I,
Inc. and CBL Holdings II, Inc. At December 31, 2004,  CBL Holdings I, Inc.,  the
sole  general  partner  of the  Operating  Partnership,  owned  a  1.6%  general
partnership  interest in the  Operating  Partnership  and CBL  Holdings II, Inc.
owned a 53.4% limited  partnership  interest for a combined interest held by CBL
of 55.0%.

     The minority interest in the Operating Partnership is held primarily by CBL
& Associates,  Inc. and its affiliates (collectively "CBL's Predecessor") and by
affiliates of The Richard E. Jacobs Group,  Inc.  ("Jacobs").  CBL's Predecessor
contributed their interests in certain real estate properties and joint ventures
to the Operating Partnership in exchange for a limited partnership interest when
the Operating  Partnership was formed in November 1993. Jacobs contributed their
interests in certain real estate  properties and joint ventures to the Operating
Partnership  in exchange for a limited  partnership  interest when the Operating
Partnership  acquired the  majority of Jacobs'  interests  in 23  properties  in
January 2001 and the balance of such interests in February 2002. At December 31,
2004, CBL's Predecessor owned a 15.4% limited partnership interest, Jacobs owned
a 20.9%  limited  partnership  interest and third  parties owned an 8.7% limited
partnership interest in the Operating Partnership.  CBL's Predecessor also owned
2.7 million  shares of CBL's common  stock at December 31, 2004,  for a combined
total interest of 20.0% in the Operating Partnership.

     The  Operating   Partnership   conducts  CBL's   property   management  and
development   activities  through  CBL  &  Associates   Management,   Inc.  (the
"Management  Company")  to comply  with  certain  requirements  of the  Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  During March 2004, the Operating
Partnership  acquired the 94% of the Management  Company's common stock that was
owned by individuals who are directors and/or officers of CBL,  resulting in the
Operating  Partnership owning 100% of the Management Company's common stock. The
Operating  Partnership paid $75 for the 94% of common stock acquired,  which was
equal to the initial  capital  contribution  of the  individuals  that owned the
interest.  The  Operating  Partnership  continues to own 100% of the  Management
Company's preferred stock. As a result, the Operating  Partnership  continues to
consolidate the Management Company.

     CBL, the Operating  Partnership and the Management Company are collectively
referred to herein as "the Company." All significant  intercompany  balances and
transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated presentation.

NOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Real Estate Assets

     The Company capitalizes predevelopment project costs paid to third parties.
All  previously  capitalized  predevelopment  costs are  expensed  when it is no
longer  probable  that the project  will be  completed.  Once  development  of a
project commences, all direct costs incurred to construct the project, including
interest and real estate taxes, are capitalized.  Additionally,  certain general
and administrative  expenses are allocated to the projects and capitalized based
on the amount of time  applicable  personnel  work on the  development  project.
Ordinary  repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Major  replacements
and  improvements  are capitalized and depreciated  over their estimated  useful
lives.

     All acquired real estate assets have been  accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting and accordingly,  the results of operations are included in
the  consolidated   statements  of  operations  from  the  respective  dates  of
acquisition.  The Company  allocates the purchase price to (i) tangible  assets,
consisting of land,  buildings and improvements,  and tenant  improvements,  and
(ii)  identifiable  intangible  assets,   generally  consisting  of  above-  and
below-market  leases and in-place leases,  which are included in other assets in
the  consolidated  balance sheet. The Company uses estimates of fair value based
on estimated cash flows,  using appropriate  discount rates, and other valuation
techniques  to  allocate  the  purchase  price  to  the  acquired  tangible  and
intangible assets. Liabilities assumed generally consist of mortgage debt on the
real estate assets  acquired.  Assumed debt with a stated  interest rate that is
significantly  different from market interest rates for similar debt instruments
is recorded at its fair value based on estimated  market  interest  rates at the
date of acquisition.

     Depreciation is computed on a  straight-line  basis over estimated lives of
40 years for  buildings,  10 to 20 years for  certain  improvements  and 7 to 10
years for  equipment and  fixtures.  Tenant  improvements  are  capitalized  and
depreciated  on a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term of the  related  lease.
Lease-related  intangibles from acquisitions of real estate assets are amortized
over the remaining terms of the related leases.  The  amortization of above- and
below-market  leases is recorded as an  adjustment  to minimum  rental  revenue,
while the  amortization  of all other  lease-related  intangibles is recorded as
amortization  expense. Any difference between the face value of the debt assumed
and its fair value is amortized to interest  expense over the remaining  term of
the debt using the effective interest method.

     The Company's acquired intangibles and their balance sheet  classifications
as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, are summarized as follows:

2007, $3,030 in 2008 and $2,371 in 2009.

     Total interest expense  capitalized was $4,517,  $5,974 and $5,109 in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets

     The Company  evaluates the carrying  value of long-lived  assets to be held
and used when  events or changes in  circumstances  warrant  such a review.  The
carrying value of a long-lived  asset is considered  impaired when its estimated
future  undiscounted  cash  flows are less  than its  carrying  value.  If it is
determined that an impairment has occurred,  the excess of the asset's  carrying
value over its estimated fair value is charged to operations.

     During  2004,  the  Company  recognized  a loss of $114 on the  sale of one
community center as a loss on impairment of real estate assets.

     During 2004,  the Company  determined  that the carrying  value of a vacant
community center exceeded the community  center's  estimated fair value by $402.
The Company  recorded the  reduction  in the carrying  value of the related real
estate  assets to their  estimated  fair value as a loss on  impairment  of real
estate assets.

     Subsequent to December 31, 2004,  the Company  completed the third phase of
the Galileo America joint venture  transaction  discussed in Note 5. The Company
recognized a loss of $1,947 on this  transaction as an impairment of real estate
assets in 2004 and reduced the carrying value of the related  assets,  which are
classified  as real estate  assets held for sale as of December  31, 2004 in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

     Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the Company reached a tentative  agreement
to sell five of its community centers.  As a result, the Company recorded a loss
on  impairment  of real  estate  assets of $617 in 2004 to reduce  the  carrying
values of the five community  centers to their respective  estimated fair values
based on the  expected  selling  price.  Since the Company  determined  that the
properties  were held for sale  subsequent to December 31, 2004, the real estate
assets related to these five community centers are reflected as held and used in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

     There were no impairment charges in 2003 and 2002.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

     The  Company   considers  all  highly  liquid   investments  with  original
maturities of three months or less as cash equivalents.

Deferred Financing Costs

     Net deferred  financing costs of $13,509 and $10,808 were included in other
assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003,  respectively.  Deferred  financing  costs
include  fees and  costs  incurred  to obtain  financing  and are  amortized  to
interest  expense  over the terms of the  related  notes  payable.  Amortization
expense was $4,390,  $3,268,  and $4,114 in 2004,  2003 and 2002,  respectively.
Accumulated amortization was $7,815 and $5,030 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Revenue Recognition

     Minimum  rental   revenue  from   operating   leases  is  recognized  on  a
straight-line  basis  over the  initial  terms of the  related  leases.  Certain
tenants  are  required to pay  percentage  rent if their  sales  volumes  exceed
thresholds specified in their lease agreements. Percentage rent is recognized as
revenue when the thresholds are achieved and the amounts become determinable.

     The Company  receives  reimbursements  from tenants for real estate  taxes,
insurance, common area maintenance,  and other recoverable operating expenses as
provided  in the lease  agreements.  Tenant  reimbursements  are  recognized  as
revenue  in the period the  related  operating  expenses  are  incurred.  Tenant
reimbursements  related to certain  capital  expenditures  are billed to tenants
over periods of 5 to 15 years and are recognized as revenue when billed.

                                       64
<PAGE>

     The Company  receives  management,  leasing and development fees from third
parties  and  unconsolidated  affiliates.  Management  fees  are  charged  as  a
percentage  of  revenues  (as  defined  in the  management  agreement)  and  are
recognized as revenue when earned. Development fees are recognized as revenue on
a pro rata basis over the development period. Leasing fees are charged for newly
executed  leases and lease  renewals and are  recognized as revenue when earned.
Development and leasing fees received from unconsolidated  affiliates during the
development  period  are  recognized  as  revenue  only  to  the  extent  of the
third-party  partners' ownership  interest.  Development and leasing fees during
the  development  period to the extent of the Company's  ownership  interest are
recorded  as a  reduction  to the  Company's  investment  in the  unconsolidated
affiliate.

Gain on Sales of Real Estate Assets

     Gains on sales of real estate assets are  recognized  when it is determined
that  the  sale  has  been  consummated,  the  buyer's  initial  and  continuing
investment  is adequate,  the  Company's  receivable,  if any, is not subject to
future  subordination,  and the buyer has assumed the usual risks and rewards of
ownership of the asset. When the Company has an ownership interest in the buyer,
gain is recognized to the extent of the third party partner's ownership interest
and the portion of the gain attributable to the Company's  ownership interest is
deferred.

Income Taxes

     The Company is qualified  as a REIT under the  provisions  of the Code.  To
maintain qualification as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least
90% of its taxable income to shareholders and meet certain other requirements.

     As a REIT, the Company is generally not liable for federal corporate income
taxes.  If the  Company  fails to qualify  as a REIT in any  taxable  year,  the
Company will be subject to federal and state income taxes on its taxable  income
at regular  corporate tax rates. Even if the Company maintains its qualification
as a REIT,  the Company  may be subject to certain  state and local taxes on its
income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed
income. State income taxes were not material in 2004, 2003 and 2002.

     The Company has also elected taxable REIT subsidiary status for some of its
subsidiaries.  This enables the Company to receive  income and provide  services
that would otherwise be impermissible  for REITs.  For these entities,  deferred
tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the
financial  reporting  basis and the tax basis of assets and  liabilities  at the
enacted  tax rates  expected  to be in  effect  when the  temporary  differences
reverse.  A  valuation  allowance  for  deferred  tax assets is  provided if the
Company  believes  all or some  portion  of the  deferred  tax  asset may not be
realized.  An increase or decrease in the valuation  allowance that results from
the  change in  circumstances  that  causes a change in our  judgment  about the
realizability  of the related  deferred  tax asset is  included  in income.  The
Company had a net  deferred tax asset of $16,636 and $8,018 at December 31, 2004
and  2003,  respectively,  which  consisted  primarily  of  net  operating  loss
carryforwards,  that was  reduced to zero by a  valuation  allowance  because of
uncertainty  about the realization of the net deferred tax asset considering all
available evidence.

Derivative Financial Instruments

     The Company records derivative financial  instruments as either an asset or
liability  measured at the instrument's  fair value. Any fair value  adjustments
affect  either  shareholders'  equity or net income  depending  on  whether  the
derivative  instrument  qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so,
the nature of the hedging activity. See Note 15 for more information.

Concentration of Credit Risk

     The  Company's  tenants  include  national,  regional and local  retailers.
Financial  instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk


                                       64
<PAGE>

consist primarily of tenant  receivables.  The Company generally does not obtain
collateral or other security to support financial  instruments subject to credit
risk, but monitors the credit standing of tenants.

     The Company derives a substantial portion of its rental income from various
national and regional retail companies;  however,  no single tenant collectively
accounted for more than 10.0% of the Company's  total revenues in 2004, 2003 and
2002.

Earnings Per Share

     Basic  earnings  per share  ("EPS")  is  computed  by  dividing  net income
available to common  shareholders by the weighted average number of unrestricted
common shares  outstanding  for the period.  Diluted EPS assumes the issuance of
common stock for all potential dilutive common shares  outstanding.  The limited
partners' rights to convert their minority interest in the Operating Partnership
into shares of common stock are not dilutive (Note 9). The following  summarizes
the  impact of  potential  dilutive  common  shares on the  denominator  used to
compute earnings per share:

Stock-Based Compensation

     Historically, the Company accounted for its stock-based compensation plans,
which are described in Note 19, under the recognition and measurement principles
of Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25 "Accounting  for Stock Issued to
Employees"  ("APB No. 25") and  related  interpretations.  Effective  January 1,
2003, the Company elected to begin  recording the expense  associated with stock
options granted after January 1, 2003, on a prospective basis in accordance with
the fair value and transition  provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock
Based  Compensation",  as amended by SFAS No. 148,  "Accounting  for Stock-Based
Compensation  - Transition  and  Disclosure - An Amendment of FASB Statement No.
123." There were no stock options  granted  during the years ended  December 31,
2004 and 2003.

     No stock-based  compensation expense related to stock options granted prior
to January 1, 2003, has been  reflected in net income since all options  granted
had an exercise  price equal to the fair value of the Company's  common stock on
the date of grant. Therefore,  stock-based  compensation expense included in net
income available to common shareholders in 2004, 2003 and 2002 is less than that
which would have been  recognized  if the fair value  method had been applied to
all  stock-based  awards since the effective date of SFAS No. 123. The following
table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company
had  applied  the fair  value  recognition  provisions  of SFAS  No.  123 to all
outstanding and unvested awards in each period:

     The per share weighted  average fair value of stock options  granted during
2002 was $3.50.

Comprehensive Income

     Comprehensive  income includes all changes in  shareholders'  equity during
the  period,  except  those  resulting  from  investments  by  shareholders  and
distributions to shareholders.

Use of Estimates

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in conformity  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and  liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial  statements,  and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses  during the reported  period.  Actual  results  could differ from those
estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     Effective  January 1, 2004, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial
Accounting   Standards   Board  ("FASB")   Interpretation   No.  ("FIN")  46(R),
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,  an interpretation of ARB No. 51."
The interpretation requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise
absorbs a majority of the entity's  expected losses,  receives a majority of the
entity's  expected  residual  returns,  or  both,  as  a  result  of  ownership,
contractual or other  financial  interests in the entity.  Previously,  entities
were generally consolidated by an enterprise when it had a controlling financial
interest  through  ownership of a majority  voting  interest in the entity.  The
Company  determined  that one  unconsolidated  affiliate,  PPG Venture I Limited
Partnership  ("PPG"),  is a variable interest entity and that the Company is the
primary beneficiary. The Company began consolidating the assets, liabilities and
results of operations of PPG effective  January 1, 2004.  The Company  initially
measured  the  assets,  liabilities  and  noncontrolling  interest of PPG at the
carrying  amounts  at which they  would  have been  carried in the  consolidated
financial  statements as if FIN 46(R) had been  effective when the Company first
met the  conditions  to be the primary  beneficiary,  which was the inception of
PPG. The Company owns a 10% interest in PPG,  which owns one  associated  center
and  two  community  centers.  At  December  31,  2004,  PPG  had  non-recourse,
fixed-rate  debt of $37,795 that was secured by the real estate  assets it owns,
which had a net carrying value of $50,265.

     In May 2003, the FASB issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
("SFAS")  No.  150,   "Accounting  for  Certain   Financial   Instruments   with
Characteristics   of  Both   Liabilities   and  Equity,"  which  specifies  that
instruments within its scope are obligations of the issuer and,  therefore,  the
issuer must classify them as liabilities. Financial instruments within the scope
of the  pronouncement  include  mandatorily  redeemable  financial  instruments,
obligations to repurchase the issuer's equity shares by transferring assets, and
certain  obligations  to issue a  variable  number of  shares.  SFAS No.  150 is
effective for all financial  instruments  entered into or modified after May 31,
2003.  However,  on  October  29,  2003,  the  FASB  indefinitely  deferred  the
provisions  of  paragraphs  9 and 10 of SFAS No. 150  related to  noncontrolling
interests  in  limited-life   subsidiaries.   During  2004,  the  joint  venture
agreements with minority  interest  partners were amended so that they no longer
have a limited life.

                                       66
<PAGE>

     In December 2004,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,  "Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets,  an amendment of APB No. 29,  Accounting for Nonmonetary  Transactions."
SFAS No. 153 requires exchanges of productive assets to be accounted for at fair
value, rather than at carryover basis, unless (1) neither the asset received nor
the asset  surrendered has a fair value that is determinable  within  reasonable
limits  or (2) the  transactions  lack  commercial  substance.  SFAS No.  153 is
effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges  occurring in fiscal periods beginning
after June 15, 2005.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this  standard
to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.

     In December  2004, the FASB released its final revised  standard,  SFAS No.
123 (Revised  2004),  "Share-Based  Payment."  SFAS No.  123(R)  requires that a
public  entity  measure the cost of equity  based  service  awards  based on the
grant-date fair value of the award. That cost will be recognized over the period
during  which an employee is  required  to provide  service in exchange  for the
award or the vesting  period.  No  compensation  cost is  recognized  for equity
instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. Adoption of
SFAS No. 123(R) is required for fiscal  periods  beginning  after June 15, 2005.
The  Company  previously  adopted  the fair value  provisions  of SFAS No.  123,
"Accounting  for  Stock  Based  Compensation",  as  amended  by  SFAS  No.  148,
"Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation  -  Transition  and  Disclosure - An
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123" effective January 1, 2003. The Company does
not expect  the  adoption  of this  standard  to have a  material  effect on its
financial position or results of operations.

Reclassifications

     Certain amounts in the 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements have
been  reclassified  to  discontinued  operations  (see Note 4) to conform to the
current year presentation.

NOTE 3.  ACQUISITIONS

     The Company  includes  the  results of  operations  of real  estate  assets
acquired  in the  consolidated  statement  of  operations  from  the date of the
related acquisition.

2004 Acquisitions

     On March 12, 2004, the Company acquired Honey Creek Mall in Terre Haute, IN
for a purchase price,  including transaction costs, of $83,114,  which consisted
of $50,114 in cash and the assumption of $33,000 of non-recourse debt that bears
interest at a stated rate of 6.95% and matures in May 2009. The Company recorded
a debt premium of $3,146,  computed using an estimated  market  interest rate of
4.75%,  since the debt assumed was at an above-market  interest rate compared to
similar debt instruments at the date of acquisition.

interest  at a stated  rate of 6.70% and  matures  in March  2009.  The  Company
recorded a debt premium of $4,615,  computed using an estimated  market interest
rate of 4.75%,  since the debt  assumed  was at an  above-market  interest  rate
compared to similar debt instruments at the date of acquisition.

     On April 8, 2004, the Company  acquired  Greenbrier Mall in Chesapeake,  VA
for a cash  purchase  price,  including  transaction  costs,  of  $107,450.  The
purchase  price was partially  financed with a new recourse term loan of $92,650
that bears  interest at LIBOR plus 100 basis  points,  matures in April 2006 and
has three one-year extension options that are at the Company's election.

center, Chapel Hill Suburban, in Akron, OH for a cash purchase price,  including
transaction costs, of $78,252.  The purchase price was partially financed with a
new recourse  term loan of $66,500  that bears  interest at LIBOR plus 100 basis
points, matures in May 2006 and has three one-year extension options that are at
the Company's election.

     On June 22, 2004,  the Company  acquired Park Plaza Mall in Little Rock, AR
for a purchase price,  including transaction costs, of $77,526,  which consisted

     Initial  investments  in joint  ventures  that are in economic  substance a
capital contribution to the joint venture are recorded in an amount equal to the
Company's  historical  carryover basis in the real estate  contributed.  Initial
investments  in joint  ventures  that are in  economic  substance  the sale of a
portion of the  Company's  interest  in the real estate are  accounted  for as a
contribution  of real  estate  recorded  in an  amount  equal  to the  Company's
historical carryover basis in the ownership percentage retained and as a sale of
real estate with profit  recognized to the extent of the other joint  venturers'
interests in the joint venture.  Profit  recognition  assumes the Company has no
commitment  to reinvest  with respect to the  percentage of the real estate sold
and the accounting requirements of the full accrual method under SFAS No. 66 are
met. In general,  contributions  and  distributions of capital or cash flows and
allocations  of income and expense are made on a pro rata basis in proportion to
the equity interest held by each general or limited  partner.  All debt on these
properties  is  non-recourse.  See Note 17 for a description  of guarantees  the
Company has issued related to certain unconsolidated affiliates.

Galileo America Joint Venture

     On September 24, 2003,  the Company  formed  Galileo  America LLC ("Galileo
America"),  a joint venture with Galileo  America,  Inc., the U.S.  affiliate of
Australia-based  Galileo America Shopping Trust, to invest in community  centers
throughout the United States. The arrangement  provides for the Company to sell,
in three  phases,  its  interests in 51  community  centers for a total price of
$516,000 plus a 10% interest in Galileo America.

                                       72
<PAGE>

     The first phase of the  transaction  closed on October 23,  2003,  when the
Company  sold its  interests  in 41  community  centers to Galileo  America  for
$393,925, which consisted of $250,705 in cash, the retirement of $24,922 of debt
on one of the community centers, a note receivable of $4,813,  Galileo America's
assumption  of  $93,037  in debt and  $20,448  representing  the  Company's  10%
interest in Galileo  America.  The Company  used the net proceeds to fund escrow
amounts to be used in like-kind  exchanges and to reduce outstanding  borrowings
under the Company's credit facilities.  The Company recognized a gain of $71,886
from the first  phase and  recorded  its  investment  in Galileo  America at the
carryover basis of the real estate assets contributed for its 10% interest.  The
note receivable was paid subsequent to December 31, 2003.

     The second phase of the Galileo  America  transaction  closed on January 5,
2004,  when the Company sold its interest in six community  centers for $92,375,
which  consisted of $62,687 in cash, the retirement of $25,953 of debt on one of
the  community  centers,  the joint  venture's  assumption of $2,816 of debt and
closing costs of $919. The real estate assets and related mortgage notes payable
of the  properties  in the  second  phase were  reflected  as held for sale from
October 23, 2003, the date that it was determined  these assets met the criteria
to be reflected as held for sale. There was no depreciation  expense recorded on
these assets subsequent to October 23, 2003.

     The Company sold a community  center  expansion to Galileo  America  during
September 2004 for $3,447 in cash. The Company  recognized gain of $1,316 to the
extent  of  the  third  party  partner's  ownership  interest  and  recorded  an
investment of $147 in Galileo  America at the carryover basis of the real estate
assets contributed for its 10% interest.

     In October 2004, the Company sold its interests in one community  center to
Galileo  America for a purchase price of $17,900,  which  consisted of $2,900 in
cash, Galileo America's  assumption of $10,500 of debt and a limited partnership
interest in Galileo America,  Inc. The community center was originally scheduled
to be  included  in the third  phase of the  transaction  that closed in January
2005.  The Company  recognized a gain of $2,840 on the sale of this property and
recorded an  investment of $3,820 in Galileo  America at the carryover  basis of
the real estate assets contributed for its 10% interest in this property.

     The third phase of the  Galileo  America  transaction  closed on January 5,
2005,  when the Company sold its interest in two power  centers,  one  community
center and one  community  center  expansion  for  $58,600,  which  consisted of
$42,529 in cash,  the joint  venture's  assumption  of  $12,141 of debt,  $3,596
representing  the  Company's  interest in Galileo  America and closing  costs of
$334.  The  real  estate  assets  and  related  mortgage  notes  payable  of the
properties in the third phase were reflected as held for sale from January 2004,
the date that it was determined these assets met the criteria to be reflected as
held for sale. There was no depreciation expense recorded on these assets during
2004.

     The Company,  as tenant, has entered,  or will enter into,  separate master
lease agreements with Galileo America,  as landlord,  covering certain spaces in
certain of the properties sold or, to be sold, to the joint venture.  Under each
master  lease  agreement,  the Company is  obligated  to pay Galileo  America an
agreed-upon  minimum  annual  rent,  plus  a  pro  rata  share  of  common  area
maintenance expenses and real estate taxes, for each designated space for a term
of five years from the  applicable  property's  closing  date. If the Company is
able to lease a designated space to a third party,  then the amounts owed by the
Company under the master lease will be reduced by the amounts received under the
third party  lease.  If the amounts  under the third party lease are equal to or
greater  than the  Company's  obligation  for the full term of the master  lease
agreement,  then the Company's  obligation is zero.  When a third party lease is
executed that releases the Company from its obligation,  Galileo America assumes
the credit risk related to the third party lease.  This arrangement is in effect
until the end of the five-year term of the master lease.  Therefore,  if a third
party lease expires  before the  expiration  of the master lease term,  then the
Company  is  obligated  under  the  remaining  term  of the  master  lease.  Two
properties  in the first phase and one in the second phase are subject to master
lease  agreements.  The Company had a liability of $3,789 and $2,184 at December
31, 2004 and 2003,  respectively,  for the amounts to be paid over the remaining
terms of the master  lease  obligations.  The Company  reduces the  liability as
payments are made under the  obligations or as it is relieved of its obligations
under the terms of the master lease arrangements. The reduction in the liability
is  recognized  as gain to the  extent  that  the  Company  is  relieved  of its
obligation  under the master lease  arrangements by obtaining third party leases
that are sufficient to satisfy the related master lease obligation.  During 2004
and 2003,  the  Company  recognized  gain of $7,206 and $0,  respectively,  as a
result of being relieved of its obligation under the master lease arrangements.

                                       73

     The  Company  may  also  receive  up to  $8,000  of  additional  contingent
consideration  if, as the  exclusive  manager  of the  properties,  it  achieves
certain leasing  objectives  related to spaces that were vacant, or projected to
soon be vacant, at the time the first phase closed. The Company earned $4,167 in
2004 for  leasing  objectives  that were met during  2004,  of which  $3,750 was
recognized  as gain on sales of real estate  assets and $417,  representing  the
portion  attributable  to the Company's  ownership  interest,  was recorded as a
reduction of the Company's  investment in Galileo America.  In 2003, the Company
earned $3,833 for leasing  objectives  that were met as of December 31, 2003, of
which  $3,450 was  recognized  as gain on sales of real estate  assets and $383,
representing the portion  attributable to the Company's 10% ownership  interest,
was recorded as a reduction of the Company's investment in Galileo America.

     Pursuant to a long-term agreement, the Company is the exclusive manager for
all of the joint venture's properties in the United States, and will be entitled
to management, leasing, acquisition, disposition, asset management and financing
fees.

     In December 2004, Galileo America acquired interests in six properties from
a third party.  The Company  elected not to contribute its pro rata share of the
equity  contribution  necessary  to maintain a 10%  interest in Galileo  America
after the completion of this acquisition.  As a result, the Company's  ownership
interest in Galileo America was reduced to 7.2% as of December 31, 2004.

Other Unconsolidated Affiliates

     In February  2002, the Company  contributed  its interests in two community
centers and one associated center to PPG Venture I Limited Partnership,  a joint
venture with a third party, and retained a 10% interest. The total consideration
of $63,030 consisted of cash of $46,000 and the Company's retained interest.  As
discussed  in Note 2, the  Company  began to  consolidate  PPG Venture I Limited
Partnership effective January 1, 2004, as a result of the adoption of FIN 46(R).

     In March 2002,  the Company  acquired an additional 2% interest in Kentucky
Oaks Mall Company,  an  additional  17% interest in Madison Joint Venture and an
additional  31% interest in Columbia  Mall Company as discussed in Note 3. Since
the additional  interest in Columbia Mall Company resulted in the Company having
a 79%  controlling  interest in that joint  venture,  the  Company  discontinued
accounting for it using the equity method and began  consolidating  it as of the
date the additional 31% interest was acquired.

     During  2002,  the Company  entered  into three joint  ventures  with third
parties to develop two malls, Imperial Valley Mall and Coastal Grand.

     In  September  2004,  Mall of South  Carolina  L.P.  obtained a  long-term,
non-recourse,  fixed-rate mortgage loan totaling $118,000. The loan is comprised
of a $100,000  A-note to a financial  institution  that bears interest at 5.09%,
which  matures in September  2014,  and two 10-year  B-notes of $9,000 each that
bear interest at 7.75% and mature in September  2014.  The Company and its third
party partner in Mall of South  Carolina L.P. each hold one of the B-notes.  The
total net proceeds from these loans were used to retire  $80,493 of  outstanding
borrowings under the construction  loan that partially  financed the development
of Coastal Grand-Myrtle Beach.

     Non-recourse   and  recourse  loans  include  loans  that  are  secured  by
properties  owned by the Company that have a net carrying value of $4,130,922 at
December 31, 2004.  At December 31,  2004,  the Company had $950  available  and
unfunded under a recourse term loan commitment on one property.

Fixed-Rate Debt

     At December  31,  2004,  fixed-rate  loans bear  interest  at stated  rates
ranging  from 4.52% to 10.4%.  Outstanding  borrowings  under  fixed-rate  loans
include unamortized debt premiums of $39,837 that were recorded when the Company
assumed debt to acquire real estate assets that was at an above-market  interest
rate compared to similar debt instruments at the date of acquisition. Fixed-rate
loans generally  provide for monthly  payments of principal  and/or interest and
mature at various  dates from March 2006  through  April  2016,  with a weighted
average maturity of 5.6 years.

Variable-Rate Debt

     Recourse term loans bear interest at variable interest rates indexed to the
prime lending rate or London Interbank  Offered Rate ("LIBOR").  At December 31,
2004,  interest rates on recourse loans varied from 3.35% to 3.94%.  These loans
mature at various  dates from  January  2005 to December  2006,  with a weighted
average maturity of 1.3 years.

Unsecured Line of Credit

     In August 2004, the Company  entered into a new $400,000  unsecured  credit
facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 100 to 145 basis points
based on the  Company's  leverage,  as  defined  in the  agreement.  The  credit
facility matures in August 2006 and has three one-year extension options,  which

unsecured  credit  facility,  which had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.30% and
was scheduled to mature in September 2004. At December 31, 2004, the outstanding
borrowings of $39,900 under the $400,000 credit facility had a weighted  average
interest rate of 3.54%.

</TABLE>

     The secured lines of credit are secured by 21 of the Company's  properties,
which had an  aggregate  net  carrying  value of $475,831 at December  31, 2004.
Borrowings  under the secured  lines of credit had a weighted  average  interest
rate of 3.36% at December 31, 2004.

Letters of Credit

     At December 31, 2004,  the Company had  additional  secured lines of credit
with a total  commitment of $27,123 that can only be used for issuing letters of
credit.  The total  outstanding  under  these  lines of credit  was  $12,267  at
December 31, 2004.

Covenants and Restrictions

     The secured and unsecured line of credit  agreements  contain,  among other
restrictions,  certain financial  covenants including the maintenance of certain
financial coverage ratios,  minimum net worth  requirements,  and limitations on
cash flow distributions.  Additionally, certain property-specific mortgage notes
payable  require  the  maintenance  of debt  service  coverage  ratios  on their
respective  properties.  The Company was in  compliance  with all  covenants and
restrictions at December 31, 2004.

     Nineteen malls,  five  associated  centers,  two community  centers and the
office building are owned by special  purpose  entities that are included in the
Company's  consolidated  financial statements.  The sole business purpose of the
special purpose entities is to own and operate these  properties,  each of which
is encumbered by a  commercial-mortgage-backed-securities  loan. The real estate
and other assets owned by these special  purpose  entities are restricted  under
the loan  agreements in that they are not available to settle other debts of the
Company.  However,  so long as the loans are not under an event of  default,  as
defined in the loan  agreements,  the cash flows  from these  properties,  after
payments of debt service,  operating  expenses and  reserves,  are available for
distribution to the Company.

Debt Maturities

     As of December 31, 2004, the scheduled  principal  payments on all mortgage
and other notes payable,  including  construction loans and lines of credit, are

phase that closed in January 2005 (see Note 5). The Company intends to repay the
remaining loan of $387.

NOTE 9.  MINORITY INTERESTS

     Minority interests represent (i) the aggregate  partnership interest in the
Operating  Partnership  that is not owned by the Company and (ii) the  aggregate
ownership  interest in 13 of the Company's  shopping  center  properties that is
held by third parties.

Minority Interest in Operating Partnership

     The minority interest in the Operating Partnership is represented by common
units and special common units of limited partnership  interest in the Operating
Partnership (the "Operating Partnership Units") that the Company does not own.

     The  assets  and  liabilities  allocated  to  the  Operating  Partnership's
minority  interests  are based on their  ownership  percentage  of the Operating
Partnership  at  December  31,  2004  and  2003.  The  ownership  percentage  is
determined  by dividing  the number of Operating  Partnership  Units held by the
minority  interests  at  December  31,  2004  and  2003 by the  total  Operating
Partnership Units outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003,  respectively.  The
minority  interest  ownership  percentage  in  assets  and  liabilities  of  the
Operating  Partnership  was  45.0%  and  45.4% at  December  31,  2004 and 2003,
respectively.

     Income is allocated to the Operating Partnership's minority interests based
on their weighted average ownership during the year. The ownership percentage is
determined  by dividing the  weighted  average  number of Operating  Partnership
Units held by the minority  interests by the total  weighted  average  number of
Operating Partnership Units outstanding during the year.

     A change in the number of shares of common stock or  Operating  Partnership
Units  changes  the  percentage  ownership  of all  partners  of  the  Operating
Partnership.  An Operating  Partnership Unit is considered to be equivalent to a
share of common stock since it generally is redeemable for cash or shares of the
Company's common stock. As a result, an allocation is made between shareholders'
equity and minority  interest in the Operating  Partnership in the  accompanying
balance sheet to reflect the change in ownership of the Operating  Partnership's
underlying  equity  when  there is a  change  in the  number  of  shares  and/or
Operating Partnership Units outstanding.

                                       78
<PAGE>

     The total minority  interest in the Operating  Partnership was $554,629 and
$523,779 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.


Minority Interest in Operating Partnership-Conversion Rights

     Under  the  terms  of  the  Operating   Partnership's  limited  partnership
agreement,  each of the  limited  partners  has the right to  exchange  all or a
portion of its  partnership  interests  for shares of CBL's  common stock or, at
CBL's election, their cash equivalent.  When an exchange occurs, CBL assumes the
limited partner's ownership interests in the Operating  Partnership.  The number
of  shares of common  stock  received  by a  limited  partner  of the  Operating
Partnership  upon exercise of its exchange rights will be equal on a one-for-one
basis to the number of partnership  units exchanged by the limited partner.  The
amount of cash received by the limited partner,  if CBL elects to pay cash, will
be based on the five-day  trailing  average of the trading  price at the time of
exercise of the shares of common stock that would  otherwise  have been received
by the  limited  partner  in  the  exchange.  Neither  the  limited  partnership
interests in the Operating Partnership nor the shares of common stock of CBL are
subject to any right of mandatory redemption.

     As of January 31,  2004,  holders of  13,159,402  special  common units may
exchange  them for shares of common  stock or cash.  The  special  common  units
receive  a  minimum  distribution  of  $2.9025  per  unit  per  year.  When  the
distribution  on the common units exceeds $2.9025 per unit per year, the special
common units will receive a distribution equal to that paid on the common units.
The distribution on the common units exceeded $2.9025 per unit during 2004.

     In July 2004, the Company issued 780,470 special common units in connection
with the  acquisition of Monroeville  Mall,  which is discussed in Note 3. These
special common units receive a minimum distribution of $5.0765 per unit per year
for the first three years,  and a minimum  distribution  of $5.8575 per unit per
year thereafter.

     The  Operating  Partnership  issued  1,113,026  common  units  in  2002  in
connection  with  acquisitions  discussed  in Notes 3 and 5. The 118,695  common
units issued in connection  with the  acquisition of Panama City Mall,  which is
discussed in Note 3, receive a minimum annual  dividend of $3.375 per unit until
May 2012.  When the  distribution  on the common units exceeds  $3.375 per unit,
these common units will receive a distribution  equal to that paid on the common
units. Additionally,  if the annual distribution on the common units should ever
be less than $2.22 per unit, the $3.375 per unit dividend will be reduced by the
amount the per unit distribution is less than $2.22 per unit.

     During 2004,  holders  elected to exchange  31,196 special common units and
341,625 common units. The Company elected to exchange $5,949 of cash and 262,818
shares of common stock for these units.  The Company  purchased  460,083  common
units from a former  executive  of the  Company  who retired in 1997 for $21,013
during 2003. During 2002, third parties converted 446,652 common units to shares
of the Company's common stock.

     Outstanding   rights  to  convert  minority   interests  in  the  Operating
Partnership  to common stock were held by the following  parties at December 31,
2004 and 2003:

Minority Interest in Shopping Center Properties

     The  Company's   consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  assets,
liabilities and results of operations of 13 properties that the Company does not
wholly own. The minority interests in shopping center properties  represents the
aggregate  ownership  interest of third parties in these  properties.  The total
minority  interests  in  shopping  center  properties  was $11,977 and $3,652 at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

     The assets and liabilities  allocated to the minority interests in shopping
center properties are based on the third parties' ownership  percentages in each
shopping center  property at December 31, 2004 and 2003.  Income is allocated to
the minority interests in shopping center properties based on the third parties'
weighted average ownership in each shopping center property during the year.

NOTE 10.  MINIMUM RENTS

     Future   minimum   rents  do  not  include   percentage   rents  or  tenant
reimbursements that may become due.

NOTE 11.  MORTGAGE NOTES RECEIVABLE

     Mortgage  notes   receivable  are   collateralized   by  first   mortgages,
wrap-around  mortgages on the underlying real estate and related improvements or

NOTE 15.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to
changes  in  interest  rates.  The  Company  does not use  derivative  financial
instruments  for  speculative   purposes.   The  Company's  interest  rate  risk
management  policy  requires  that  derivative  instruments  be used for hedging
purposes  only  and  that  they  be  entered  into  only  with  major  financial
institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors.

     The Company's  objective in using  derivatives is to manage its exposure to
changes in interest rates. To accomplish this objective,  the Company  primarily
uses  interest  rate swap and cap  agreements  as part of its cash flow  hedging
strategy.

     At December 31, 2003,  the Company had one interest rate cap agreement that
was  already  in place on  $40,000  of  variable-rate  debt that was  assumed in
connection  with the  acquisition  of  Sunrise  Mall in 2003 (see  Note 3).  The
interest rate cap matured in May 2004. The interest rate cap's fair value was $0
at both the acquisition date and December 31, 2004.

     Interest rate swap  agreements  designated as cash flow hedges  involve the
receipt of  variable-rate  amounts in exchange for fixed-rate  payments over the
life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying  principal amount.
During  2002,  such  derivatives  were used to hedge  the  variable  cash  flows
associated with  variable-rate  debt.  Under an interest rate swap in place, the
Company received interest payments at a rate equal to LIBOR and paid interest at
a fixed rate of 5.83%.  The interest rate swap had a notional  amount of $80,000
and expired  August 30, 2003.  The change in net  unrealized  gains on cash flow
hedges in 2003 and 2002 reflects a reclassification of net unrealized gains from


                                       82

accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss to  interest  expense in the  amounts of
$2,397 and $4,387, respectively, related to this interest rate swap agreement.

NOTE 16.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     CBL's  Predecessor  and certain  officers of the Company have a significant
minority interest in the construction  company that the Company engaged to build
substantially  all of the  Company's  development  properties.  The Company paid
approximately $81,153, $163,617 and $96,185 to the construction company in 2004,
2003, and 2002, respectively,  for construction and development activities.  The
Company had accounts payable to the construction company of $7,774 and $8,082 at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

     The  Management  Company  provides  management,   development  and  leasing
services  to  the  Company's  unconsolidated  affiliates  and  other  affiliated
partnerships.  Revenues recognized for these services amounted to $5,970, $3,030
and $3,493 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

NOTE 17.  CONTINGENCIES

     The Company is currently  involved in certain litigation that arises in the
ordinary  course  of  business.  It is  management's  opinion  that the  pending
litigation  will not  materially  affect the  financial  position  or results of
operations of the Company.  Additionally,  management  believes  that,  based on
environmental  studies completed to date, any exposure to environmental  cleanup
will not materially  affect the financial  position and results of operations of
the Company.

     The  Company  has  guaranteed  50% of the debt of Parkway  Place  L.P.,  an
unconsolidated  affiliate  in which the Company owns a 45%  interest.  The total
amount  outstanding at December 31, 2004, was $53,323,  of which the Company has
guaranteed $26,662. The Company did not receive a fee for this guaranty.

     Under  the terms of the  partnership  agreement  of Mall of South  Carolina
L.P., an unconsolidated  affiliate in which the Company owns a 50% interest, the
Company had guaranteed 100% of the construction debt incurred to develop Coastal
Grand - Myrtle Beach in Myrtle Beach,  SC. The Company  received a fee of $1,572
for this guaranty when it was issued  during 2003.  The Company was  recognizing
one-half of this fee as revenue pro rata over the term of the guaranty until its
expiration in May 2006,  which represents the portion of the fee attributable to
the third-party  partner's ownership  interest.  As discussed in Note 5, Mall of
South Carolina L.P.  refinanced the construction loan with new mortgage loans in
September 2004. As a result, the Company recognized  one-half of the unamortized
balance of the guaranty fee, or $328, as revenue when the construction  loan was
retired. The remaining $328 attributable to the Company's ownership interest was
recorded as a reduction to the  Company's  investment  in the  partnership.  The
Company  recognized  total  revenue of $568 and $218  related  to this  guaranty
during 2004 and 2003, respectively.

     The Company has guaranteed  100% of the debt of Imperial  Valley Mall L.P.,
an unconsolidated  affiliate in which the Company owns a 60% interest. The total
amount outstanding at December 31, 2004 was $39,943.

     The Company has issued  various  bonds that it would have to satisfy in the
event of  non-performance.  The  total  amount  outstanding  on these  bonds was
$11,789 at December 31, 2004.

NOTE 18.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The carrying  values of cash and cash  equivalents,  receivables,  accounts
payable and accrued  liabilities  are reasonable  estimates of their fair values
because  of the short  maturity  of these  financial  instruments.  Based on the
interest rates for similar financial instruments, the carrying value of mortgage
notes  receivable  is a  reasonable  estimate of fair  value.  The fair value of
mortgage and other notes payable was  $3,667,151  and $3,094,285 at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The fair value was calculated by discounting future
cash flows for the notes  payable using  estimated  rates at which similar loans
would be made currently.

NOTE 19.  STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

     The Company  maintains the CBL & Associates  Properties,  Inc.  Amended and
Restated Stock  Incentive  Plan, as amended,  which permits the Company to issue
stock options and common stock to selected officers,  employees and directors of
the Company.  The shares  available under the plan were increased from 4,000,000
to 5,200,000 during 2002. The  Compensation  Committee of the Board of Directors
(the "Committee") administers the plan.

Stock Options

     Stock options  issued under the plan allow for the purchase of common stock
at the fair  market  value of the  stock on the  date of  grant.  Stock  options
granted to officers and employees vest and become exercisable in installments on
each of the first  five  anniversaries  of the date of grant and expire 10 years
after the date of grant.  Stock  options  granted to  independent  directors are
fully vested upon grant. However, the independent directors may not sell, pledge
or otherwise  transfer  their stock  options  during their board term or for one
year thereafter.

     The Company's  stock option  activity for 2004, 2003 and 2002 is summarized
as follows:

Stock Awards

     Under the plan,  common stock may be awarded either alone,  in addition to,
or in tandem with other stock awards  granted under the plan.  The Committee has
the  authority  to  determine  eligible  persons  to whom  common  stock will be
awarded,  the number of shares to be  awarded,  and the  duration of the vesting
period,  as defined.  The  Committee may also provide for the issuance of common
stock  under the plan on a deferred  basis  pursuant  to  deferred  compensation
arrangements, as described in Note 20.

     The Company  granted  awards for 46,800 and 43,225  shares of the Company's
common stock to employees in May 2004 and May 2003,  respectively.  The terms of
the awards allow for a recipient  to vest and receive  shares of common stock in
equal installments on each of the first five anniversaries of the date of grant.


                                       84
<PAGE>

Under  the  terms of the  awards,  the  Company  pays the  recipient  additional
compensation,  in an amount equal to the dividends paid on the Company's  common
stock,  on the  unvested  portion  of the  award as if the  recipient  owned the
unvested shares.

     The Company  recorded  deferred  compensation of $2,206 and $1,870 when the
awards  were  granted  in May 2004 and 2003,  respectively,  based on the market
value of the  Company's  common stock on the grant  dates,  which was $47.14 and
$43.06 per share, respectively.  The deferred compensation is being amortized on
a straight-line basis as compensation expense over the five-year vesting period.
The Company  recognized $664 and $248 of compensation  expense in 2004 and 2003,
respectively,  related to the amortization of deferred compensation. The Company
also  recorded a reduction  to deferred  compensation  of $68 and $15 for grants
that were canceled during 2004 and 2003, respectively.

     During 2004, the Company issued an additional 31,657 shares of common stock
to employees and nonemployee  directors with a weighted-average  grant date fair
value of $61.12. The shares vested immediately.

     During 2003, the Company issued an additional 43,606 shares of common stock
to employees and nonemployee  directors with a weighted-average  grant date fair
value of $43.01. The shares vested immediately.

     During 2002,  the Company issued 73,228 shares of common stock to employees
with a weighted  average  grant-date fair value of $35.21 per share.  There were
41,516  shares that vested  immediately.  The  remaining  31,712  shares vest at
various dates from 2003 to 2007.

NOTE 20.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

401(k) Plan

     The Management  Company  maintains a 401(k) profit  sharing plan,  which is
qualified under Section 401(a) and Section 401(k) of the Code to cover employees
of the  Management  Company.  All  employees who have attained the age of 21 and
have  completed at least one year of service are eligible to  participate in the
plan. The plan provides for employer  matching  contributions  on behalf of each
participant equal to 50% of the portion of such participant's  contribution that
does not  exceed  2.5% of such  participant's  compensation  for the plan  year.
Additionally,  the  Management  Company has the  discretion  to make  additional
profit-sharing-type   contributions   not   related  to   participant   elective
contributions. Total contributions by the Management Company were $657, $518 and
$439 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

     The Company  maintains an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible
employees  to acquire  shares of the  Company's  common stock in the open market
without  incurring  brokerage  or  transaction  fees.  Under the plan,  eligible
employees  make  payroll  deductions  that are used to  purchase  shares  of the
Company's  common stock.  The shares are purchased by the fifth  business day of
the month following the month when the deductions were withheld.  The shares are
purchased at the prevailing market price of the stock at the time of purchase.

Deferred Compensation Arrangements

     The Company has entered into  agreements  with certain of its officers that
allow the officers to defer receipt of selected  salary  increases  and/or bonus
compensation for periods ranging from 5 to 10 years.

     For certain officers,  the deferred compensation  arrangements provide that
when the salary increase or bonus compensation is earned and deferred, shares of
the  Company's  common  stock  issuable  under the  Amended and  Restated  Stock
Incentive  Plan are  deemed  set aside for the  amount  deferred.  The number of
shares  deemed set aside is  determined  by dividing the amount of  compensation
deferred by the fair value of the Company's  common stock on the deferral  date,
as  defined  in the  arrangements.  The  shares  set aside are deemed to receive
dividends equivalent to those paid on the Company's common stock, which are then
deemed to be  reinvested in the  Company's  common stock in accordance  with the
Company's  dividend  reinvestment  plan.  When an  arrangement  terminates,  the


                                       85
<PAGE>

Company  will  issue  shares  of the  Company's  common  stock  to  the  officer

cash.  At  December  31,  2004 and 2003,  respectively,  the  Company  had notes
