     CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION OR THE PURPOSE
OF THE "SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES  LITIGATION REFORM ACT
OF 1995

     This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains "forward-looking statements", such
as information relating to the Company's growth strategy,  projects targeted for
development  or  under  construction,   liquidity  and  capital  resources,  and
compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  Such statements are subject
to certain risks and  uncertainties  which could cause actual  results to differ
materially,  including,  but not limited to, those set forth below.  Readers are
cautioned  not to place  undue  reliance  on these  forward-looking  statements,
which, unless otherwise expressly indicated, speak only as of December 31, 2000.
The Company  undertakes no obligation to publicly  revise these  forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof or
to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

                                  PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

FORMATION OF THE COMPANY

     CBL &  Associates  Properties,  Inc.  (the  "Company")  is a  self-managed,
self-administered,  fully-integrated real estate company which is engaged in the
ownership,  operation, marketing,  management, leasing, expansion,  development,
redevelopment,  acquisition  and  financing of regional  malls and community and
neighborhood  centers.  The Company was  incorporated on July 13, 1993 under the
laws of the State of Delaware to acquire an interest in substantially all of the
real  estate  properties  owned by CBL &  Associates,  Inc.  and its  affiliates
("CBL") and to provide a public  vehicle  for the  expansion  of CBL's  shopping
center business.

     The  Company  conducts  substantially  all of its  business  through  CBL &
Associates Limited  Partnership,  a Delaware Limited Partnership (the "Operating
Partnership"), in which the Company owns an indirect 68.0% interest and of which
the Company's  wholly-owned  subsidiary is the sole general  partner.  To comply
with certain  technical  requirements  of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code") applicable to Real Estate Investment Trusts' ("REITs"), the
Company's property  management and development  activities,  sales of peripheral
land and  maintenance  and  security  operations  are  carried out through CBL &
Associates Management, Inc. (the "Management Company").

     On November 3, 1993, the Company completed the initial public offering (the
"Offering") of 15,400,000  shares of its common stock,  par value $.01 per share
(the "Common Stock").  Simultaneously  with the completion of the Offering,  CBL
transferred to the Operating Partnership substantially all of CBL's interests in
its real estate  properties  and its management  and  development  operations in
exchange  for an interest in the  Operating  Partnership.  CBL also  acquired an
additional interest in the Operating Partnership for a cash payment.

     The Offering  and the  application  of proceeds  therefrom,  including  the
Operating  Partnership's  acquisition  of certain  property  interests,  and the
contribution  by CBL of property  interests to the  Operating  Partnership,  are
referred to herein as the "Formation."

     In September 1995, the Company completed a follow-on  offering of 4,163,500
shares of its Common Stock at $20.625 per share. CBL purchased  150,000 of these
shares.

     In January 1997,  the Company  completed a follow-on  offering of 3,000,000
shares of its Common Stock at $26.125 per share.  CBL purchased  55,000 of these
shares.


                                        3
<PAGE>

     In June 1998, the Company  completed a public offering of 2,875,000  shares
of 9% Series A Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Stock (the "Series A Preferred
Stock") at a price to the public of $25.00 per share.  The net  proceeds  of $70
million were used to repay variable rate indebtedness  incurred in the Company's
development and acquisition programs.

     After  giving  effect to the above  transactions,  at December 31, 2000 CBL
(including  interests held by former  executives)  held a 25.5% limited  partner
interest in the  Operating  Partnership,  the Company  held a 68.0%  general and
limited partner  interest in the Operating  Partnership and third parties held a
6.5% limited partner interest. In addition,  CBL holds approximately 2.0 million
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock for a total ownership share of 30.9%.


     On September 25, 2000, the Company entered into a series of agreements with
Jacobs Realty  Investors  Limited  Partnership and certain of its affiliates and
partners  ("Jacobs") pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire from Jacobs
a portfolio of 21 malls and 2 associated centers for an aggregate  consideration
of  approximately  $1.3  billion.  The  transaction  closed on January 31, 2001.
Additionally,  in a separate transaction, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
interest in Madison Square Mall as of January 31, 2001. In connection with these
transactions,  the  Operating  Partnership  issued  approximately  12.7  million
special common units of the Operating Partnership ("SCUs"),  representing in the
aggregate  a 25.48%  limited  partner  interest  in the  Operating  Partnership.
Additionally,  in connection with these transactions,  the Operating Partnership
incurred or assumed an  aggregate $ 865.5  million of  additional  indebtedness.
After giving effect to this transaction, CBL (including interests held by former
executives)  held a  total  22.9%  ownership  interest  in the  Company  and the
Operating  Partnership,  the Company  held a 50.8%  general and limited  partner
interest in the Operating  Partnership  and Richard E. Jacobs and his affiliates
held a 23.0% limited partner interest in the Operating Partnership.

GENERAL

     The Company  owns  interests  in a  portfolio  of  properties,  which as of
December 31, 2000  consisted of 30 enclosed  regional  malls (the  "Malls"),  16
associated  centers  (the  "Associated  Centers"),  each of  which  is part of a
regional  shopping mall complex,  and 72 independent  community and neighborhood
shopping  centers (the  "Community  Centers").  Except for eleven  Malls,  three
Associated  Centers and four  Community  Centers  which were acquired from third
parties, each of these properties were developed by CBL or the Company.

     Additionally, as of December 31, 2000 the Company owned two regional Malls,
one office  building,  one  neighborhood  shopping center and one mall expansion
currently under construction (the "Construction  Properties").  The Company also
owned as of  December  31,  2000  options to  acquire  certain  shopping  center
development sites (the "Development Properties").

     The  Company  also  owned,   as  of  December  31,  2000,   mortgages  (the
"Mortgages")  on community and  neighborhood  shopping  centers owned by non-CBL
affiliates.  The  Mortgages  were  granted  in  connection  with sales by CBL of
certain  properties  previously  developed  by CBL.  The  Company  also  owns an
interest in a three-story office building in Chattanooga,  Tennessee,  a portion
of which  serves as the  Company's  headquarters  (the "Office  Building").  The
Malls,   Associated  Centers,   Community  Centers,   Construction   Properties,
Development  Properties,  Mortgages and Office Building (but without taking into
account  any  of  the  properties   acquired  in  the  Jacobs  transaction)  are
collectively  referred  to  herein as the  "Properties"  and  individually  as a
"Property".

     As of December 31, 2000 the Company had also entered into standby  purchase
agreements with  third-party  developers for the  construction,  development and
potential  ownership  of two  community  centers in Texas  (the  "Co-Development
Projects").  The developers have utilized these standby  purchase  agreements as
additional   security  for  their  lenders  to  fund  the  construction  of  the
Co-Development  Projects.  The  standby  purchase  agreements  for  each  of the
Co-Development   Projects   require  the   Company  to   purchase   the  related
Co-Development   Project  upon  such  Co-Development   Project  meeting  certain
completion  requirements  and rental  levels.  In return for its  commitment  to
purchase a Co-Development Project pursuant to a standby purchase agreement,  the
Company   receives  a  fee  as  well  as  a   participation   interest  in  each
Co-Development Project. The outstanding amount of standby purchase agreements at
December 31, 2000 is $51.4 million.



                                        4
<PAGE>

     The Company and the Operating  Partnership generally own a 100% interest in
the  Properties.  With two  exceptions,  where  the  Company  and the  Operating
Partnership  own  less  than  a  100%  interest  in a  Property,  the  Operating
Partnership is the sole general  partner,  managing  general partner or managing
member of the property  partnership or limited liability company which owns such
Property  (each a  "Property  Partnership").  For one  Mall  and its  Associated
Center,  affiliates  of  the  Operating  Partnership  are  non-managing  general
partners in the two applicable Property Partnerships.

     For a full description of the Properties, see Item 2 -- "Properties."

     The Company's executive offices are located at 6148 Lee Highway, Suite 300,
Chattanooga, Tennessee 37421-6511. The telephone number at this address is (423)
855-0001.

MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION OF PROPERTIES

     Management Company

     The Company is self-managed and  self-administered.  To comply with certain
technical  requirements  of the Code,  the  Company's  property  management  and
development  activities,  sales of peripheral  land and maintenance and security
operations are carried out through the Management Company.

     The Operating  Partnership  holds 100% of the preferred stock and 5% of the
common stock of the Management Company. The remaining 95% of the common stock is
held by Charles  Lebovitz,  his family and his associates.  Substantially all of
CBL's  asset  management,   property  management  and  leasing  and  development
operations,   including  CBL's  executive,   property,   financial,   legal  and
administrative  personnel, were transferred to the Management Company as part of
the Formation.  The Management Company manages all of the Properties (except for
Governor's  Square and Governor's Plaza in Clarksville,  Tennessee -- see below)
under a management agreement that may be terminated at any time by the Operating
Partnership  upon 30 days written notice.  In addition,  the Management  Company
manages certain properties owned by CBL that were not transferred to the Company
in  the  Formation  as  well  as  certain  shopping  centers  owned  by  non-CBL
affiliates.  Through its ownership of the Management  Company's preferred stock,
the Operating  Partnership enjoys  substantially all of the economic benefits of
the  Management  Company's  business.  Requirements  set forth in the Management
Company's  Amended  and  Restated  Certificate  of  Incorporation,  state that a
majority of the  Management  Company's  board of  directors  are  required to be
independent  of CBL.  From  November  1993 to the  current  date,  the  board of
directors of the Management Company has consisted of seven of the members of the
Company's  board  of  directors,  including  four of the  Company's  independent
directors.

     On-Site Management

     The on-site  property  management  functions at the Malls include  leasing,
management,  data processing, rent collection,  project bookkeeping,  budgeting,
marketing, and promotion.  Each Mall, for itself and its Associated Centers, has
an on-site  property  manager  who  oversees  the  on-site  staff and an on-site
marketing  director who oversees the marketing  program for that Mall.  District
managers,  most of whom are located at the Company's  headquarters,  oversee the
leasing and operations at a majority of the Community Centers.  The on-site Mall
managers are experienced managers with training in mall management.


                                        5
<PAGE>

     Virtually  all  operating  activities  of the  Company are  supported  by a
computer software system which is designed to provide  management with operating
data  necessary  to make  informed  business  decisions on a timely  basis.  The
Company has a program of on-going upgrades to hardware and software that support
the accounting and management  information  system. The Company also maintains a
web site to  publish  integrated  information  on the  world  wide web about the
Company and the  properties.  These systems were  developed to more  efficiently
assist  management  in  efforts to market the  properties,  maintain  management
quality,  enhance  investor  relations  and  communications  and enhance  tenant
relations while minimizing  operating expenses.  Retail sales analysis,  leasing
information,  budget controls,  accounts  receivable/payable,  operating expense
variance  reports and income analysis are  continually  available to management.
Through these systems management also has available information that facilitates
the development and monitoring of budgets and other relevant information.

     Management pursues periodic  preventative  property  maintenance  programs,
which  encompass  paving,   roofing,   HVAC  and  general  improvements  to  the
Properties' common areas. The on-site property managers oversee all such work in
accordance with approved budgets with the coordination of, and reporting to home
office management.

     Governor's Square

     Governor's  Square and  Governor's  Plaza were the only  Properties  in the
Company's  portfolio  on December 31, 2000 in which the Company was not the sole
general partner or managing  general  partner.  Governor's  Square is owned by a
Property  Partnership,  the  managing  general  partner  of which  is a  non-CBL
affiliate which owns a 47.5% interest in the Mall. The Company is a non-managing
general partner of Governor's  Plaza.  Although the managing  general partner of
this  partnership  controls  the  timing  of  distributions  of cash  flow,  the
Company's approval is required for certain major decisions,  including permanent
financing, refinancing and sale of all or substantially all of the partnership's
assets.   Property  management   services,   including   accounting,   auditing,
maintenance,  promotional  programs,  leasing,  collection  and  insurance,  are
performed by a property  manager  affiliated with the non-CBL  managing  general
partner for which such property manager receives a fee.

EMPLOYEES

     The   Company,   through  the   Management   Company,   currently   employs
approximately  560 full time and 517 part time persons.  None of these employees
is currently  represented by any union.  The Company does not have any employees
other than its statutory officers.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations,  a
current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs
of removal or remediation of petroleum,  certain  hazardous or toxic  substances
on,  under or in such real estate.  Such laws  typically  impose such  liability
without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for,
the presence of such  substances.  The costs of  remediation  or removal of such
substances  may be  substantial,  and the  presence of such  substances,  or the
failure to promptly remediate such substances,  may adversely affect the owner's
or  operator's  ability  to sell such real  estate or to borrow  using such real
estate as  collateral.  Persons  who arrange for the  disposal or  treatment  of
hazardous  or toxic  substances  may also be liable  for the costs of removal or
remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility, regardless
of whether such facility is owned or operated by such person.  Certain laws also
impose requirements on conditions and activities that may affect the environment
or the impact of the  environment  on human health.  Failure to comply with such
requirements  could result in the imposition of monetary  penalties (in addition
to the costs to achieve compliance) and potential  liabilities to third parties.
Among other  things,  certain laws  require  abatement or removal of friable and
certain  non-friable  asbestos-containing  materials  ("ACMs")  in the  event of
demolition or certain  renovations  or  remodeling.  Certain laws regarding ACMs
require  building  owners and lessees,  among other things,  to notify and train
certain  employees  working in areas known or presumed to contain ACMs.  Certain
laws also impose  liability  for release of ACMs into the air and third  parties
may seek  recovery  from owners or  operators  of real  properties  for personal
injury or property damage associated with ACMs. In connection with its ownership
and operation of the Properties,  the Company, the Operating  Partnership or the
relevant Property Partnership, as the case may be, may be potentially liable for
such costs or claims.



                                        6
<PAGE>


     All of the Properties (excluding properties upon which the Company holds an
option  to  purchase  but  does  not yet  own)  have  been  subject  to  Phase I
environmental   assessments  or  updates  of  existing  Phase  I   environmental
assessments by independent environmental consultants. Such assessments generally
consisted of a visual inspection of the Properties,  review of federal and state
environmental  databases and certain information  regarding historic uses of the
Property and adjacent areas and the preparation and issuance of written reports.
Some of the Properties contain, or contained, underground storage tanks ("UST"s)
used  for  storing  petroleum  products  or  wastes  typically  associated  with
automobile service or other operations  conducted at the Properties.  At Parkway
Place in Huntsville  Alabama  asbestos  abatement  will occur in portions of the
existing mall during demolition which will be completed by the end of the second
quarter  of  2001.  Certain  Properties  contain,  or  contained,   dry-cleaning
establishments  utilizing solvents.  Where believed to be warranted,  samples of
building materials or subsurface investigations were, or, will be undertaken. At
certain Properties, where warranted by the conditions, the Company has developed
and implemented an operations and maintenance program that establishes operating
procedures  with respect to ACMs. The costs  associated with the development and
implementation for such programs were not material.

     Although there can be no assurances that such environmental  liability does
not exist,  other than Parkway Place none of the environmental  assessments have
identified  and the  Company is not aware of any  environmental  liability  with
respect  to the  Properties  that the  Company  believes  would  have a material
adverse effect on the Company's  financial  condition,  results of operations or
cash flows.  Nevertheless,  it is possible  that the  environmental  assessments
available to the Company do not reveal all potential environmental  liabilities,
that  subsequent  investigations  will  identify  material  contamination,  that
adverse  environmental  conditions have arisen  subsequent to the performance of
the  environmental  assessments,   or  that  there  are  material  environmental
liabilities of which management is unaware. Moreover, no assurances can be given
that (i) future laws,  ordinances  or  regulations  will not impose any material
environmental  liability  or (ii) the  current  environmental  condition  of the
Properties  has not been or will not be affected by tenants and occupants of the
Properties,  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the Properties or
by third  parties  unrelated to the Company,  the Operating  Partnership  or the
relevant Property Partnership. The existence of any such environmental liability
could have an adverse effect on the Company's  results of operations,  cash flow
and the funds available to the Company to pay dividends.

     The  Company has not  recorded in its  financial  statements  any  material
liability in connection with environmental matters.

GENERAL RISKS OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS

     General Factors  Affecting  Investments in Shopping  Center  Properties and
     Effect of Economic and Real Estate Conditions

     A shopping  center's  revenues  and value may be  adversely  affected  by a
number of factors, including: the national and regional economic climates; local
real estate  conditions (such as an oversupply of retail space);  perceptions by
retailers  or shoppers  of the safety,  convenience  and  attractiveness  of the
shopping center;  and the willingness and ability of the shopping center's owner
to provide  capable  management and  maintenance  services.  In addition,  other
factors may adversely  affect a shopping  center's  value without  affecting its
current revenues, including: changes in governmental regulations,  zoning or tax
laws;  potential  environmental  or other  legal  liabilities;  availability  of
financing;  and changes in interest  rate levels.  There are  numerous  shopping
facilities  that compete with the  Properties in  attracting  retailers to lease
space. In addition,  retailers at the Properties face continued competition from
discount  shopping  centers,   outlet  malls,   wholesale  clubs,  direct  mail,
telemarketing,  television  shopping  networks and  shopping  via the  Internet.
Competition  could  adversely  affect the Operating  Partnership's  revenues and
funds  available  for  distribution  to partners,  which in turn will affect the
Company's revenues and funds available for distribution to stockholders.

     Geographic Concentration

     The Properties are located principally in the southeastern United States in
Alabama,  Florida,  Georgia,  Kentucky,   Mississippi,   North  Carolina,  South
Carolina,  Tennessee and Virginia.  Twenty Malls,  fifteen  Associated  Centers,
fifty-four  Community  Centers  and the  Office  Building  are  located in these
states. The Company's results of operations and funds available for distribution
to stockholders  therefore will be subject  generally to economic  conditions in
the southeastern  United States. As of December 31, 2000, the Properties located
in the  southeastern  United States  accounted for 65.0% of the Company's  total
assets,  and provided  65.6% of the Company's  total revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2000. After giving effect to the Jacobs  transaction the properties
located in the  southeastern  United  States  account for 64.6% of the Company's
total assets.

     Third Party Interests In Certain Properties

     As of December 31, 2000 the Operating  Partnership  owned partial interests
in seven Malls,  five  Associated  Centers,  one  Community  Center,  the Office
Building  and two Malls  under  development.  The  Operating  Partnership  or an
affiliate  of the  Company  is the  managing  general  partner  of the  Property
Partnerships that own such Properties, except for the Governor's Square Mall and
its Associated  Center,  Governor's  Plaza, in which affiliates of the Operating
Partnership are non-managing general partners.

     Where the  Operating  Partnership  serves as  managing  general  partner of
Property  Partnerships,  it may have certain fiduciary  responsibilities  to the
other partners in those partnerships.  In certain cases, the approval or consent
of the other  partners is required  before the Operating  Partnership  may sell,
finance,  expand or make other  significant  changes in the  operations  of such
Properties. To the extent such approvals or consents are required, the Operating
Partnership may experience  difficulty in, or may be prevented from implementing
its plans with respect to  expansion,  development,  financing or other  similar
transactions with respect to such Properties.

     With respect to  Governor's  Square and  Governor's  Plaza,  the  Operating
Partnership does not have day-to-day operational control or control over certain
major decisions,  including the timing and amount of distributions,  which could
result in decisions by the managing  general  partner that do not fully  reflect
the interests of the Company, including decisions relating to the standards that
the Company is  required  to satisfy in order to  maintain  its status as a real
estate investment trust for tax purposes.  However decisions  relating to sales,
expansions,  dispositions  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  assets  and
financings, are subject to approval by the Operating Partnership. On January 31,
2001, in the Jacobs transaction the Company acquired a non-managing  interest in
Kentucky  Oaks Mall.  This  investment  will be subject to similar  risks as the
investments in Governor's Square and Governor's Plaza.

     Dependence on Significant Properties

     Hamilton  Place Mall in  Chattanooga,  Tennessee,  Coolsprings  Galleria in
Nashville,   Tennessee  and  Burnsville  Center  in  Minneapolis   (Burnsville),
Minnesota and accounted for approximately 4.9%, 4.7% and 4.7%, respectively,  of
total  revenues of the Company  for the period  ended  December  31,  2000.  The
Company's  financial  position  and  results of  operations  will  therefore  be
disproportionately  affected by the  results  experienced  at these  Properties.
Hamilton  Place  Mall  was  renovated  in 1999 and the  Company  has  started  a
renovation  of  Burnsville  Center in 2001.  After  giving  effect to the Jacobs
transaction, Hanes Mall in  Winston-Salem,  North Carolina  would  represent the
largest revenue producing  property in the combined  portfolio.  Hamilton Place,
Coolsprings  Galleria and  Burnsville  Center would then represent the next most
significant revenue producing properties. The Company will begin a renovation of
Hanes Mall in 2001.  Generally,  a renovation is a pro action step taken to both
preserve and enhance a properties dominant position in its markets.

     Dependence on Key Tenants

     As of December  31,  2000,  The Limited  Inc.  Stores  (including  Intimate
Brands, Inc.) maintained 121 stores in the Company's properties and in the year
ended  December 31, 2000 accounted for  approximately  6.5% of total revenues of
the Company.  As of December 31, 2000, the Venator Group,  Inc.  (Champs Sports,
Footlocker,  etc.)  had 74  stores  and in the year  ended  December  31,  2000,
accounted  for 2.5% of the total  revenues of the  Company.  As of December  31,
2000, The Gap, Inc. (The Gap, Gap Kids, Old Navy, etc.) had 36 stores and in the
year ended  December 31, 2000,  accounted for 2.1% of the total  revenues of the
Company.  Except for theses top three tenants no other tenant provided more than
2% of total revenues for the year ended  December 31, 2000.  After giving effect
to the Jacobs  Transaction The Limited stores (including  Intimate Brands,  Inc)
would  have 209  stores  and would  represent  9.0% of the mall store GLA in the
combined  portfolio,  the Venator  Group,  Inc.  would have 142 stores and would
represent  3.0% of mall store GLA in the combined  portfolio  and The Gap,  Inc.
would have 62 stores and represent  3.5% of mall store GLA.  These tenants would
represent  approximately  the  same  proportion  of  total  revenues  after  the
transaction  as  before.  The loss or  bankruptcy  of any of these or other  key
tenants could negatively affect the Company's  financial position and results of
operations.


THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY FOR GROWTH

     Management  believes  that per share  growth in the  Company's  Funds  from
Operations, as defined below, is one of the key factors in enhancing shareholder
value.  Management  also  believes  that Funds from  Operations is a widely used
measure of the operating performance of REITs, and its consistent  determination
provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. It is the objective of the
Company's  management  to achieve  growth in Funds from  Operations  through the
aggressive  management of the Company's existing  Properties,  the expansion and
renovation of existing Properties, the development of new properties, and select
acquisitions.  Funds from  Operations can also be affected by external  factors,
such as inflation, fluctuations in interest rates or changes in general economic
conditions, which are beyond the control of the Company's management.

     "Funds  from  Operations"  is defined by the  Company as net income  (loss)
before property depreciation,  other non-cash items, gains or losses on sales of
real estate assets and gains or losses on investments in marketable  securities.
The  National  Association  of Real  Estate  Investment  Trusts  ("NAREIT")  has
clarified  the  definition  of Funds from  Operations  to include all  operating
results  -  recurring  and  non-recurring  - except  those  results  defined  as
"extraordinary  items" under  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
United States.  The Company  implemented this clarification in the first quarter
of 2000 and no longer  adds back to FFO the  development  costs  charged  to net
income.  This amount was  $127,000 for the year ended  December  31,  2000.  For
comparative  purposes,  the Company has  recomputed  its 1999 FFO to exclude the
add-back of development  costs charged to net income of $1,674,000.  The cost of
interest  rate caps and  finance  costs on the  Company's  lines of  credit  are
amortized and included in interest  expense and,  therefore,  reduces Funds from
Operations.  Funds from  Operations  also includes the Company's  share of Funds
from Operations in unconsolidated  properties and excludes  minority  interests'
share of Funds from Operations in consolidated properties.  The Company excludes
outparcel  sales from its Funds from  Operations  calculation,  even  though the
NAREIT  definition  allows  their  inclusion.  Funds  from  Operations  does not
represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted  accounting
principals  ("GAAP") and is not  necessarily  indicative of cash  available from
operations  to fund  all  cash  flow  needs  and  should  not be  considered  an
alternative  to net income  (loss) for  purposes  of  evaluating  the  Company's
operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

     The Company  classifies its regional malls into two categories - stabilized
malls  ("Stabilized  Malls") which have completed their initial lease-up and new
malls  ("New  Malls")  which are in their  initial  lease-up  phase or are being
redeveloped.  At December  31,  2000,  the New Mall  category  was  comprised of
Springdale  Mall in Mobile,  Alabama  which was acquired in  September  1997 and
which is  currently  being  redeveloped  and  retenanted;  Bonita  Lakes Mall in
Meridian,  Mississippi  which  opened in  October  1997;  Parkway  Place Mall in
Huntsville,  Alabama  which was  acquired in  December,  1998 and which is being
redeveloped and Arbor Place in Atlanta (Douglasville),  Georgia, which opened in
October 1999.

     Specifically,  the Company has  implemented  its  objective  of growing its
Funds from Operations and will continue to do so by:


     o    Acquiring existing retail properties where cash flow can be enhanced
          by improved management, leasing, redevelopment and expansion.


          --   On September 25, 2000,  the Company agreed to acquire from Jacobs
               interests in twenty-one  malls and two  associated  centers.  The
               transaction  closed on January 31, 2001. The total gross leasable
               area of the twenty-three  properties is 19.2 million square feet,
               or an average  gross  leasable  area of 914,000  square  feet per
               mall. The gross leasable area of Mall Stores is approximately 5.9
               million  square  feet.  The malls are  located in middle  markets
               predominantly  in the  Southeast  and the  Midwest.  Following is
               certain information concerning properties acquired from Jacobs:

                    -    In   general,   the  Company   seeks  out   development
                         opportunities  in  middle-market  trade  areas  that it
                         believes   are   under-serviced   by  existing   retail
                         facilities,  have  demonstrated  improving  demographic
                         trends or otherwise afford an opportunity for effective
                         market penetration and competitive presence.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S GROWTH STRATEGY

     In connection with the implementation of this growth strategy,  the Company
and the Operating  Partnership  will incur various risks including the risk that
development or expansion opportunities explored by the Company and the Operating
Partnership may be abandoned;  the risk that construction costs of a project may
exceed original estimates,  possibly making the project not profitable; the risk
that the  Company and the  Operating  Partnership  may not be able to  refinance
construction loans which are generally with full recourse to the Company and the
Operating  Partnership;  the risk that occupancy  rates and rents at a completed
project will not meet  projections,  and will therefore be  insufficient to make
the project  profitable;  and the need for anchor,  mortgage lender and property
partner  approvals  for  certain  expansion  activities.  In  the  event  of  an
unsuccessful  development project, the Company's and the Operating Partnership's
loss could exceed its investment in the project.

     The Company has in the past elected not to proceed with certain development
projects  and  anticipates  that it will do so  again  from  time to time in the
future. If the Company elects not to proceed with a development opportunity, the
development costs associated therewith ordinarily will be charged against income
and Funds From  Operations for the  then-current  period.  Any such charge could
have a material  adverse  effect on the Company's  results of operations for the
period in which the charge is taken.

COMPETITION

     There are numerous shopping  facilities that compete with the Properties in
attracting  retailers  to lease  space.  The  Malls  are  generally  located  in
middle-markets.  Management  believes  that the Malls  have  strong  competitive
positions  because they generally are the only or largest  enclosed malls within
their  respective  trade areas.  In addition,  retailers at the Properties  face
continued  competition from discount shopping centers,  outlet malls,  wholesale
clubs, direct mail, telemarketing, television shopping networks and shopping via
the Internet.  Competition  could adversely  affect the Operating  Partnership's
revenues and funds available for  distributions to partners,  which in turn will
affect  the  Company's   revenues  and  funds  available  for   distribution  to
stockholders.

SEASONALITY

     The  Company's  business is somewhat  seasonal in nature with tenant  sales
achieving the highest  levels during the fourth  quarter  because of the holiday
season.  The Malls earn most of their  "temporary"  rents (rents from short-term
tenants)  during  the  holiday  period.   Thus,  occupancy  levels  and  revenue
production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year. Results
of  operations  realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results
likely to be experienced over the course of the entire year.

QUALIFICATION AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST

     The Company has elected to be taxed as real estate  investment  trust under
the Code,  commencing  with its taxable year ended  December 31, 1993,  and will
seek to maintain such status.  As a qualified real estate  investment trust, the
Company  generally  will not be subject  to Federal  income tax to the extent it
distributes  at least 90% of its  current  year  real  estate  investment  trust
taxable  income to its  shareholders.  If the Company fails to qualify as a real
estate  investment  trust in any taxable  year,  the Company  will be subject to
Federal income tax (including  any  applicable  alternative  minimum tax) on its
taxable income at regular corporate rates.

INSURANCE

     The Operating Partnership carries comprehensive  liability,  fire, extended
coverage  and rental loss  insurance  covering all the  Properties,  with policy
specifications  and insured limits customarily  carried for similar  properties.
Management  believes that the Properties  are  adequately  insured in accordance
with industry standards.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.

MALLS

     Each of the  Malls is an  enclosed  regional  shopping  complex.  Each Mall
generally  has at least  three  Anchors  which  own or lease  their  stores  and
numerous  non-anchor  stores  with GLA  less  than  30,000  square  feet  ("Mall
Stores"),  most of which are  national  or  regional  retailers,  located  along
enclosed  malls  connecting  the  Anchors.  At  most  of the  Malls,  additional
freestanding  restaurants  and retail stores are located on the periphery of the
Mall  complex.  These  freestanding  stores are,  in most cases,  owned by their
occupants.  As of December 31, 2000, thirteen of the Mall complexes included one
or more Associated Centers.

     The total GLA of the 30 Malls owned on December 31, 2000 was  approximately
22.6 million square feet or an average GLA of approximately  754,000 square feet
per  Mall.   Mall  Store  GLA  was  8,033,000   square  feet  including   leased
free-standing  buildings at December 31, 2000.  The Company wholly owned all but
seven of such Malls and managed all but one of them.

     In the  years  ended  December  31,  1998,  1999 and  2000,  Mall  revenues
represented  approximately  74.9%,  76.9%  and  77.3%,  respectively,  of  total
revenues from the Company's Properties.

     Occupancy of mall stores in the Stabilized Malls ("Stabilized Mall Stores")
was 94.5% at December 31, 1999, and at December 31, 2000.

     In the years ended  December 31, 1998,  1999 and 2000,  average  Stabilized
Mall  Store  sales per  square  foot were  approximately  $272.00,  $283.75  and
$283.00, respectively (computed using a monthly weighted average).

     Average base rent per square foot at the Mall Stores  increased from $20.73
at December 31, 1999 to $21.57 at December 31, 2000.

     Occupancy  costs as a  percentage  of sales for  tenants in the  Stabilized
Malls  (excluding  acquisition  malls from the year of acquisition)  were 11.1%,
11.5%  and  11.9%  for the  years  ended  December  31,  1998,  1999,  and 2000,
respectively.

     The Malls are generally located in middle-markets. Management believes that
the Malls have strong competitive positions because they generally are the only,
or the dominant enclosed malls within their respective trade areas.  Trade areas
have  been  identified  by  management   based  upon  a  number  of  sources  of
information,   including  the  location  of  other  malls,   publicly  available
population information, customer surveys, surveys of customer automobile license
plates, as well as ZIP codes and third-party market studies.

     The three largest revenue-producing Malls in 2000 were Hamilton Place Mall,
Coolsprings  Galleria  and  Burnsville  Center.  Hamilton  Place is located on a
187-acre  site in  Chattanooga,  Tennessee and  represented,  as of December 31,
2000, 3.4% of the  Properties'  total GLA, 3.6% of total Mall Store GLA and 4.9%
of total revenues from the Company's Properties. Coolsprings Galleria is located
on a 150-acre site in Nashville,  Tennessee and represented,  as of December 31,
2000, 3.4% of the  Properties'  total GLA, 3.6% of total Mall Store GLA and 4.7%
of total revenues from the Company's Properties. Burnsville Center is located in
the Suburbs of  Minneapolis,  Minnesota in  Burnsville  and  represented,  as of
December 31, 2000, 3.1% of the  Properties'  total GLA, 3.9% of total Mall Store
GLA and 4.7% of total revenues from the Company's Properties.

     Twenty-four of the thirty Malls owned on December 31, 2000 had undergone an
expansion or remodeling since their opening,  and all but four of the Malls were
either built,  renovated or expanded in the last 10 years one of which,  Parkway
Place in Huntsville, Alabama is currently scheduled for

                                       16

demolition and  redevelopment.  In 2000, the Company renovated and expanded
Asheville  Mall in  Asheville,  North  Carolina  and  Meridian  Mall in Lansing,
Michigan.  The Company will  complete the expansion of Meridian Mall in 2001 and
will begin the  renovation of  Burnsville  Center in  Minneapolis  (Burnsville),
Minnesota   and  three   malls  in  the  Jacobs   transaction:   Hanes  Mall  in
Winston-Salem,  North  Carolina,  Fashion  Square in Saginaw,  Michigan and Cary
Towne Center in Cary,  North  Carolina.  At December 31, 2000 three of the Malls
have available Anchor pads providing expansion potential totaling  approximately
405,700  buildable  square feet. At December 31, 2000 twenty existing Anchors at
eleven Malls have  aggregate  expansion  potential at their  existing  stores of
approximately 473,000 buildable square feet.

     The land  underlying  the Malls owned on December 31, 2000 was owned in fee
simple in all cases, except for Walnut Square,  WestGate Mall, St. Clair Square,
Bonita  Lakes Mall,  Meridian  Mall and Stroud  Mall which were each  subject to
long-term ground leases for all or a portion of their land.

     The table on the following page sets forth certain  information for each of
the Malls as of December 31, 2000.

     Anchors.  Anchors  are a critical  factor in a Mall's  success  because the
public's  identification with a property typically focuses on its Anchors.  Mall
Anchors  generally are department  stores whose  merchandise  appeals to a broad
range of  shoppers.  Although  the Malls  derive a smaller  percentage  of their
operating  income from Anchor stores than from Mall Stores,  strong Anchors play
an important part in generating  customer traffic and making the Malls desirable
locations for Mall Store tenants.

     Anchors  either  own  their  stores  together  with  the land  under  them,
sometimes  with adjacent  parking  areas,  or enter into  long-term  leases with
respect to their  stores at rental rates that are  significantly  lower than the
rents charged to tenants of Mall Stores.  Anchors account for approximately 7.1%
of the total revenues from the Company's Properties.  Each Anchor which owns its
own store has entered  into a  reciprocal  easement  agreement  with the Company
covering,  among  other  things,  operating  covenants,   reciprocal  easements,
property operations, initial construction and future expansions.

     As of  December  31,  2000,  the Malls had a total of 135  Anchors  and one
vacant Anchor store at Asheville  Mall. The following  table  indicates all Mall
Anchors  and sets forth the  aggregate  number of square feet owned or leased by
Anchors in the Malls as of December 31, 2000.

profitably.  A major factor contributing to tenant profitability is the tenant's

ASSOCIATED CENTERS

     The sixteen Associated Centers owned at December 31, 2000 were each part of
a Mall complex and generally had one or two Anchor  tenants and various  smaller
tenants.   Anchor   tenants  in  these  centers   included  such   retailers  as
Books-A-Million,  Target, Toys "R" Us, TJ Maxx, and Goody's, which were category
dominant  retailers  that  benefited  from the regional  draw of the Malls.  The
Associated Centers also generally increase the draw to the total Mall complex.

     Total leasable GLA of the sixteen  Associated Centers was approximately 2.5
million square feet,  including Anchors, or an average of approximately  156,000
square feet per center.  As of December 31, 2000, 94.9% of total leasable GLA at
the  Associated  Centers  was  occupied.  During  2000 the  Company  opened  one
Associated Center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

     In the years ended  December 31, 1998,  1999,  and 2000,  revenues from the
Associated Centers represented  approximately 3.9%, 3.7% and 4.1%, respectively,
of total revenues from the Company's Properties.

     In the years ended December 31, 1998,  1999 and 2000,  average tenant sales
per square foot at the  Associated  Centers were  approximately  $172,  $184 and

COMMUNITY AND POWER CENTERS

     In addition to Mall development, the Company's development activities focus
on  Community  Centers,   and  power  centers.   Community  Centers  pose  fewer
development  risks than Malls because they have shorter  development  timetables
and lower  up-front  costs.  Community  Centers  also  afford  the  Company  the
opportunity  to meet the needs of  retailers  for whom a  "convenience"  type of
location is more appropriate and the needs of customers whose trade areas cannot
support a regional mall. Power centers are larger than other Community  Centers,
with several large anchor  stores which draw  shoppers  from a wider  geographic
area.

     The Company's  Community  Center  developments in the 1980's were generally
anchored by  supermarkets,  and, in certain cases, by drug stores.  Management's
current  focus has  expanded  to  include  the  development  of larger  centers,
anchored by mass  merchandisers  and  department  stores,  while  continuing the
development  of  smaller  centers  anchored  by  supermarkets  and drug  stores.
Recently  completed  Community  Centers include centers in Richmond Virginia and
Spring Hill, Florida.  Anchors at these new centers include,  Home Depot, Sears,
Belk,  Goody's and , Wal*Mart.  During 2000, the Company sold thirteen Community
Centers for total proceeds of $51 million and totaling  799,000 square feet. The
proceeds were primarily used to retire debt. The Company also sold one Community
Center Jean Ribaut Square in Beaufort,  South Carolina in February 2001. The net
proceeds of $5.8  million were placed in escrow in  anticipation  of a like-kind
exchange of properties under section 1031 of the Code.

     Community  Centers,  other than power  centers,  range in size from  25,000
square feet to in excess of 286,000  square feet.  Anchors in Community  Centers
generally  lease  their  store space and occupy  60-85% of a center's  GLA.  The
number  of stores in a  Community  Center  ranges  from one to  sixteen  with an
average of seven stores per center.

     The Company's two power  centers,  which were  completed and opened in 1997
and 1998,  average  786,000 square feet and have an average of nine major anchor
stores and  additional  small shop space  ranging  from  38,000  square  feet to
136,000 square feet. The projects  include  expansion areas for additional major
retailers.   These  power   centers  are  included  in  the   Community   Center
classification in this report.

     Total GLA of the 72 Community  Centers is approximately  9.1 million square

MORTGAGES

     The Company owns certain Mortgages which were granted prior to the Offering
in connection with sales by CBL of properties which it had previously developed.

     The Company holds fee mortgages on seven community centers, which mortgages
had, as of December 31, 2000, an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $7.2
million. Such mortgages entitle the Company to receive substantially all of such
properties' current cash flow in the form of periodic debt service payments. The
encumbered  properties  all  opened  between  1981 and 1984 and have one  Anchor
vacancy.

     In the years ended  December 31, 1998,  1999,  and 2000,  revenues from the
Mortgages represented approximately 0.7%, 0.6%, and 0.3%, respectively, of total
revenues from the Company's Properties.

MORTGAGE DEBT AND RATIO TO TOTAL MARKET CAPITALIZATION

     As of December 31, 2000, the Operating Partnership's proportionate share of
indebtedness  of all  Properties  (whether  or not  consolidated  for  financial
statement  reporting  purposes,   including  the  Construction  Properties)  was
approximately  $1.452 billion.  The Company's total market  capitalization  (the
aggregate  market  value of the  Company's  outstanding  shares  of  Common  and
Preferred Stock, assuming the full exchange of the limited partnership interests
in the Operating  Partnership  for Common Stock,  plus the $1.452  billion total
debt of the  Operating  Partnership)  as of December 31, 2000 was $2.4  billion.
Accordingly,  the  Company's  debt to total  market  capitalization  ratio as of
December  31, 2000 was 59.4%.  The debt to total  market  capitalization  ratio,
which is based  upon  the  Company's  proportionate  share of  consolidated  and
unconsolidated   indebtedness   and  market  values  of  equity,   differs  from
debt-to-book   capitalization   ratios,   which  are  based  upon   consolidated
indebtedness and book values.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
         AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


     The  following  discussion  and  analysis of the  financial  condition  and
results  of  operations  should  be read in  conjunction  with CBL &  Associates
Properties, Inc. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.

     Information included herein may contain "forward-looking statements" within
the meaning of the federal  securities  laws.  Such  statements  are  inherently
subject  to risks and  uncertainties,  many of which  cannot be  predicted  with
accuracy  and some of which  might not even be  anticipated.  Future  events and
actual results,  financial and otherwise,  may differ materially from the events
and results discussed in the  forward-looking  statements.  We direct you to the
Company's  other  filings  with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  and
elsewere in this Annual  Report on Form 10-K for a discussion  of such risks and
uncertainties.

GENERAL BACKGROUND

     On November 3, 1993,  CBL & Associates  Properties,  Inc.  (the  "Company")
completed an initial public offering of 15,400,000 shares of common stock priced
at $19.50 per share (the "Offerings").  In connection with the Offerings,  CBL &
Associates, Inc. and its affiliates contributed their interests in properties to
CBL & Associates Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership").  The Company
is indirectly the sole general partner and as of December 31, 2000, the majority
owner,  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  As a  result,  the  CBL  &  Associates
Properties, Inc. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto reflect the
consolidated financial results of the Operating  Partnership,  which included at
December 31, 2000, the operations of a portfolio of properties  consisting of 26
regional malls, 15 associated centers,  two power centers, 70 community centers,
an office  building,  joint venture  investments  in four regional malls and one
associated  center,  and income from seven  mortgages  (the"Properties").  As of
December 31, 2000, the Operating  Partnership had under  construction two malls,
one community center, one office building, one mall expansion,  and owns options
to acquire certain shopping center development sites. The consolidated financial
statements  also include the results of CBL & Associates  Management,  Inc. (the
"Management Company").

     The Company  classifies its regional malls into two categories - stabilized
malls which have  completed  their  initial  lease-up and new malls which are in
their initial  lease-up phase. As of December 31, 2000 the new mall category was
comprised of Springdale Mall in Mobile, Alabama, which was acquired in September
1997 and is being  redeveloped  and  retenanted;  Bonita Lakes Mall in Meridian,
Mississippi, which opened in October 1997; Parkway Place in Huntsville, Alabama,
which was acquired in December  1998 and is  currently  being  redeveloped;  and
Arbor Place Mall in Atlanta  (Douglasville),  Georgia,  which  opened in October
1999.

     On September 25, 2000, the Company entered into a series of agreements with
Jacobs Realty  Investors  Limited  Partnership and certain of its affiliates and
partners  ("Jacobs") pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire from Jacobs
interests  in 21 malls and two  associated  centers for total  consideration  of
approximately  $1.3  billion.  The  transaction  closed  on  January  31,  2001.
Additionally,  in a separate transaction, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
interest in Madison Square Mall in Huntsville,  Alabama.  The purchase price was
comprised of $124.5 million in cash including closing costs of approximately $12
million; the assumption of $745.5 million in non-recourse mortgage debt; and the
issuance of  approximately  12.2  million  special  common  units  (SCUs) in the
Operating  Partnership.  The cash  portion  was funded  from a new $212  million
credit  facility  provided  by a  consortium  of banks led by Wells  Fargo.  The
Company will close on the remainder of the Jacobs  transaction in 2002, at which
time it will assume an additional  $25.7 million of  non-recourse  mortgage debt
and issue an additional 499,733 SCUs.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SALES

     Mall shop sales, for those tenants who have reported,  in the 26 stabilized
malls in the Company's  portfolio,  remained relatively the same on a comparable
per square foot basis as shown below:

     Total sales volume in the mall  portfolio,  including new malls,  increased
1.9% to $1.690 billion in 2000 from $1.659 billion in 1999.

     The weighted average occupancy costs as a percentage of sales for the years
ended  December 31, 2000,  1999 and 1998, for the  stabilized  malls  (excluding
malls  acquired in 1999 and 1998 from those years) were 11.9%,  11.5% and 11.1%,
respectively.

(2)      -        Average base rent over the term of the lease.
</FN>
</TABLE>

     In 2000 and 1999,  revenues  from the malls  represented  77.3% and  76.9%,
respectively, of total revenues from consolidated and unconsolidated properties;
revenues  from  associated  centers  represented  4.1% and 3.7%;  revenues  from
community  centers  represented 17.5% and 17.8%; and revenues from mortgages and
the office building represented 1.1% and 1.6%. Accordingly, revenues and results
of operations are disproportionately impacted by the malls' achievements.

     The  shopping  center  business is somewhat  seasonal in nature with tenant
sales  achieving  the highest  levels during the fourth  quarter  because of the
holiday  season.  The malls earn most of their  "temporary"  rents  (rents  from
short-term  tenants)  during the  holiday  period.  Thus,  occupancy  levels and
revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year.
Results of  operations  realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the
results likely to be experienced over the course of the entire year.


COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS  FOR 2000 TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FOR 1999

     Total  revenues in 2000  increased by $38.9  million,  or 12.2%,  to $356.5
million  compared with $317.6 million in 1999. Of this  increase,  minimum rents
increased by $22.4 million,  or 11.1%,  to $225.5  million  compared with $203.0
million in 1999,  percentage rents increased by $1.4 million,  or 19.1%, to $8.8
million  compared  with $7.4  million in 1999;  other  rents  increased  by $0.8
million,  or 14.8%,  to $6.2 million  compared  with $5.4  million in 1999;  and
tenant  reimbursements  increased by $17.0 million,  or 18.9%, to $106.8 million
compared with $89.8 million in 1999.

     Approximately  $22.3 million of the increase in revenues  resulted from the
ten new centers  opened or acquired  during 1999 and 2000. The centers opened or
acquired  in 1999 and  contributing  to 2000  increases  are Arbor Place Mall in
Atlanta   (Douglasville)   Georgia;  The  Landing  at  Arbor  Place  in  Atlanta
(Douglasville) Georgia; York Galleria, in York,  Pennsylvania;  Sand Lake Corner
in Orlando, Florida; and Fiddler's Run in Morganton,  North Carolina, which were
sold in 2000. The six new centers opened or acquired in 2000 are fully described
in the Developments,  Acquisitions and Expansions  section of the annual report.
Improved  occupancies  and  operations  and  increased  rents  in the  Company's
operating  portfolio  generated  approximately  $21.8  million of the  increased
revenues,  with the largest  increases derived from Rivergate Mall in Nashville,
Tennessee,  and Meridian Mall in Lansing,  Michigan. These increases were offset
by a decrease in revenues of $2.2 million from 13 community centers sold in 2000
and a decrease of $3.1 million in management and development  fees relating to a
one time fee earned in the Company's co-development program in 1999.

     Management, development and leasing fees decreased in 2000 by $3.6 million,
or 46.7%,  to $4.2  million  compared  with $7.8  million  in 1999.  Most of the
decrease  was  due to a  one-time  fees  totaling  $3.1  million  earned  in the
co-development  program  in 1999.  The  balance of the  decrease  was due to the
reduction in continuing co-development fees. Interest and other income increased
in 2000 by $0.9 million, or 21.4%, to $5.1 million compared with $4.2 million in
1999.  This  increase  resulted  primarily  from the ten new  centers  opened or
acquired  over the past 24  months  and  interest  income on the  proceeds  from
community center sales held in escrow during the year.

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                            AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Property  operating  expenses,  including real estate taxes and maintenance
and repairs,  increased in 2000 by $10.7  million,  or 11.1%,  to $106.9 million
compared  with $96.2  million in 1999.  This increase is primarily the result of
the ten new centers  opened or acquired  over the past 24 months.  The Company's
cost recovery ratio,  which includes  redistribution of utilities,  increased to
99.1% in 2000  compared  with 93.3% in 1999 due to increases in occupancy at the
end of 1999 and continued through calendar year 2000.

     Depreciation and amortization  increased in 2000 by $7.1 million, or 13.2%,
to $60.6 million  compared with $53.5  million in 1999.  This increase  resulted
primarily from  depreciation  and  amortization on the ten new centers opened or
acquired  over  the past 24  months  and the  Company's  capital  investment  in
operating properties.

     Interest  expense  increased in 2000 by $12.1 million,  or 14.7%,  to $94.6
million  compared with $82.5 million in 1999.  This increase is primarily due to
increased  interest  expense on the ten new centers  opened or acquired over the
past 24 months offset by reductions in interest expense on debt retired with the
proceeds from the sales of properties.

     General and administrative  expenses increased in 2000 by $1.6 million,  or
9.6%,  to $17.8  million  compared with $16.2 million in 1999. A portion of this
increase  was due to  increases  in general  overhead in  preparation  to assume
management  of The  Richard E.  Jacobs  Group's  interest's  in 21 malls and two
associated centers that were subsequently acquired in January 2001.

     Gain on sales of real estate assets was $16.0 million in 2000 compared with
$8.4 million in 1999. The majority of the gain in 2000 is from the $10.5 million
gain on 13  community  centers sold in 2000.  The centers sold were:  Centerview
Plaza in China Grove,  North Carolina;  Clark's Pond in South  Portland,  Maine;
Dorchester Crossing in Charleston,  South Carolina;  Fiddler's Run in Morganton,
North Carolina; Genesis Square in Crossville,  Tennessee;  Hollins Plantation in
Roanoke,  Virginia; Karns Korner in Knoxville,  Tennessee;  Lakeshore Station in
Gainsville,  Georgia;  Sparta  Crossing  in Sparta,  Tennessee;  Sterling  Creek
Commons in Portsmouth,  Virginia; Tyler Square in Radford, Virginia;  University
Crossing in Pueblo, Colorado; and Wildwood Plaza in Salem, Virginia.  Additional
gains were generated by outparcel and pad sales at two centers under development
in  2000,  Creekwood  Crossing  in  Bradenton,  Florida  and The  Lakes  Mall in
Muskegon,  Michigan, as well as outparcel sales at Sand Lake Corners in Orlando,
Florida, which opened in 1999.


COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS  FOR 1999 TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FOR 1998

     Total  revenues in 1999  increased by $63.0  million,  or 24.7%,  to $317.6
million  compared with $254.6 million in 1998. Of this  increase,  minimum rents
increased by $36.4 million,  or 21.8%,  to $203.0  million  compared with $166.6
million in 1998,  percentage rents increased by $2.6 million,  or 54.8%, to $7.4
million  compared  with $4.8  million in 1998,  other  rents  increased  by $1.4
million,  or 35.8%,  to $5.4 million  compared  with $4.0  million in 1998;  and
tenant  reimbursements  increased by $15.9 million,  or 21.6%,  to $89.8 million
compared with $73.8 million in 1998.

     Approximately  $11.3 million of the increase in revenues  resulted from the
five new  centers  opened or  acquired  during  1999,  and $35.9  million of the
increase in revenues resulted from the ten new centers opened or acquired during
the  past 24  months.  The  centers  opened  in 1998  and  contributing  to 1999
increases are Sterling Creek Commons in Portsmouth, Virginia, and 641,000 square
feet of  expansions.  The  centers  acquired  in 1998 and  contributing  to 1999
increases are Stroud Mall in  Stroudsburg,  Pennsylvania;  Hickory  Hollow Mall,
Rivergate  Mall,  Courtyard at Hickory Hollow,  Village at Rivergate,  and Lions
Head Village, all in Nashville,  Tennessee;  Meridian Mall in Lansing, Michigan;
and  Janesville  Mall in Janesville,  Wisconsin.  The five new centers opened or
acquired in 1999 are Arbor Place Mall in Atlanta  (Douglasville),  Georgia;  The
Landing at Arbor Place in Atlanta (Douglasville),  Georgia; Sand Lake Corners in
Orlando, Florida; and Fiddler's Run in Morganton, North Carolina.  Fiddler's Run
was sold in March 2000 almost a year after it had opened.  Improved  occupancies
and  operations  and  increased  rents  in  the  Company's  operating  portfolio
generated  approximately  $12.4  million  of the  increased  revenues,  with the
largest increases from Hamilton Place in Chattanooga,  Tennessee,  and St. Clair
Square in Fairview  Heights,  Illinois.  New  revenues of $3.4 million were from
one-time fees earned in the Company's co-development program.

     Management, development and leasing fees increased in 1999 by $5.1 million,
or 188.9%,  to $7.8  million  compared  with $2.7  million in 1998.  Most of the
increase  was  due  to  one-time  fees  totaling  $3.4  million  earned  in  the
co-development  program.  The  balance of the  increase  was  provided  from the
Company's  managed  properties and  development  operations.  Interest and other
income  increased in 1999 by $1.5 million,  or 55.0%,  to $4.2 million  compared
with $2.7 million in 1998.  This  increase  resulted  primarily  from the 15 new
centers opened or acquired over the past 24 months.

     Property  operating  expenses,  including real estate taxes and maintenance
and repairs,  increased in 1999 by $16.0  million,  or 20.0%,  to $96.2  million
compared  with $80.2  million in 1998.  This increase is primarily the result of
the 15 new centers  opened or acquired  over the past 24 months.  The  Company's
cost recovery ratio increased to 93.3% in 1999 compared with 92.1% in 1998.

     Depreciation and amortization increased in 1999 by $10.0 million, or 23.0%,
to $53.5 million  compared with $43.5  million in 1998.  This increase  resulted
primarily from  depreciation  and  amortization  on the 15 new centers opened or
acquired over the past 24 months.

     Interest  expense  increased in 1999 by $15.2 million,  or 22.5%,  to $82.5
million  compared with $67.3 million in 1998.  This increase is primarily due to
increased  interest  expense on the 15 new centers  opened or acquired  over the
past 24 months.

     General and administrative  expenses increased in 1999 by $4.4 million,  or
36.9%,  to $16.2 million  compared with $11.8 million in 1998. This increase was
due to increases in state tax expense, payroll, and general overhead.

     Gain on sales of real estate  assets was $8.4 million in 1999 compared with
$4.2 million in 1998. The majority of the gain in 1999 is from outparcel and pad
sales at centers under development in 1999:  Chesterfield  Crossing in Richmond,
Virginia;   Arbor  Place  Mall  and  The  Landing  at  Arbor  Place  in  Atlanta
(Douglasville),  Georgia; and Sand Lake Corners in Orlando, Florida. The gain on
sales in 1999 also includes gain on the sale of two centers, North Park Plaza in
Richmond, Virginia, and a free-standing Regal Cinema in Jacksonville, Florida.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     The principal  uses of the Company's  liquidity and capital  resources have
historically  been  for  property  development,   acquisitions,   expansion  and
renovation programs, and debt repayment. To maintain its qualification as a real
estate  investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code, the Company  currently
is required to distribute to its  shareholders  at least 90% of its "Real Estate
Investment  Trust  Taxable  Income" as defined in the  Internal  Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code").

     As of  December  31,  2000,  the  Company had $93.6  million  available  in
unfunded  construction loans to be used for completion of construction  projects
and   replenishment  of  working  capital   previously  used  for  construction.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2000, the Company had obtained revolving credit
lines  and term  loans  totaling  $240  million,  of  which  $99.0  million  was
available. Also, as a publicly traded company, the Company has access to capital
through both the public equity and debt  markets.  The Company has filed a shelf
registration  statement  authorizing  shares  of  the  Company's  common  stock,
preferred  stock,  and warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock
with an aggregate public offering price of up to $350 million, with $278 million
available as of December 31, 2000. The Company  anticipates that the combination
of these sources will, for the foreseeable future, provide adequate liquidity to
enable it to continue its capital programs substantially as in the past and make
distributions  to its  shareholders in accordance  with the Code's  requirements
applicable to real estate investment trusts.

                            AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Management  expects to refinance the majority of the mortgage notes payable
maturing over the next five years with replacement loans.

     The Company's  capital  structure at December 31, 2000,  included  property
specific mortgages, which are generally non-recourse, revolving lines of credit,
common  stock,  preferred  stock,  and a  minority  interest  in  the  Operating
Partnership.  The minority interest in the Operating Partnership represented the
25.5% ownership interest in the Operating  Partnership held on December 31, 2000
by certain of the Company's  current and former  executive and senior officers .
Additionally,  these current and former  executive  and senior  officers and the
Company's  directors own  approximately  2.0 million  shares of the  outstanding
common  stock of the Company,  for a combined  total  interest in the  Operating
Partnership on December 31, 2000 of  approximately  30.9%.  Ownership  interests
issued to fund  acquisitions in 1998 and 1999 represented on December 31, 2000 a
6.5% interest in the Operating Partnership. Assuming the exchange of all limited
partnership interests in the Operating Partnership for common stock, there would
have been  approximately  36.9 million shares of common stock outstanding with a
market value of approximately  $933.9 million at December 31, 2000 (based on the
closing  price of the  Company's  common stock of $25.3125 per share on December
31, 2000).  The Company's  total market equity is $992.8 million at December 31,
2000,  including  2.9 million  shares of  preferred  stock (based on the closing
price of its  preferred  stock of $20.50 per share on December  31,  2000).  The
Company's current and former executive and senior officers'  ownership interests
had a market value of approximately $288.3 million at December 31, 2000.

     Mortgage debt consists of debt on certain  consolidated  properties as well
as debt on four properties in which the Company owns non-controlling  interests,
accounted for under the equity method of  accounting.  At December 31, 2000, the
Company's share of funded mortgage debt on its consolidated properties (adjusted
for minority  investors'  interests in seven  properties) was $883.2 million and
its pro rata share of mortgage debt on unconsolidated  properties (accounted for
under the equity method) was $42.8 million for total fixed-rate debt obligations
of $926.0 million with a weighted  average  interest rate of 7.5%.  Consolidated
and  unconsolidated  variable-rate  debt  accounted  for $525.6  million  with a
weighted average interest rate of 7.2% (after  application of swap instruments).
Total debt obligations amounted to $1.452 billion.  Variable-rate debt accounted
for  approximately  36.2% of the  Company's  total  debt and  21.5% of its total
capitalization.  Through the  execution of interest  rate swap  agreements,  the
Company has fixed the interest rates on $473.0 million of variable-rate  debt at
a  weighted  average   interest  rate  of  7.1%.  Of  the  Company's   remaining
variable-rate  debt of  $52.6  million,  interest  rate  caps in  place of $50.0
million  leave $2.6  million of debt subject to variable  rates on  construction
properties and no debt subject to variable rates on operating properties.  There
were no fees  charged  to the  Company  related to these  swap  agreements.  The
Company's  interest rate swap and cap  agreements in place at December 31, 2000,
are as follows:

</TABLE>
     Subsequent  to year  end,  the  Company  executed  new  interest  rate swap
agreements  totaling $140 million at a  weighted-average  LIBOR interest rate of
5.051%.

     The outstanding  balance of $146 million on the Company's credit facilities
had a weighted-  average interest rate of 7.7% (before applied swap instruments)
at December 31, 2000.  Each of the credit  facilities  includes  covenants  that
require the Company to maintain minimum net worth levels,  maintain interest and
debt coverage ratios,  maintain total  obligations to capitalized  value ratios,
and maintain  limitations  on  variable-rate  debt. The credit  facilities  also
require  that the  Company's  senior  management  continue to consist of certain
individuals and to

The First Tennessee Bank credit facility  provides that if the Company completes
an offering of its securities, not less than 75% of the net proceeds of any such

</TABLE>
     During  2000  the  Company  closed  permanent  loans of $174  million  at a
weighted average interest rate of 8.24%. The details of those loans are: in June
a $9.9 million loan on Westgate Crossing in Spartanburg,  South Carolina,  at an
interest rate of 8.42%; in July a $5.2 million loan on Plaza Del Sol Mall in Del
Rio,  Texas,  at an interest rate of 9.15% (the Company's share of this loan was
$2.6  million);  in  August  a  $74.5  million  loan  on  Burnsville  Center  in
Burnsville,  Minnesota, at an interest rate of 8.0%; in November a loan of $32.5
million on Stroud Mall in  Stroudsburg,  Pennsylvania,  at an  interest  rate of
8.42%;  and also in  November a $52.0  million  loan on York  Galleria  in York,
Pennsylvania,  at an interest  rate of 8.34%.  The  proceeds of these loans were
used to repay existing  variable rate  indebtedness and to fund  distribution to
equity partners.

     Based on the debt (including construction projects) and the market value of
equity described above, the Company's debt to total market  capitalization (debt
plus market value  equity)  ratio was 59.4% at December  31,  2000,  compared to
63.0% at December 31, 1999.

     On January 31, 2001,  the Company,  assumed in  connection  with the Jacobs
acquisition total debt obligations of $745.5 million,  including  permanent debt
of  $661.5   million   (adjusted  for  minority   interest  in  one   property);
variable-rate debt of $12.5 million;  and its pro rata share of mortgage debt on
unconsolidated  properties  (accounted  for under the  equity  method)  of $71.5
million.  In  addition,  the  Company  closed a $212  million  unsecured  credit
facility  provided by a consortium of banks led by Wells Fargo.  The outstanding
balance  under this  facility  was $115  million at February  28,  2001.  Of the
revolving component of this facility, $97 million is still available and will be
used to fund capital improvements in certain of the acquired properties.

     On January 31, 2001, the Company  acquired Jacobs interests in 21 malls and
two associated  centers.  The total gross leasable area of the 23 properties was
19.2 million  square feet, or an average gross  leasable area of 914,000  square
feet per  mall.  The  gross  leasable  area of the  mall  stores  in the  Jacobs
properties was  approximately  5.9 million square feet. The malls are located in
middle markets predominantly in the Southeast and the Midwest.  Additionaly, the
Company  acquired the remaing 50% interest in Madison Square Mall in Huntsville,
Alabama.

     The Company has also  entered  into a number of option  agreements  for the
development  of future  regional malls and community  centers.  Except for these
projects and as further  described  below,  the Company  currently  has no other
capital commitments.

     It is  management's  expectation  that the  Company  will  continue to have
access to the  capital  resources  necessary  to expand  and grow its  business.
Future development and acquisition  activities will be undertaken by the Company
as  suitable  opportunities  arise.  Such  activities  are  not  expected  to be
undertaken unless adequate sources of financing are available and a satisfactory
budget with targeted returns on investment has been internally approved.

     The Company  will fund its major  development,  expansion  and  acquisition
activity  with its  traditional  sources  of  construction  and  permanent  debt
financing  as well as from other debt and equity  financings,  including  public
financings, and its credit facilities.


OTHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

     Management prepares an annual capital expenditures budget for each property
which is intended to provide for all necessary  recurring  capital  improvements
and maintenance items. Management believes that its annual operating reserve for
maintenance and recurring capital  improvements as well as  reimbursements  from
tenants will provide the necessary  funding for such  requirements.  The Company
intends to distribute approximately 50% to 90% of its funds from operations with
the  remaining 10% to 50% to be held as a reserve for capital  expenditures  and
continued growth opportunities.

     Major  tenant  finish costs for  currently  vacant space are expected to be
funded with working capital,  operating reserves,  or revolving lines of credit.
Funds  invested  for tenant  finish  costs are expected to earn a return on that
investment.

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                            AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2000,   revenue   generating  capital
expenditures,  or tenant allowances for improvements,  were $10.0 million. These
capital  expenditures  generate  a return  through  increased  rents  from these
tenants over the term of their leases.  Revenue enhancing capital  expenditures,
or remodeling and renovation costs, were $7.4 million, the majority of which was
for the renovation of Asheville  Mall in Asheville,  North  Carolina,  and three
community centers. Revenue neutral capital expenditures, such as parking lot and
roof repairs that are recovered from the tenants, were $9.6 million in 2000.

Environmental Matter

     The Company  believes  that the  Properties,  with the exception of Parkway
Place in Huntsville,  Alabama,  are in compliance in all material  respects with
all federal,  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding the handling,
discharge,  and  emission of  hazardous or toxic  substances.  At Parkway  Place
asbestos abatement will occur in portions of the existing mall during demolition
which will be  completed by the end of the second  quarter of 2001.  The Company
has not been notified by any  governmental  authority and is not otherwise aware
of any  material  noncompliance,  liability,  or claim  relating to hazardous or
toxic substances in connection with any of its present or former properties. The
Company has not recorded in its financial  statements any material  liability in
connection with environmental matters.

Cash Flows

     Cash flows  provided by  operating  activities  for 2000  increased by $3.6
million,  or 3.2%, to $117.8 million from $114.2 million in 1999.  This increase
was primarily  due to increases in cash provided from the  operations of ten new
centers  opened or acquired in the last 24 months  offset by  decreases  in cash
flow from the sales of properties.  Cash flows used in investing  activities for
2000  decreased by $85.1  million,  or 40.1%,  to $127.1  million  compared with
$212.1 million in 1999. This decrease was primarily due to the smaller number of
acquisitions  in 2000 compared  with the number of  acquisitions  in 1999.  Cash
flows provided by financing  activities for 2000 decreased by $91.8 million,  or
92.6%,  to $7.4 million from $99.2  million in 1999.  This decrease is primarily
due  to  decreased  borrowings  related  to  the  acquisition  program  and  the
retirement of debt with proceeds from sales of the properties.

Impact of Inflation

     In the last three years,  inflation has not had a significant impact on the
Company because of the relatively low inflation rate.  Substantially  all tenant
leases do, however,  contain provisions designed to protect the Company from the
impact of inflation.  Such provisions  include  clauses  enabling the Company to
receive  percentage  rentals  based on tenants'  gross  sales,  which  generally
increase as prices rise, and/or  escalation  clauses,  which generally  increase
rental rates during the terms of the leases. In addition, many of the leases are
for  terms of less than ten  years  which may  enable  the  Company  to  replace
existing  leases  with new leases at higher base  and/or  percentage  rentals if
rents from the existing leases are below the then-existing  market rate. Most of
the  leases  require  the  tenants  to pay their  share of  operating  expenses,
including  common area  maintenance,  real estate taxes and  insurance,  thereby
reducing the  Company's  exposure to increases in costs and  operating  expenses
resulting from inflation.

New Accounting Pronouncements

     Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as amended, ("SFAS No. 133")
establishes  accounting and reporting  standards requiring that every derivative
instrument   (including  certain  derivative   instruments   embedded  in  other
contracts)  be  recorded in the  balance  sheet as either an asset or  liability
measured  at  its  fair  value.  SFAS  No.  133  requires  that  changes  in the
derivative's  fair value be  recognized  currently in earnings  unless  specific
hedge  accounting  criteria are met.  Special  accounting for qualifying  hedges
allows a derivative's  gains and losses to offset related  results on the hedged
item  in the  income  statement;  and  requires  that a  company  must  formally
document,  designate,  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive
hedge accounting.

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                            AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The Company has  determined  that a portion of its  derivative  instruments
(swap agreements and an interest rate cap agreement) in place are ineffective as
defined by SFAS No. 133. The terms of ineffective  derivative instruments expire
in 2001,  thus while the Company may experience  some  volatility in earnings in
interim  periods,  there will be no effect to current  earnings in the Company's
financial  statements  for the year ended  December 31, 2001. If the Company had
implemented  SFAS  No.  133 as of  December  31,  2000,  ineffective  derivative
instruments  would  have  increased  total  assets by  $514,000  and would  have
increased net income by $514,000.  Effective  derivative  instruments would have
increased liabilities by $262,000 and comprehensive income, also recorded on the
balance sheet, would have decreased by $262,000.

Funds from Operations

     Management   believes  that  Funds  from  Operations  ("FFO")  provides  an
additional  indicator of the financial  performance  of the  Properties.  FFO is
defined by the Company as net income (loss) before  depreciation  of real estate
assets,  gains or  losses  on sales  of real  estate  and  gains  or  losses  on
investments in marketable  securities.  FFO also includes the Company's share of
FFO in unconsolidated  properties and excludes minority  interests' share of FFO
in consolidated  properties  other than the Operating  Partnership.  The Company
computes  FFO in  accordance  with  the  National  Association  of  Real  Estate
Investment  Trusts  ("NAREIT")   recommendation  concerning  finance  costs  and
non-real estate depreciation.  The Company excludes gains or losses on outparcel
sales, even though NAREIT permits their inclusion when calculating FFO. Gains or
losses on outparcel  sales would have added to FFO $5.4 million in 2000 compared
with $8.4 million in 1999.

     The use of FFO as an indicator of financial  performance  is influenced not
only by the operations of the Properties,  but also by the capital  structure of
the Operating Partnership and the Company. Accordingly,  management expects that
FFO will be one of the significant  factors considered by the Board of Directors
in determining the amount of cash  distributions the Operating  Partnership will
make to its partners (including the Company).  Management also believes that FFO
is a widely used measure of the  operating  performance  of REITs and provides a
relevant basis for comparison among companies.  FFO does not represent cash flow
from operations as defined by accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
United States  ("GAAP"),  is not necessarily  indicative of cash from operations
available  to fund all cash flow  needs,  and  should  not be  considered  as an
alternative  to net income for purposes of evaluating  the  Company's  operating
performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

     Effective  January 1, 2000,  NAREIT  clarified FFO to include all operating
results  -  recurring  and  non-recurring  - except  those  results  defined  as
"extraordinary  items" under  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
United States.  The Company  implemented this clarification in the first quarter
of 2000 and no longer adds back to FFO development  costs charged to net income.
This amount was $127,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000.  For  comparatice
purposes, the Company has recomputed its 1999 FFO herein to exclude the add-back
of development costs charged to net income of $1,674,000.

     In 2000,  FFO  increased  by $15.8  million,  or 13.6%,  to $132.0  million
compared  with  $116.3  million  in  1999.  The  increase  in FFO was  primarily
attributable  to the continuing  increase in revenues and income from operations
from ten new  developments and  acquisitions,  and increases in occupancy levels
and higher rents in the Company's  stabilized  portfolio offset by FFO decreases
from the sales of thirteen properties.

ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The Company has  managed  the market risk for its  variable  rate debt with
derivative financial  instruments.  The derivative  instruments are described in
the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7 above and in Note 8 to the
Financial Statements.

     The fair  value of the  Company's  long  term  debt is  estimated  based on
discounted  cash flows at interest rates that management  believes  reflects the
risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration.

                      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



To the Board of Directors of CBL & Associates Properties, Inc.:

     We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of CBL &
ASSOCIATES  PROPERTIES,  INC. (a Delaware  corporation)  and  subsidiaries as of
December  31,  2000  and  1999,  and  the  related  consolidated  statements  of
operations,  shareholders'  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the  period  ended  December  31,  2000.  These  financial  statements  are  the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of CBL & Associates Properties,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the United States.

     Our audit was made for the  purpose  of  forming  an  opinion  on the basic
financial  statements  taken as a whole.  The  schedules  listed in the index to
financial  statements  are  presented  for the  purpose  of  complying  with the
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission's  rules  and  are not  part of the  basic
financial  statements.  These  schedules  have been  subjected  to the  auditing
procedures  applied in the audit of the basic  financial  statements and, in our
opinion, fairly state in all material respects the financial data required to be
set forth  therein in  relation  to the basic  financial  statements  taken as a
whole.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.       ORGANIZATION

     CBL & Associates Properties,  Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation,
is engaged in the development,  acquisition,  and operation of regional shopping
malls and community  centers,  primarily in the Southeast and select  markets in
the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States.  The Company is the 100%
owner of two qualified REIT subsidiaries,  CBL Holdings I, Inc. and CBL Holdings
II, Inc.,  which are the sole general partner and majority owner,  respectively,
of CBL & Associates  Limited  Partnership  (the "Operating  Partnership").  As a
result,  the Company  conducts its business  through the Operating  Partnership,
which at December  31,  2000,  owns  controlling  interests  in a  portfolio  of
properties consisting of 26 regional malls; 15 associated centers, each of which
is part of a regional  shopping mall complex;  two power  centers;  70 community
centers; and one office building.  Additionally,  the Operating Partnership owns
non-controlling  interests in four regional malls and one associated center. The
Operating  Partnership  has two malls and one community  center  currently under
construction and has options to acquire certain development  properties owned by
third  parties.  At December 31, 2000, CBL Holdings I, Inc. owned a 2.5% general
partnership interest and CBL Holdings II, Inc. owned a 65.4% limited partnership
interest  in the  Operating  Partnership  for a  combined  interest  held by the
Company of 67.9%.

     The minority interest in the Operating Partnership is held primarily by CBL
& Associates, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively "CBL") who contributed their
interests in certain real estate  properties and joint ventures to the Operating
Partnership in exchange for a limited  partnership  interest in connection  with
the formation of the  Operating  Partnership  in November  1993. At December 31,
2000, CBL owns a 25.5% limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership
(Note 10).

     To comply with certain technical  requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the  "Code"),  the  Operating  Partnership  carries out the
Company's  property   management  and  development   activities  through  CBL  &
Associates   Management,   Inc.  (the  "Management   Company").   The  Operating
Partnership  holds 100% of the preferred stock and 5% of the common stock of the
Management  Company,  with CBL holding the  remaining  95% of the common  stock.
Through the ownership of the preferred stock, the Operating Partnership receives
substantially all of the cash flow and, therefore,  enjoys  substantially all of
the  economic  benefits  of  the  Management  Company's  operations.  Due to the
Company's ability, as sole general partner, to control the Operating Partnership
and the  Operating  Partnership's  rights to  substantially  all of the economic
benefits of the Management Company,  the accounts of each entity are included in
the accompanying  consolidated financial statements.  The Company, the Operating
Partnership,  and the  Management  Company are referred to  collectively  as the
"Company".

     All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in the consolidated presentation.

     On  January  31,  2001,  the  Company  completed  the  first  stage  of the
acquisition  of The  Richard E.  Jacobs  Group's  interests  in 21 malls and two
associated  centers for total  consideration  of  approximately  $1.26  billion,
including  the  acquisition  of minority  interests in certain  properties.  The
purchase price is comprised of $124.5 million in cash including closing costs of
approximately  $12 million;  the  assumption of  $745.5million  in  non-recourse
mortgage  debt;  and the  issuance of  12,056,692  special  common  units of the
Operating  Partnership  with a face value of $32.25 per unit and a fair value of
$27.25 per unit.  The cash portion was funded from a new $212 million  unsecured
credit  facility  provided  by a  consortium  of banks led by Wells  Fargo.  The
Company  will close on the second  stage in 2002,  which will consist of cash of
$0.3 million, the assumption of $25.7 million in non-recourse mortgage debt, and
the issuance of 499,733 special common units of the Operating Partnership with a
face value of $32.25 per unit. In a separate transaction,  the Company issued an
additional 603,344 special common units of the Operating Partnership to purchase
the remaining 50% interest in Madison Square Mall in Huntsville, Alabama.


2.       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Real Estate Assets

     Costs directly related to the development of real estate assets,  including
overhead costs directly attributable to property  development,  are capitalized.
Interest costs  incurred  during the  development  and  construction  period are
capitalized.

                                       64

                        CBL & ASSOCIATS PROPERTIES, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     Ordinary   repairs  and  maintenance   are  expensed  as  incurred.   Major
replacements  and  improvements  are  capitalized  and  depreciated  over  their
estimated  useful  lives.  Depreciation  is  computed on a  straight-line  basis
generally  over 40 years for buildings and  improvements  and seven to ten years
for equipment and fixtures.  Tenant improvements are capitalized and depreciated
on a straight-line basis over the life of the related lease.

Long-Lived Assets

     The Company periodically  evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets
to be held and used when  events or  changes  in  circumstances  warrant  such a
review. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the
projected  undiscounted future cash flow of such asset is less than its carrying
value.  Management  believes that no material impairment existed at December 31,
2000, and accordingly, no loss was recognized.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Cash and cash equivalents include all cash and cash equivalent  investments
with original maturities of three months or less, primarily consisting of demand
deposits in banks.

Deferred Financing Costs

     Deferred  financing costs are included in other assets in the  accompanying
consolidated balance sheets, include fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term
financing,  and are being  amortized over the terms of the  respective  mortgage
notes  payable.  Unamortized  deferred  financing  costs  are  written  off when
mortgage notes payable are retired before the maturity date.

Deferred Transaction Costs

     Deferred  transaction costs of $5.4 million are included in other assets in
the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheet at December 31, 2000, and include
fees and costs  incurred in connection  with the  acquisition  of The Richard E.
Jacobs  Group's  interests in 21 malls and two associated  centers.  These costs
will be capitalized as part of the value assigned to these assets.

Revenue Recognition

     Rental  revenue  attributable  to  operating  leases  is  recognized  on  a
straight-line basis over the initial term of the related leases. Certain tenants
are required to pay additional rent if sales volume exceeds  specified  amounts.
The Company  recognizes this additional rent as revenue when such amounts become
determinable.  A substantial  portion of the Company's  rental income is derived
from various national and regional retail companies.

Tenant Reimbursements

     The Company  receives  reimbursements  from  tenants  for certain  costs as
provided  in the lease  agreements.  These costs  consist of real estate  taxes,
common area maintenance,  and other recoverable costs. Tenant reimbursements are
recognized as revenue in the period the costs are incurred.

Management, Development and Leasing Fees

     Management  fees are charged as a percentage of rentals and are  recognized
as revenue as they are  earned.  Leasing  fees are  charged  for newly  executed
leases.  These fees are  recognized as revenues as they are earned.  Development
fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the development period.

Gain on Sales of Real Estate Assets

     Gain on sales of real estate  assets is recognized at the time title to the
asset is  transferred  to the buyer,  subject  to the  adequacy  of the  buyer's
initial and continuing  investment and the assumption by the buyer of all future
ownership risks of the asset.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Income Taxes

     The Company is qualified as a real estate  investment  trust under Sections
856 through 860 of the Code and  applicable  treasury  regulations.  In order to
maintain  qualification  as a real  estate  investment  trust,  the  Company  is
currently  required  to  distribute  at  least  90% of  its  taxable  income  to
shareholders  and meet  certain  other  asset and income  tests as well as other
requirements.  As a real estate investment trust, the Company will generally not
be liable for federal  corporate  income  taxes.  Thus, no provision for federal
income  taxes  has been  included  in the  accompanying  consolidated  financial
statements. If the Company fails to qualify as a real estate investment trust in
any  taxable  year,  the  Company  will be subject to federal  income tax on its
taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if the Company maintains its
qualification for taxation as a real estate investment trust, the Company may be
subject to certain  state and local  taxes on its  income and  property,  and to
federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed  income. State income taxes
were not significant in 2000, 1999 and 1998.


Derivative Financial Instruments

     Interest rate cap and swap  agreements,  which are principally  used by the
Company in the  management  of interest rate  exposure,  are accounted for on an
accrual  basis.  Amounts to be paid or received under interest rate cap and swap
agreements are recorded in interest  expense in the period in which they accrue.
See Note 8 for additional information.

Concentration of Credit Risk

     The Company's  tenants consist of national,  regional and local  retailers.
Financial instruments which subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk
consist  primarily  of tenant  leases.  The Company  does not  generally  obtain
collateral or other security to support financial  instruments subject to credit
risk but monitors the credit standing of tenants.

Earnings Per Share

     Basic  earnings  per share  ("EPS")  excludes  dilution  and is computed by
dividing  earnings  available  to common  shareholders  by the  weighted-average
number of unrestricted  common shares  outstanding  for the period.  Diluted EPS
assumes the issuance of common stock for all  potential  dilutive  common shares
outstanding.  The limited partners' rights to convert their minority interest in
the  Operating  Partnership  into shares of common stock are not dilutive  (Note
10). The  difference in basic and diluted EPS is due to the assumed  exercise of
outstanding stock options and restricted stock resulting in 140,000, 187,000 and
261,000  additional  potential  dilutive  common shares in 2000,  1999 and 1998,
respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

     The  Company  accounts  for  its  stock-based   compensation   plans  under
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to
Employees"  (APB No. 25).  Effective in 1996, the Company adopted the disclosure
option  of  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS")  No.  123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation." SFAS No. 123 requires companies that
do not choose to account  for  stock-based  compensation  as  prescribed  by the
statement to disclose the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share
as if SFAS No. 123 had been adopted. Additionally, certain other disclosures are
required with respect to stock-based  compensation  and the assumptions  used to
determine  the pro forma  effects of SFAS No. 123.  See Note 12 for the required
disclosures.

Use of Estimates

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in conformity  with  accounting
principles  generally accepted in the United States requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements,  and the  reported  amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

interest at variable  interest rates indexed to the prime lending rate or London
Interbank  Offered  Rate  ("LIBOR")  (7.56%  to 9.50%  at  December  31,  2000).
Permanent loans mature at various dates from 2001 through 2016.

Construction Loans

     At  December  31,  2000,  the  Company  had  construction  loans  on  seven

7.      SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

     In June 1998, the Company  completed a public offering of 2,875,000  shares
of 9% Series A Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Stock (the "Series A Preferred
Stock") at a price to the public of $25.00 per share,  including  715,875 shares
purchased by an affiliate of Wells Fargo Bank. The net proceeds of $69.8 million
were  used  to  repay  variable-rate  indebtedness  incurred  in  the  Company's
development  and acquisition  programs.  The dividends on the Series A Preferred
Stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of issue and are payable quarterly
in arrears  commencing  on September  30, 1998, at a rate of $2.25 per share per
annum.  The Series A Preferred Stock has no stated  maturity,  is not subject to
any sinking fund or mandatory  redemption and is not redeemable prior to July 1,
2003.  On or after July 1, 2003,  the  Company may redeem the Series A Preferred
Stock,  in whole or in part, at any time for a cash  redemption  price of $25.00
per share, plus dividends accrued and unpaid.


8.      DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The  Company  has  only  limited  involvement  with  derivative   financial
instruments and does not use them for trading purposes.  They are used to manage
well defined interest rate risks.

     Under interest rate swap agreements,  the Company agrees with other parties
to exchange,  at specified  intervals,  the  difference  between  fixed rate and
variable  rate  interest  amounts  calculated  by  reference  to an  agreed-upon
notional amount. Under these agreements,  the Company receives interest payments
at a rate equal to LIBOR (6.56% at December 31, 2000) and pays interest at fixed
rates shown below.

</TABLE>

     The  Company has a $50 million  interest  rate cap on LIBOR based  variable
rate debt at 7.5%  terminating  October 1, 2001. The Company also obtained a $50
million  interest  rate swap with a fixed LIBOR  component  of 5.737%  effective
January 3, 2001, and expiring June 1, 2002.

     The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of  nonperformance  by
the   counterparties   to  its  interest  rate  swap  and  cap   agreements  and
nonderivative  financial  assets but has no  off-balance  sheet  credit  risk of
accounting loss. The Company anticipates,  however,  that counterparties will be
able to fully satisfy their  obligations  under the contracts.  The Company does
not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject
to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of counterparties.

     Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 133,  "Accounting  for
Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities",  as amended,  ("SFAS No. 133")
establishes  accounting and reporting  standards requiring that every derivative
instrument   (including  certain  derivative   instruments   embedded  in  other
contracts)  be  recorded in the  balance  sheet as either an asset or  liability
measured  at  its  fair  value.  SFAS  No.  133  requires  that  changes  in the
derivative's  fair value be  recognized  currently in earnings  unless  specific
hedge  accounting  criteria are met.  Special  accounting for qualifying  hedges
allows a derivative's  gains and losses to offset related  results on the hedged
item in the income statement and requires that a company must formally document,
designate,  and assess the  effectiveness  of  transactions  that receive  hedge
accounting.

     The Company will  implement SFAS No.133  beginning  January 1, 2001, and it
will  recognize  as  separate  assets and  liabilities  only  those  derivatives
embedded in hybrid instruments issued,  acquired,  or substantively  modified by
the entity on or after the selected transition date.

     The Company has  determined  that a portion of its  derivative  instruments
(swap agreements and an interest rate cap agreement) in place are ineffective as
defined by SFAS No. 133. The terms of ineffective  derivative instruments expire
in 2001;  thus,  while the Company may experience some volatility in earnings in
interim  periods,  there will be no effect to current  earnings in the Company's
financial  statements  for the year ended  December 31, 2001. If the Company had
implemented  SFAS  No.  133 as of  December  31,  2000,  ineffective  derivative
instruments  would  have  increased  total  assets by  $514,000  and would  have
increased net income by $514,000.  Effective  derivative  instruments would have
increased liabilities by $262,000 and comprehensive income, also recorded on the
balance sheet, would have decreased by $262,000.

9.      FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The carrying  values of cash and cash  equivalents,  receivables,  accounts
payable,  and accrued liabilities are reasonable  estimates of their fair values
because  of the short  maturity  of these  financial  instruments.  Based on the
interest rates for similar financial instruments, the carrying value of mortgage
notes receivable is a reasonable estimation of fair value. The carrying value of
mortgage and other notes payable,  based on borrowing rates currently  available
to the Company,  is a reasonable  estimation  of fair value at December 31, 2000
and 1999.  The fair value of the interest  rate swap and cap  agreements,  which
represents the cash  requirement if the existing  agreements had been settled at
year end, was not significant at December 31, 2000 and 1999.

10.     CONVERSION RIGHTS

     Pursuant to the Operating Partnership agreement,  the limited partners were
granted  rights  to  convert  their  partnership   interests  in  the  Operating
Partnership into shares of common stock,  subject to certain limits, and to sell
to the Company after November 3, 1996, part or all of their partnership interest
in the  Operating  Partnership  in exchange  for shares of common stock or their
cash equivalent at the Company's election, as defined.

     The  Operating  Partnership  acquired  properties  from CBL in exchange for
1,336 and 63,904 limited  partnership units in the Operating  Partnership during
2000 and 1998,  respectively.  In October 1999 the Company issued 79,715 limited
partnership  units valued at  $1,928,000  to a third party in exchange for land.
During 1998, the Operating  Partnership  issued  2,749,888  limited  partnership
units in the Operating  Partnership  valued at $68.3 million to third parties in
exchange for seven properties.

     In November 2000, the Company purchased 34,463 limited  partnerships  units
valued at $761,000  from a third  party.  In July 1998,  the  Company  purchased
122,008 limited partnership units valued at $3.0 million from a former executive
and minority  investor in the Operating  Partnership.  Also during 1998, a third
party converted 388,022 limited partnership units to common stock.

     At December 31, 2000 and 1999, there remained outstanding rights to convert
CBL's minority interest in the Operating  Partnership to 9,419,088 and 9,417,752
shares of common  stock,  respectively.  At December  31,  2000 and 1999,  there
remained  outstanding rights to convert third parties' minority interests in the
Operating  Partnership  to  2,407,000  and  2,442,000  shares of  common  stock,
respectively.

11.     401(K) PROFIT SHARING PLAN

     The Management  Company  maintains a 401(k) profit  sharing plan,  which is
qualified under Section 401(a) and Section 401(k) of the Code to cover employees
of the  Management  Company.  All  employees who have attained the age of 21 and
have  completed at least one year of service are eligible to  participate in the
plan. The plan provides for employer  matching  contributions  on behalf of each
participant equal to 50% of the portion of such participant's contribution which
does not  exceed  2.5% of such  participant's  compensation  for the plan  year.
Additionally,  the  Management  Company has the  discretion  to make  additional
profit-sharing-type   contributions   not   related  to   participant   elective
contributions.   Total   contributions  by  the  Management   Company  were  not
significant for 2000, 1999, and 1998.

12.     STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

     The Company  maintains  the CBL & Associates  Properties,  Inc.  1993 Stock
Incentive  Plan,  as amended  (the "Plan")  which  permits the issuance of stock
options and common stock to selected  officers,  employees  and directors of the
Company, up to 2,800,000 shares of common stock. The Plan is administered by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee").

     Stock options  issued under the Plan allow for the purchase of common stock
at the fair  market  value of the  stock at the  date of  grant.  Stock  options
granted to officers and employees under the Plan vest and become  exercisable in
installments  on each of the first five  anniversaries  of the date of grant and
expire ten years after the date of grant. Stock options granted to directors are
fully vested upon grant, but may not be sold,  pledged or otherwise  transferred
in any manner during the director's term or for one year thereafter.

     The Company accounts for its stock-based  compensation  plans under APB No.
25, under which no  compensation  expense has been  recognized for stock options
granted as all employee  options have been granted with an exercise  price equal
to the fair value of the Company's  common stock on the date of grant.  For SFAS
No.  123  purposes,  the  fair  value of each  employee  option  grant  has been
estimated as of the date of grant using the  Black-Sholes  option  pricing model
and the  following  weighted  average  assumptions  for  2000,  1999  and  1998,
respectively:

     Using  these  assumptions,  the fair value of the  employee  stock  options
granted in 2000, 1999 and 1998 is $500,000, $468,000 and $468,000, respectively,
which would be amortized as compensation  expense over the vesting period of the
options.  Had compensation  cost for the plan been determined in accordance with

outstanding  at December 31, 2000,  1,284,067 are currently  exercisable  with a
weighted-average exercise price of $21.47 per share.

     Under the Plan,  common stock may be awarded either alone,  in addition to,
or in tandem with other stock awards  granted under the Plan.  The Committee has
the  authority  to  determine  eligible  persons  to whom  common  stock will be
awarded,  the number of shares to be  awarded,  and the  duration of the vesting
period, as defined.

     During 2000,  the Company  issued  72,329  shares of common stock under the
Plan with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $22.59 per share, of which
36,606 shares of common stock were  immediately  vested.  The  remaining  35,723
shares of common stock vest at various dates from 2001 to 2005.

     During 1999,  the Company  issued  38,989  shares of common stock under the

13.        RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     CBL  and  certain  officers  of the  Company  have a  significant  minority
interest in the construction company that has been engaged by the Company in the
building of substantially all of the Company's properties.

     The  Management  Company  provides   management  and  leasing  services  to
affiliated  partnerships  and joint  ventures  not  controlled  by the  Company.
Revenue  recognized  for these services  amounted to $1,166,000,  $1,086,000 and
$1,034,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

14.        COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     The  Company is  currently  involved in certain  litigation  arising in the
ordinary  course  of  business.  In  the  opinion  of  management,  the  pending
litigation will not materially  affect the financial  statements of the Company.
Additionally,  based  on  environmental  studies  completed  to date on the real
estate properties, management believes exposure related to environmental cleanup
will be  immaterial  to the  consolidated  financial  position and  consolidated
results of operations of the Company.

     The Company has entered into standby  purchase  agreements with third-party
developers (the  "Developers") for the  construction,  development and potential
ownership of two community centers in Texas (the "Co-Development Projects"). The
Developers  have  utilized  these  standby  purchase  agreements  to  assist  in
obtaining financing to fund the construction of the Co-Development Projects. The
standby  purchase  agreements,  which expire in 2001, are dependent upon certain
completion  requirements,  rental  levels,  the  inability of the  Developers to
obtain   adequate   permanent   financing,   and  the   inability  to  sell  the
Co-Development Project before the Company has to fund its equity contribution or
purchase the Co-Development  Project. In return for its commitment to purchase a
Co-Development  Project  pursuant to a standby purchase  agreement,  the Company
receives  a fee as  well as a  participation  interest  in  each  Co-Development
Project.  The outstanding amount of standby purchase  agreements at December 31,
2000, is $51.4 million.

16.        SEGMENT INFORMATION

     Management of the Company  measures  performance  and  allocates  resources
according to property type,  which are determined  based on differences  such as
nature of tenants, capital requirements, economic risks, and leasing terms. Rent
income and tenant  reimbursements  from tenant  leases  provide the  majority of
revenues from all segments.  Information on management's  reportable segments is
