CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF
THE "SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF
1995


     Certain  statements made in this section or elsewhere in this report may be
deemed "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities
laws.   Although  the  Company  believes  the  expectations   reflected  in  any
forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions,  the Company can
give no assurance that these  expectations will be attained,  and it is possible
that  actual  results  may  differ  materially  from  those  indicated  by these
forward-looking  statements  due to a variety of risks and  uncertainties.  Such
risks and uncertainties include, without limitation,  general industry, economic
and  business  conditions,  interest  rate  fluctuations,  costs of capital  and
capital  requirements,  availability  of real estate  properties,  inability  to
consummate  acquisition  opportunities,  competition  from other  companies  and
retail formats,  changes in retail rental rates in the Company's markets, shifts
in customer demands,  tenant bankruptcies or store closings,  changes in vacancy
rates at the Company's  properties,  changes in operating  expenses,  changes in
applicable laws,  rules and  regulations,  the ability to obtain suitable equity
and/or debt financing and the continued availability of financing in the amounts
and on the terms necessary to support the Company's future business. The Company
disclaims any obligation to update or revise any  forward-looking  statements to
reflect actual results or changes in the factors  affecting the  forward-looking
information.


                                  Part I.
ITEM 1. BUSINESS

History of the Company

     CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. (the "Company") was organized on July 13,
1993, as a Delaware corporation, to acquire substantially all of the real estate
properties  owned  by  CBL  &  Associates,  Inc.,  and  its  affiliates  ("CBL's
Predecessor"),  which was formed by Charles B.  Lebovitz in 1978. On November 3,
1993,  the Company  completed an initial  public  offering (the  "Offering")  of
15,400,000  shares of its common stock (the "Common Stock").  Simultaneous  with
the completion of the Offering, CBL's Predecessor transferred  substantially all
of its  interests  in its real estate  properties  to CBL &  Associates  Limited
Partnership  (the  "Operating  Partnership")  in  exchange  for common  units of
limited  partnership  interest in the Operating  Partnership.  CBL's Predecessor
also acquired an additional  interest in the  Operating  Partnership  for a cash
payment.  The interests in the Operating  Partnership contain certain conversion
rights that are more fully  described  in Note 9 to the  consolidated  financial
statements.

     *    In June 1998,  the Company  completed a public  offering of  2,875,000
          shares of 9.0% Series A  Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Stock at a
          face value of $25.00 per share. The net proceeds of $70.0 million were
          used to repay  variable-rate  indebtedness  incurred in the  Company's
          development and acquisition programs.

     *    In  January  2001,  the  Company  completed  the  first  stage  of its
          acquisition  of  The  Richard  E.  Jacobs  Group,   Inc.'s  ("Jacobs")
          interests   in  21  malls  and  two   associated   centers  for  total
          consideration  of $1.2 billion.  The purchase  price  consisted of the
          issuance  of  12,056,692   special   common  units  of  the  Operating
          Partnership  with a fair value of $27.25 per unit,  the  assumption of
          $750.2 million of mortgage debt and $125.5 million of cash.

     *    In March 2002, the Company completed the second and final stage of its
          acquisition of Jacobs'  interests.  The total  consideration  of $42.5
          million  included the issuance of 499,730  special common units of the
          Operating  Partnership  with a fair  value of  $35.24  per  unit,  the
          assumption of $24.5 million of fixed rate  non-recourse  debt and $0.4
          million of cash. Ownership interests acquired included: a 31% interest
          in Columbia  Place,  Columbia,  SC; a 17% interest in East Towne Mall,
          West Towne  Mall and West  Towne  Crossing  in  Madison,  WI; and a 2%
          interest in Kentucky Oaks Mall in Paducah, KY.

                                       3

     *    In January 2001, the Company  issued  602,980  special common units of
          the  Operating  Partnership  valued at $16.4 million and 31,008 common
          units of the Operating  Partnership valued at $0.9 million to purchase
          the remaining 50% and 25% interests in Madison Square Mall and Madison
          Plaza in Huntsville, AL, respectively.

     *    In March 2002, the Company completed a follow-on offering of 3,352,770
          shares of its Common  Stock.  The net proceeds of $114.7  million were
          used to repay  outstanding  borrowings  under the  Company's  lines of
          credit and to retire term loans on several properties.

     *    In June 2002,  the Company  completed a public  offering of  2,000,000
          shares of 8.75% Series B Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Stock at a
          face value of $50.00 per share.  The net  proceeds  were used to repay
          outstanding  borrowings  under the  Company's  lines of credit  and to
          retire term loans on several properties.

     *    In May 2002, the Company acquired Panama City Mall,  located in Panama
          City, FL, for a purchase  price of $45.7  million.  The purchase price
          consisted of the assumption of $40.7 million of non-recourse  mortgage
          debt with an interest  rate of 7.30%,  the issuance of 118,695  common
          units of the Operating  Partnership  with a fair value of $4.5 million
          ($37.80 per unit) and $0.5 million in cash closing costs.

     *    In August 2002,  the Company  acquired  the  remaining  21%  ownership
          interest in Columbia Place.  The total  consideration  of $9.9 million
          consisted of the issuance of 61,662  common units with a fair value of
          $2.3 million  ($36.97 per unit) and the  assumption of $7.6 million of
          debt.

     *    In December 2002,  the Company  acquired the remaining 35% interest in
          East Towne Mall, West Towne Mall and West Towne Crossing. The purchase
          price  consisted of the  issuance of 932,669  common units with a fair
          value of $36.4 million  ($39.04 per unit) and the  assumption of $25.6
          million of debt.

The Company's Business

     The Company is a  self-managed,  self-administered,  fully  integrated real
estate   investment   trust  ("REIT")  that  is  engaged  in  the   development,
acquisition, and operation of regional shopping malls and community centers. The
Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal  income tax  purposes.  As
one of the largest mall REITs in the United  States,  the Company owns interests
in properties  primarily in middle market communities in the Southeast,  as well
as in select markets in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States.

     The  Company  conducts  substantially  all  of  its  business  through  the
Operating  Partnership.  The  Company  is the 100% owner of two  qualified  REIT
subsidiaries,  CBL  Holdings I, Inc.  and CBL  Holdings II, Inc. CBL Holdings I,
Inc. is the sole general partner of the Operating  Partnership.  At December 31,
2002,  CBL Holdings I, Inc.  owned a 1.7% general  partnership  interest and CBL
Holdings II, Inc.  owned a 52.0% limited  partnership  interest in the Operating
Partnership, for a combined interest held by the Company of 53.7%.

As of December 31, 2002, the Company owns:

     *    interests in a portfolio of operating properties including 55 enclosed
          regional malls (the "Malls"),  20 associated  centers (the "Associated
          Centers"),  63 community  centers  (the  "Community  Centers")  and an
          office building (the "Office Building");
                                       4
<PAGE>


     *    interests  in one  regional  mall,  one  associated  center  and three
          community   centers  that  are  currently  under   construction   (the
          "Construction  Properties"),  as well as options  to  acquire  certain
          shopping center development sites; and

     *    mortgages (the "Mortgages") on 11 properties that are secured by first
          mortgages or wrap-around  mortgages on the underlying  real estate and
          related improvements.

     The Malls, Associated Centers, Community Centers,  Construction Properties,
Mortgages and Office Building are  collectively  referred to as the "Properties"
and individually as a "Property".

     The Operating  Partnership  conducts the Company's property  management and
development   activities  through  CBL  &  Associates   Management,   Inc.  (the
"Management  Company").  The Operating  Partnership  holds 100% of the preferred
stock  and  owns  6% of the  common  stock  of  the  Management  Company.  CBL's
Predecessor  holds the remaining 94% of the Management  Company's  common stock.
Through its ownership of the preferred stock, the Operating Partnership receives
substantially all of the cash flow and enjoys  substantially all of the economic
benefits of the Management Company's operations.

     The Management  Company manages all of the Properties except for Governor's
Square and  Governor's  Plaza in  Clarksville,  TN and  Kentucky  Oaks Mall,  in
Paducah, KY. A property manager affiliated with the non-Company managing general
partner  performs the property  management  services  for these  Properties  and
receives  a fee  for its  services.  The  managing  partner  of  each  of  these
Properties controls the cash flow distributions, although the Company's approval
is required for certain major decisions.

     The  Properties'  derive most of their income from rents  received  through
operating leases with retail tenants.  These operating leases require tenants to
pay minimum rent, which is often subject to scheduled  increases  throughout the
term of the lease.  Certain tenants are required to pay percentage rent if their
sales  volumes   exceed   thresholds   specified  in  their  lease   agreements.
Additionally,   tenant  leases  generally  provide  that  the  Company  will  be
reimbursed for common area  maintenance,  real state taxes,  insurance and other
operating expenses incurred in the day-to day operation of the Properties.

     The  following  terms used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will have the
meanings described below:

     *    GLA - refers to gross  leasable  area of retail  space in square feet,
          including anchors and mall tenants

     *    Anchor - refers to a department store or other large retail store

     *    Freestanding - property locations that are not attached to the primary
          complex of buildings that comprise the mall shopping center

     *    Outparcel - land used for freestanding developments, such as banks and
          restaurants, on the periphery of the Properties

Environmental Matters

     Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of
the  environment  may  require a current or  previous  owner or operator of real
property to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic  substances or petroleum
product  releases at the property,  without the current owner or operator having
knowledge of the presence of the  contaminants.  If  unidentified  environmental
problems arise at one of the Company's  Properties,  substantial payments may be
required to a governmental  entity or third parties for property  damage and for
investigation  and  clean-up  costs.  Even if more than one person may have been
responsible for the  contamination,  the Company may be held responsible for all
of the clean-up costs  incurred.  The liability under  environmental  laws could
adversely affect the Company's cash flow and ability to service its debt.

     All  of  the  Properties   have  been  subject  to  Phase  I  environmental
assessments,  which are  intended  to  discover  information  regarding,  and to


                                       5
<PAGE>

evaluate the  environmental  condition of, the surveyed property and surrounding
properties.  The Phase I  assessments  included a  historical  review,  a public
records  review,  a  preliminary  investigation  of  the  site  and  surrounding
properties  regarding  historic uses for the preparation and issuance of written
reports  by  independent  environmental  consultants.  Some  of  the  Properties
contain, or contained,  underground storage tanks for storing petroleum products
or wastes typically  associated with automobile service or other operations,  as
well as  dry-cleaning  establishments  utilizing  solvents.  If  necessary,  the
Company will sample building materials or conduct subsurface investigations.  At
certain  Properties,  the Company has developed and  implemented  operations and
maintenance  programs with operating  procedures  regarding  asbestos-containing
materials.  Historically,  costs  associated  with these  programs have not been
material.

     The Phase I  assessments  have not revealed any  environmental  liabilities
that the Company believes will have a material effect on its business, assets or
results of  operations,  nor is the Company aware of any such  liability.  It is
possible that the  assessments  do not reveal all  environmental  liabilities or
that  there  are  material  liabilities  of which the  Company  is  unaware.  No
assurances can be given that (i) future laws, ordinances or regulations will not
impose any material  environmental  liability or (ii) the current  environmental
condition of the  Properties  will not be adversely  affected by the tenants and
occupants of the  Properties,  or by the  condition of other  properties  in the
vicinity of the  Properties  or by third parties  unrelated to the Company.  The
Company has obtained environmental insurance on all the Properties acquired from
Jacobs and selected others.

Geographic Concentration

     The Company owns 31 Malls, 15 Associated  Centers, 46 Community Centers and
one Office Building that are located in the  southeastern  United States.  These
Properties  accounted  for 59.4% of the  Company's  total  revenues for the year
ended  December 31, 2002.  Therefore,  the Company's  results of operations  and
funds available for distribution to shareholders are  significantly  impacted by
economic conditions in the southeastern United States.

     The  Company   mitigated  its  dependence  on  the  Southeast  through  the
acquisition of Jacob's interests in 21 Malls and two Associated  Centers,  which
are primarily located in the Midwest region of the United States. The Properties
located in the Midwest  accounted  for 26.9% of the  Company's  revenues for the
year  ended   December  31,  2002.   The  Company  will  continue  to  look  for
opportunities  to  geographically  diversify  its portfolio in order to minimize
dependency on any geographical  region;  however, the expansion of the portfolio
through  both  acquisitions  and  developments  are  contingent  on many factors
including consumer demands, competition and economic conditions.

The Company's Growth Strategy

     The Company's  objective is to achieve  growth in funds from  operations by
maximizing cash flows through a variety of methods that are discussed below.


                                       7
<PAGE>


Leasing, Management and Marketing

     The  Company's  objective  is to  maximize  cash  flows  from its  existing
Properties through:

     *    aggressive leasing that seeks to increase occupancy,
     *    originating and renewing leases at higher base rents per square foot,
     *    merchandising, marketing and promotional activities and
     *    aggressively controlling operating costs and tenant occupancy costs.

Expansions and Renovations

     Most of the Company's  Malls are designed for expansion and growth  through
the  addition  of new  department  stores  and  other  large  format  retailers.
Expansion of the Property can create additional  revenue for the Company as well
as protect the Property's  competitive position within the market.  During 2002,
the Company expanded several Properties including: Meridian Mall in Lansing, MI;
Springdale Mall in Mobile,  AL; Westgate Mall in Spartanburg,  SC; Kentucky Oaks
Mall in Paducah, KY and Bonita Lakes Crossing in Meridian, MS.

     Renovations usually include renovating  existing facades,  uniform signage,
new entrances and floor coverings,  updating interior decor, resurfacing parking
lots and improving the lighting of parking lots.  Renovations can also result in
attracting  new  retailers,  increased  rental  rates and  occupancy  levels and
maintaining the Property's market dominance.

     During  2002,  the Company  renovated  six  properties:  Columbia  Place in
Columbia,  SC;  Hanes Mall in  Winston-Salem,  NC;  Hickory  Hollow Mall and its
associated center,  Courtyard at Hickory Hollow in Nashville,  TN; Kentucky Oaks
Mall in Paducah, KY and Stroud Mall in Stroudsburg, PA.

Development of New Retail Properties

     In general,  the Company seeks  development  opportunities in middle-market
trade areas that it believes are  under-served  by existing  retail  operations.
These middle-markets must also have sufficient demographic trends to provide the
opportunity to effectively maintain a competitive position.  The Company expects
to open  770,000  square  feet of new  developments  during 2003  including  The
Shoppes  at  Hamilton  Place in  Chattanooga,  TN;  Cobblestone  Village  in St.
Augustine,  FL; and Waterford Commons in Waterford,  CT. These developments will
represent an investment by the Company of $80.9 million.

     Coastal Grand in Myrtle Beach,  SC, is under  construction and is projected
to open in the spring of 2004. This 1.5 million square foot mall  development is
owned  in a 50/50  joint  venture  with a  third  party.  Wilkes-Barre  Township
Marketplace  in  Wilkes-Barre  Township,  PA is a 308,000  square foot community
center that is under construction and projected to open in May 2004.

Acquisitions

     The Company  believes there is opportunity for growth through  acquisitions
of  regional  malls and  other  properties.  The  Company  selectively  acquires
regional  mall  properties  where it  believes it can create  value  through its
development, leasing and management expertise.

Risks Associated with the Company's Growth Strategy

     As with any strategy  there are risks  involved with the Company's plan for
growth.  Risks associated with developments and expansions can include,  but are
not limited to: development opportunities pursued may be abandoned; construction
costs may exceed estimates; construction loans with full recourse to the Company
may not be refinanced;  proforma objectives, such as occupancy and rental rates,
may not be achieved;  and the required  approval by an anchor  tenant,  mortgage
lender or property partner for certain expansion/development  activities may not
be obtained. An unsuccessful  development project could result in a loss greater
than the Company's investment.

Insurance

     The  Operating  Partnership  carries a  comprehensive  blanket  policy  for
liability,  fire and rental loss insurance covering all of the Properties,  with
specifications  and insured limits customarily  carried for similar  properties.
The  events  of  September  11,  2001,  impacted  insurance  programs;  however,
management  believes the Properties are  adequately  insured in accordance  with
industry standards.

Competition

     The  Properties  compete  with  various  shopping  alternatives  attracting
retailers to competing locations. Competition for both the consumer and retailer
include power center developments,  outlet shopping centers, discount retailers,
internet  venues,  television  shopping  networks,  direct mail and other retail
shopping  developments.  The extent of the retail competition varies from market
to market. The Company works aggressively to attract customers through marketing
promotions and campaigns.

Qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)

     The Company  intends to continue to be taxed as a REIT under  Sections  856
through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code").  As such, the
Company  generally  will not be subject  to federal  income tax to the extent it
distributes   at  least  90%  of  its  REIT  ordinary   taxable  income  to  its
shareholders.  Failing to qualify as a REIT in any taxable  year would result in
the Company being subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular
corporate rates.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

     Refer  to Item 7:  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  for  additional
performance measurements of the Properties.

Malls

     The Company  owns a  controlling  interest in 51 Malls and  non-controlling
interests  in four Malls.  The Company also owns a 50% interest in one Mall that
is currently under construction.

     The Malls are primarily located in middle markets. The Company believes the
Malls have strong  competitive  positions  because over 90% of the Malls are the
only, or dominant, regional mall in their respective trade areas.

     The Malls generally are anchored by three or more  department  stores and a
wide  variety of mall stores.  Anchor  tenants own or lease their stores and the
non-anchor stores (20,000 square feet or less) lease their locations. Additional
freestanding stores and restaurants are typically located along the perimeter of
the Malls' parking areas.

     The  Company  classifies  its Malls into two  categories  - Malls that have
completed  their  initial  lease-up  ("Stabilized  Malls") and Malls that are in
their initial lease-up phase  ("Non-Stabilized  Malls"). The Non-Stabilized Mall
category currently includes Springdale Mall, a redevelopment  project in Mobile,
AL; Arbor Place in Atlanta  (Douglasville),  GA; The Lakes Mall in Muskegon, MI;
and Parkway  Place in  Huntsville,  AL, which is owned in a joint venture with a
third party.

                                       10
<PAGE>


     The land  underlying  each Mall is owned in fee simple in all cases  except
for Walnut Square,  WestGate Mall, St. Clair Square, Bonita Lakes Mall, Meridian
Mall,  Stroud  Mall,  Wausau  Center and Eastgate  Mall.  Each of these Malls is
subject to long-term ground leases for all or a portion of the land.

     The following table sets forth certain information for each of the Malls as
of December 31,2002.

Anchors

     Anchors are an important  factor in a Mall's  successful  performance.  The
public's  identification  with a mall property  typically  focuses on the anchor
tenants. Mall anchors are generally a department store whose merchandise appeals
to a broad range of shoppers and plays a significant role in generating customer
traffic and creating a desirable location for the mall shop tenants.

     Anchors may own their stores in  conjunction  with the land  underneath and
sometimes the adjacent  parking areas,  or may enter into long-term  leases with
respect to their stores. Rental rates for anchor tenants are significantly lower
than the rents charged to mall store  tenants.  Anchors  account for 8.2% of the
total  revenues from the Company's  Properties.  Each anchor that owns its store
has entered into a reciprocal easement agreement with the Company covering items
such as operating covenants,  reciprocal easements, property operations, initial
construction and future expansion.

During 2002, the Company successfully added several anchors in the Malls:

Community Centers

     The  Company  owns a  controlling  interest  in 61  Community  Centers  and
non-controlling  interests in two Community Centers. The Company also owns three
Community Centers that are currently under construction.

     Community  Centers  typically have less development risk because of shorter
development  periods and lower costs. While Community Centers generally maintain
higher  occupancy  levels and are more stable,  they  typically have slower rent
growth.

     Community Centers are designed to attract local and regional area customers
and are typically anchored by a combination of supermarkets, discount department
stores or drug stores that attract  shoppers to each center's  small shops.  The
tenants  at  the  Company's   Community   Centers   typically  offer  day-to-day
necessities, value-oriented and convenience merchandise.

     The following  table  summarizes  certain  information  about the Community
Centers for the last three years.

ITEM 7:  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations  should  be read  in  conjunction  with  the  consolidated  financial
statements and accompanying notes that are included in this Annual Report.

     Certain  statements made in this section or elsewhere in this report may be
deemed "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities
laws.   Although  the  Company  believes  the  expectations   reflected  in  any
forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions,  the Company can
give no assurance that these  expectations will be attained,  and it is possible
that  actual  results  may  differ  materially  from  those  indicated  by these
forward-looking  statements  due to a variety of risks and  uncertainties.  Such
risks and uncertainties include, without limitation,  general industry, economic
and  business  conditions,  interest  rate  fluctuations,  costs of capital  and
capital  requirements,  availability  of real estate  properties,  inability  to
consummate  acquisition  opportunities,  competition  from other  companies  and
retail formats,  changes in retail rental rates in the Company's markets, shifts
in customer demands,  tenant bankruptcies or store closings,  changes in vacancy
rates at the Company's  properties,  changes in operating  expenses,  changes in
applicable laws,  rules and  regulations,  the ability to obtain suitable equity
and/or debt financing and the continued availability of financing in the amounts
and on the terms necessary to support the Company's future business. The Company
disclaims any obligation to update or revise any  forward-looking  statements to
reflect actual results or changes in the factors  affecting the  forward-looking
information.

GENERAL BACKGROUND

     CBL & Associates  Properties,  Inc.'s consolidated financial statements and
accompanying  notes  reflect  the  consolidated   financial  results  of  CBL  &
Associates  Limited   Partnership  (the  "Operating   Partnership")  and  CBL  &
Associates  Management,  Inc.  (the  "Management  Company").  CBL  &  Associates
Properties,  Inc.,  the Operating  Partnership  and the  Management  Company are
referred to  collectively  as the "Company." At December 31, 2002, the Company's
portfolio of properties  consisted of 51 regional malls, 18 associated  centers,
61 community  centers,  an office  building,  joint venture  investments in four
regional  malls,  two  associated  centers and two  community  centers,  plus 11
mortgages  (the  "Properties").  The Operating  Partnership  currently has under
construction one mall, which is owned in a joint venture,  one associated center
and three  community  centers,  and options to acquire  certain  shopping center
development sites.

     The Company has reclassified certain financial  information in the 2001 and
2000 consolidated  financial  statements to conform to the 2002 presentation.  A
portion of the results of operations of the  Company's  taxable REIT  subsidiary
was reported on a net basis in prior years' financial information.  However, due
to growth of those  operations,  the Company  has  presented  the  taxable  REIT
subsidiary's  results of operations on a gross basis,  with revenues included in
interest  and other  revenues  and the  related  expenses  included in the other
expenses caption.

COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2002, TO
THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001

     The following significant transactions impact the comparison of the results
of operations  for the year ended  December 31, 2002, to the year ended December
31, 2001:

     *    The  Company  acquired  ownership   interests  in  21  malls  and  two
          associated  centers  from The Richard E. Jacobs  Group  ("Jacobs")  on
          January  31,  2001;  therefore,  the  results of  operations  for 2002
          include an  additional  month of  operations  for these  properties as
          compared to 2001. In March 2002, the Company  completed the second and
          final  stage  of  the  Jacobs  acquisition  by  acquiring   additional
          interests in four malls and one associated center.

                                       28

     *    The  Company  opened or  acquired  nine  additional  properties  since
          February  1,  2001.  The new  properties  opened  or  acquired  are as
          follows:

     *    Several  properties  were  sold  during  2001  and  their  results  of
          operations are included in the consolidated statement of operations in
          2001 through each property's  respective disposal date. The results of
          operations   for   properties   sold  during  2002  are   included  in
          discontinued  operations for all periods  presented as a result of the
          adoption  of a  new  accounting  pronouncement  (see  Note  4  to  the
          consolidated financial statements).  Therefore, when comparing results
          for the year ended  December 31, 2002, to the year ended  December 31,
          2001,  the  variances   will  include  a  reduction   related  to  the

     *    During  the  first  quarter  of 2002,  the  Company  began to  include
          Columbia  Place  in  Columbia,   SC,  in  its  consolidated  financial
          statements after acquiring an additional 31% interest in the property,
          which resulted in the Company owning a 79% controlling  interest.  The
          Company's  interest in Columbia  Place was  previously  accounted  for
          using the equity  method of  accounting.  In August 2002,  the Company
          acquired the remaining 21% interest in Columbia Place.

     *    In February  2002,  the Company  contributed  90% of its  interests in
          Pemberton  Plaza, an associated  center in Vicksburg,  MS, and Massard
          Crossing  and  Willowbrook  Plaza,  community  centers  located in Ft.
          Smith, AR, and Houston, TX,  respectively,  to a joint venture that is
          accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Prior to the date
          of  contribution,  the results of operations of these  properties were
          included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

</TABLE>

Revenues

     The  increase in revenues  was  primarily  attributable  to three  factors.
First,  an  additional  month  of  operations  in  2002  related  to the  Jacobs
properties  combined  with  improvements  in leasing and occupancy at the Jacobs
properties,  contributed $21.9 million to the increase.  Second,  the additional
nine  properties  opened or  acquired  during  2002 and 2001  contributed  $30.1
million to the increase.  Third,  continued improvement in leasing and occupancy
at existing  properties  contributed  $5.9  million to the  increase.  The above
increases  include an increase in lease termination fees of $1.4 million to $5.5
million in 2002 compared to 4.1 million in 2001.  These increases were offset by
reductions  in revenues of $5.0 million  related to the  properties  sold during
2001 and $6.4 million related to the three properties that were contributed to a
joint venture early in 2002.

     Management,  leasing and  development  fees  increased $2.0 million in 2002
compared to 2001  primarily  due to growth in  management  and leasing fees from
unconsolidated  affiliates that were acquired in the Jacobs transaction and from
an unconsolidated affiliate that began operations during 2002.

     Interest and other revenues increased $1.6 million due to growth in certain
operations of the Company's taxable REIT subsidiaries.

Expenses

     Property  operating  expenses  increased by $4.6  million,  including  real
estate taxes and maintenance and repairs,  due to the additional month this year
related to the Jacobs  properties  and $11.4  million  related to the other nine
properties  opened or acquired during 2002 and 2001. These increases were offset
by a total of $2.3 million  related to both the properties  sold during 2001 and
the three  properties  contributed  to a joint venture in 2002. The remainder of
the increase was due to increases in general operating costs.

     Depreciation and amortization  expense increased by $2.0 million due to the
additional  month related to the Jacobs  properties and $3.5 million  related to
the  other  nine  properties  opened or  acquired  during  2002 and 2001.  These
increases were offset by a total of $1.9 million  related to both the properties
sold during 2001 and the three  properties  contributed to a joint venture.  The
increase is also  attributable to depreciation on the capital  expenditures made
during 2002 and 2001 in connection  with the Company's  ongoing  renovations and
expansions of existing  properties to maintain  their  competitive  positions in
their respective trade areas.

                                       30
<PAGE>

     General and administrative  expenses increased $4.5 million,  primarily due
to  additional  salaries  and  benefits  for the  personnel  added to manage the
properties  acquired during 2001 and 2002.  Increased  professional fees and the
costs to move the Company to its new corporate  headquarters also contributed to
the increase.

     Interest  expense  decreased  $13.5  million due primarily to reductions of
debt with net  proceeds  of $114.7  million  from the March  2002  common  stock
offering and net proceeds of $96.4  million from the June 2002  preferred  stock
offering.

Gain on Sales of Real Estate Assets

     The net gain on sales of $2.8 million in 2002 was related to total gains of
$3.3 million on seven  outparcel sales and total losses of $0.5 million on three
outparcel  sales.  The decrease  from the net gain on sales of $10.6  million in
2001 results  primarily  because the 2001 amount includes a net gain on sales of
operating  properties  of $8.4  million.  The net  gain on  sales  of  operating
properties in 2002 is included in discontinued operations due to the adoption of
a new accounting pronouncement in 2002 (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements).

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates

     The increase in equity in earnings of  unconsolidated  affiliates  resulted
from the Company's acquisition of additional partnership interests in East Towne
Mall, West Towne Mall and West Towne Crossing in Madison,  WI, and Kentucky Oaks
Mall in Paducah,  KY, in March 2002.  The  increase  was offset by the effect of
accounting for Columbia Place as a consolidated  property in 2002 as compared to
an unconsolidated affiliate in 2001.

Discontinued Operations

     The Company sold five community  centers and an office building during 2002
for a net gain of $0.4 million.  Three community centers and the office building
were sold for a gain and two  community  centers were sold at a loss.  Operating
income from discontinued  operations decreased to $0.9 million in 2002 from $2.2
million in 2001 because the prior year included a full year of operations, while
the current year only included the results of  operations  through the date each
property was sold.

Extraordinary Loss

     Extraordinary  loss decreased from $13.6 million in 2001 to $3.9 million in
2002 since the Company retired less debt subject to prepayment penalties in 2002
than it did in 2001.  The  extraordinary  loss in 2002  consisted of  prepayment
penalties of $2.3 million and the write-off of  unamortized  deferred  financing
costs of $1.6 million.


COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2001, TO
THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000

     The following significant transactions impact the comparison of the results
of operations  for the year ended  December 31, 2001 to the year ended  December
31, 2000.

     The  Company  acquired or opened 26  properties  during 2001 as compared to
four properties during 2000. Eighteen of the properties acquired from Jacobs are
included in the  consolidated  results of operations of the Company and five are


                                       31
<PAGE>

accounted for as unconsolidated affiliates. Therefore, the results of operations
for 2001  reflect  a  significant  increase  when  compared  to the  results  of
operations for 2000.

     The Company disposed of six properties during 2001 and 13 properties during
2000, which offsets the increases from the  acquisitions and openings  discussed
above.

     The following is a comparison of the consolidated results of operations for
2001 to the results for 2000:

</TABLE>

Revenues

     Approximately  $161.5  million of the increase was  attributable  to the 18
properties  acquired from Jacobs that are accounted for on a consolidated basis.
Approximately  $25.6  million of the increase  resulted from the other eight new
properties  opened or acquired during 2001 and 2000. These increases were offset
by a decrease in  revenues of $5.5  million  related to the 19  properties  sold
during 2001 and 2000.

     Improved  occupancies,  improved  operations  and  increased  rents  in the
Company's  operating  portfolio  generated  approximately  $1.0  million  of the
increase in revenues.  Additionally,  lease  termination  fees increased by $3.3
million to $4.1 million in 2001 from $0.7 million in 2000.

     Interest and other  revenues  increased  primarily due to growth in certain
operations of the Company's  taxable REIT  subsidiary,  which  contributed  $5.9
million to the increase.

Expenses

     Property  operating  expenses,  including real estate taxes and maintenance
and repairs,  increased in 2001 as a result of the 26 new  properties  opened or
acquired during 2001 and 2000. The Company's cost recovery ratio,  not including
bad debt expense of $5.9 million,  was 96.6% in 2001 compared with 99.9% in 2000
due to decreases in occupancy and the bankruptcy of tenants who were replaced on
a short-term basis with tenants whose recovery clauses are more restrictive.

     Depreciation and  amortization  increased in 2001 primarily from additional
depreciation and amortization on the 26 new properties opened or acquired during


                                       32
<PAGE>

2001 and 2000 and the Company's capital  investment in operating  properties for
renovations  and  expansions.  This was offset by a reduction  related to the 19
properties that were sold during 2001 and 2000.

     Interest expense increased in 2001 primarily due to additional debt related
to the 26 new  properties  opened or acquired  during  2001 and 2000,  offset by
reductions  in interest  expense  related to debt retired with proceeds from the
sales of properties.

     General and  administrative  expenses increased in 2001 due to increases in
general  overhead to manage the  properties  that were acquired in January 2001.
The amount of the increase in general and administrative expense was offset by a
$1.0 million reduction in reserves for state taxes.

Gain on Sales of Real Estate Assets

     Gain on sales  includes  $8.4  million of gains  related  to six  community
centers  that were sold in 2001.  Additional  gains were  generated  by sales of
outparcels  including  sales at The Lakes Mall in Muskegon,  MI, which opened in
August 2001.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates

     The  increase  in  equity  in  earnings  was  the  result  of  acquiring  a
non-controlling  interest  in four  malls  and one  associated  center  in three
partnerships from Jacobs. All of these are accounted for using the equity method
of accounting. The increase was offset by decreases resulting from the cessation
of operations at Parkway Place in Huntsville, AL, while it was redeveloped,  and
by the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in Madison Square Mall in
Huntsville,  AL.  Since the Company now owns a 100%  interest in Madison  Square
Mall, its results have been included in the  consolidated  financial  statements
since the date the remaining interest was acquired.

Extraordinary Loss

     Extraordinary loss increased since the Company retired more higher interest
rate debt  subject  to  prepayment  penalties  in 2001 than it did in 2000.  The
extraordinary  loss in 2001  consisted of prepayment  penalties of $13.0 million
and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.5 million.

PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS

     The shopping  center  business is, to some extent,  seasonal in nature with
tenants  achieving the highest levels of sales during the fourth quarter because
of the holiday  season.  The malls earn most of their  "temporary"  rents (rents
from short-term tenants),  during the holiday period. Thus, occupancy levels and
revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year.
Results of  operations  realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the
results likely to be experienced over the course of the fiscal year.

     The Company  classifies its regional malls into two categories - malls that
have completed their initial lease-up ("Stabilized Malls") and malls that are in
their initial lease-up phase  ("Non-Stabilized  Malls"). The Non-Stabilized Mall
category currently includes Springdale Mall, a redevelopment  project in Mobile,
AL;  Arbor Place Mall in Atlanta  (Douglasville),  GA,  which  opened in October
1999;  The Lakes Mall in Muskegon,  MI, which opened in August 2001; and Parkway
Place in  Huntsville,  AL,  which opened in October 2002 and is owned in a joint
venture with a third party.

     The Company's  revenues,  including  the  Company's  share of revenues from
unconsolidated  affiliates and excluding minority  interests' share of revenues,
were derived from the Company's three property types as follows:

Sales and Occupancy Costs

     For those  tenants who occupy  10,000 square feet or less and have reported
sales,  mall  shop  sales  in the 50  Stabilized  Malls  decreased  by 1.6% on a
comparable  per square  foot basis to $293.10 per square foot for the year ended
December 31, 2002,  from $297.84 per square foot for the year ended December 31,
2001.

     Total sales volume in the mall portfolio,  including  Non-Stabilized Malls,
increased  0.4% to $3.017  billion for the year ended  December 31,  2002,  from
$3.004 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001.

     Occupancy  costs as a percentage of sales for the years ended  December 31,
2002 and 2001, for the Stabilized Malls were 12.0% and 11.3%, respectively.

Occupancy

     Occupancy for the Company's portfolio was as follows:

</TABLE>

     Occupancy for  Non-Stabilized  Malls declined primarily due to the addition
of  Parkway  Place to the  category  when it opened in October  2002.  Excluding
Parkway Place,  occupancy was 88.2% for the Non-Stabilized Malls at December 31,
2002.

     Occupancy  for the  community  centers  declined  because of the  vacancies
resulting from the bankruptcies of Home Place at Kingston Overlook in Knoxville,
TN,  and  Quality  Stores at  Sattler  Square in Big  Rapids,  MI. The spaces at
Kingston  Overlook and Sattler Square have been  re-leased,  and the new tenants
are scheduled to open during the first half of 2003.

CASH FLOWS

     Cash provided by operating  activities  increased  $60.8 million due to (i)
one additional  month of operations  for the properties  acquired from Jacobs on
January  31,  2001,  (ii) the  addition  of the nine new  properties  opened  or
acquired since February 2001 and (iii) the acquisitions of additional  interests
in Columbia  Place during 2002.  These  increases  were offset by  reductions in
results  of  operations  related  to the  properties  that have been sold  since
February 2001 and the three  properties in which the Company  contributed 90% of
its interest to a joint venture.

     Cash used in investing activities increased $73.4 million because more cash
was used to acquire real estate  assets in 2002  compared to 2001.  The purchase
prices of Richland Mall,  Westmoreland  Mall and Westmoreland  Crossing were all
cash and totaled  $155.7  million.  The Company also paid $38.3 million more for
capital expenditures in 2002 than it paid in 2001.

     Cash provided by financing  activities was $3.9 million in 2002 compared to
cash used in financing  activities of $6.9 million in 2001.  The change of $10.8
million was due to proceeds  from the  issuance of common and  preferred  stock,
increased  borrowings  and a  reduction  in the amount of  prepayment  penalties
incurred in 2002 as compared to 2001. This was offset by a significant  increase
in the amount of loan  repayments,  the  purchase  of  preferred  stock,  and an
increase in the amount of dividends and distributions paid.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     The  principal  uses  of the  Company's  liquidity  and  capital  resources
historically  have  been  for  property  development,  expansions,  renovations,
acquisitions,  debt repayment and  distributions  to  shareholders.  In order to
maintain its  qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income
tax purposes,  the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its taxable
income,  computed  without  regard to net  capital  gains or the  dividends-paid
deduction, to its shareholders.

     The  Company's   current  capital  structure   includes   property-specific
mortgages  (which are  generally  non-recourse),  construction  and term  loans,
revolving  lines  of  credit,  common  stock,  preferred  stock,  joint  venture
investments and a minority interest in the Operating Partnership.

     The Company anticipates that the combination of its equity and debt sources
will, for the foreseeable  future,  provide  adequate  liquidity to continue its
capital  programs  substantially  as in the past and make  distributions  to its
shareholders  in  accordance  with the  requirements  applicable  to real estate
investment trusts.

     The  Company's  policy is to maintain a  conservative  debt-to-total-market
capitalization  ratio in order to enhance  its access to the  broadest  range of
capital markets, both public and private.  Based on the Company's share of total
consolidated  and  unconsolidated  debt and the market value of equity described
below, the Company's debt-to-total-market capitalization (debt plus market-value
equity) ratio was 50.6% at December 31, 2002.

Equity

     As a publicly  traded  company,  the Company has access to capital  through
both the public  equity and debt  markets.  The Company has an  effective  shelf
registration  statement  authorizing  it to publicly  issue  shares of preferred
stock,  common  stock and  warrants to purchase  shares of common  stock with an
aggregate  public offering price of up to $350 million,  of which  approximately
$62.3 million remains after the preferred stock offering on June 14, 2002.

     As of December 31, 2002, the minority interest in the Operating Partnership
includes the 16.0% ownership  interest in the Operating  Partnership held by the
Company's   executive   and  senior   officers,   which  may  be  exchanged  for
approximately  8.9 million shares of common stock.  Additionally,  executive and
senior  officers  and  directors  own  approximately  2.1 million  shares of the
Company's  outstanding  common  stock,  for a  combined  total  interest  in the
Operating Partnership of approximately 19.9%.

     Limited  partnership  interests  issued to  acquire  Jacobs'  interests  in
shopping  center  properties in January 2001 and March 2002 may be exchanged for
approximately  12.0 million  shares of common  stock,  which  represents a 21.5%
interest  in the  Operating  Partnership.  Other  third-party  interests  may be
exchanged for approximately 4.8 million shares of common stock, which represents
an 8.8% interest in the Operating Partnership.

     Assuming the exchange of all limited partnership interests in the Operating
Partnership for common stock,  there would be approximately  55.5 million shares
of common stock outstanding with a market value of approximately  $2.222 billion
at December 31, 2002 (based on the closing price of $40.05 per share on December
31, 2002).  The Company's total market equity is $2.389 billion,  which includes
2.675  million  shares of Series A preferred  stock  ($66.9  million  based on a
liquidation  preference of $25.00 per share) and 2.0 million  shares of Series B
preferred stock ($100.0 million based on a liquidation  preference of $50.00 per
share).  The Company's  executive and senior officers' and directors'  ownership
interests  had a market value of  approximately  $439.8  million at December 31,
2002.

Debt

     The Company's share of mortgage debt on consolidated  properties,  adjusted
for minority  investors'  interests in six  properties and its pro rata share of
mortgage debt on seven unconsolidated properties,  consisted of the following at
December 31, 2002 and 2001 (in thousands):

     The Company's lines of credit total $345.3 million, of which $124.0 million
was available at December 31, 2002.

     On  February  28,  2003,  the Company  announced  that it replaced a $130.0
million  secured line of credit and a $105.3  million  unsecured  line of credit
with a new $255.0 million secured lines of credit with a group of banks. The new
line of credit  matures  in 2006,  has a  one-year  extension  option  and bears
interest at a rate of 100 basis points over the London  Interbank  Offered Rate.
This line of credit does not require any scheduled principal payments.

     As of December 31, 2002, total  commitments under  construction  loans were
$61.0 million, of which $39.1 million was available to be used for completion of
construction  and  redevelopment  projects and  replenishment of working capital
previously used for construction.

     The Company had additional  lines of credit totaling $14.6 million that are
used only for  issuances  of  letters  of  credit,  of which  $8.5  million  was
outstanding at December 31, 2002.

     The Company has fixed the  interest  rate on $80.0  million of an operating
property's  debt at a rate of 6.95% using an interest rate swap  agreement  that
expires  in  August  2003.  The  Company  did not  incur  any  fees for the swap
agreement.

     During 2002, the Company  closed five variable rate loans  totaling  $115.4
million to be used for  construction  and acquisition  purposes,  of which $47.6
million was outstanding at December 31, 2002.

     The Company also closed 12  non-recourse  mortgage  loans  totaling  $522.9
million that bear interest at  fixed-rates  ranging from 6.25% to 6.85%,  with a
weighted  average of 6.56%.  Nine malls,  two associated  centers and the office
building secure these fixed-rate mortgages.

     On February 28, 2003, the Company announced that it closed an $85.0 million
non-recourse  loan that bears interest at 5.05% for a term of 10 years. The loan
is  secured  by  Westmoreland  Mall  and  its  associated  center,  Westmoreland
Crossing,  which the Company  acquired in December 2002 with borrowings from the
lines of credit.

     The Company  expects to refinance  the majority of mortgage and other notes
payable  maturing over the next five years with replacement  loans.  Taking into
consideration  extension options that are available to the Company, there are no
debt  maturities   through  December  31,  2003,  other  than  normal  principal
amortization.

DEVELOPMENTS, EXPANSIONS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

     The Company  expects to  continue  to have access to the capital  resources
necessary to expand and develop its business. Future development and acquisition
activities will be undertaken as suitable  opportunities arise. The Company does
not expect to pursue these  activities  unless adequate sources of financing are
available and a satisfactory budget with targeted returns on investment has been
internally approved.

     The Company  intends to fund major  development,  expansion and acquisition
activities with traditional sources of construction and permanent debt financing
as well as other debt and equity financings, including public financings and the
lines of credit,  in a manner  consistent  with its  intention to operate with a
conservative debt-to-total-market capitalization ratio.

     The  Company  has  entered  into a  number  of  option  agreements  for the
development  of future  regional  malls and  community  centers.  Except for the
projects  discussed under  Developments  and Expansions  above and  Acquisitions
below, the Company does not have any other material capital commitments.

Acquisitions

     The  Company's  acquisitions  are  discussed in Note 3 to the  consolidated
financial statements.

Dispositions

     During 2002, five community centers and an office building were sold for an
aggregate sales price of $36.8 million, resulting in a net gain of $0.4 million.
Three  community  centers and the office  building  were sold for a gain and two
community centers were sold at a loss.

     In addition, the Company sold seven outparcels for gains and two outparcels
and a department store building for losses, which resulted in a net gain of $2.8
million in 2002.

OTHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

     The Company prepares an annual capital expenditure budget for each property
that is  intended  to provide  for all  necessary  recurring  and  non-recurring
capital improvements.  The Company believes that its operating cash flows, which
include reimbursements from tenants, will provide the necessary funding for such
capital improvements. These cash flows will be sufficient to cover tenant finish
costs  associated  with  renewing or replacing  current  tenant  leases as their
leases expire and capital expenditures that will not be reimbursed by tenants.

     Including its share of unconsolidated affiliates' capital expenditures, the
Company  spent  $31.6  million in 2002 for  tenant  allowances,  which  generate
increased  rents from these  tenants  over the terms of their  leases.  Deferred
maintenance  expenditures,  a majority of which are recovered  from the tenants,


                                       38
<PAGE>

were $19.3 million for 2002. Deferred  maintenance  expenditures  included $10.2
million for resurfacing and improved  lighting of parking lots, $8.1 million for
roof repairs and replacements  and $1.0 million for various other  expenditures.
Renovation  expenditures  were  $57.4  million  in 2002,  a portion  of which is
recovered from tenants.

     Deferred  maintenance  expenditures  are billed to  tenants as common  area
maintenance  expense,  and  most  are  recovered  over a 5- to  15-year  period.
Renovation  expenditures  are primarily for remodeling and upgrades of malls, of
which approximately 30% is recovered from tenants over a 5- to 15-year period.

OTHER

     The Company  believes the  Properties  are in  compliance,  in all material
respects, with federal, state and local ordinances and regulations regarding the
handling,  discharge and emission of hazardous or toxic substances.  The Company
has not been notified by any governmental authority, and is not otherwise aware,
of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic
substances  in  connection  with  any  of  its  present  or  former  properties.
Therefore,  the Company has not recorded any  material  liability in  connection
with environmental matters.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     A  critical  accounting  policy  is  one  that  is  both  important  to the
presentation  of a company's  financial  condition and results of operations and
requires  significant  judgment  or complex  estimation  processes.  The Company
believes that its most significant  accounting policies are those related to its
accounting for the  development of real estate assets and evaluating  long-lived
assets for impairment.

     The Company capitalizes predevelopment project costs paid to third parties.
All  previously  capitalized  predevelopment  costs are  expensed  when it is no
longer  probable  that the project  will be  completed.  Once  development  of a
project commences, all direct costs incurred to construct the project, including
interest and real estate taxes are  capitalized.  Additionally,  certain general
and administrative  expenses are allocated to the projects and capitalized based
on the personnel assigned to the development  project, and the investment in the
project  relative to all development  projects.  Once a project is completed and
placed in service,  it is depreciated over its estimated useful life.  Buildings
and  improvements  are  depreciated   generally  over  40  years  and  leasehold
improvements  are  amortized  over the  lives of the  applicable  leases  or the
estimated useful life of the assets, whichever is shorter.  Ordinary repairs and
maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Major  replacements  and improvements are
capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.

     The Company  periodically  evaluates its real estate assets to determine if
there has been any  impairment in their carrying  values and records  impairment
losses if the undiscounted  cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets
are less than the assets'  carrying  amounts or if there are other indicators of
impairment. At December 31, 2002, the Company did not own any real estate assets
that were impaired.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     As  described  in  Note 2 to the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the
Financial  Accounting  Standards Board has issued certain statements,  which are
effective beginning in 2003.

                                       39
<PAGE>

IMPACT OF INFLATION

     In the last three years,  inflation has not had a significant impact on the
Company because of the relatively low inflation rate.  Substantially  all tenant
leases do, however,  contain provisions designed to protect the Company from the
impact of inflation.  These  provisions  include clauses enabling the Company to
receive  percentage rent based on tenants' gross sales, which generally increase
as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates
during the terms of the leases. In addition, many of the leases are for terms of
less than 10 years which may enable the Company to replace  existing leases with
new leases at higher base and/or percentage rent if rents of the existing leases
are below the then existing  market rate. Most of the leases require the tenants
to pay their share of operating  expenses,  including  common area  maintenance,
real  estate  taxes and  insurance,  which  reduces  the  Company's  exposure to
increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

     Funds From  Operations  ("FFO") is defined by the National  Association  of
Real Estate  Investment  Trusts ("NAREIT") as net income (computed in accordance
with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States) excluding
gains (or  losses)  on sales of  operating  properties,  plus  depreciation  and
amortization,  and after adjustments for  unconsolidated  partnerships and joint
ventures.  Adjustments  for  FFO  from  unconsolidated  partnerships  and  joint
ventures are calculated on the same basis. The Company defines FFO available for
distribution  to common  shareholders  as defined above by NAREIT less preferred
dividends and gains or losses on outparcel  sales.  The Company  computes FFO in
accordance  with  the  NAREIT   recommendation   concerning  finance  costs  and
non-real-estate  depreciation.  The Company's  method of calculating  FFO may be
different  from  methods  used  by  other  REITs  and,  accordingly,  may not be
comparable to such other REITs.

     The Company  believes  that FFO  provides an  additional  indicator  of the
financial  performance  of the  Properties.  The use of FFO as an  indicator  of
financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of the Properties
and interest  rates,  but also by the capital  structures of the Company and the
Operating Partnership.  Accordingly,  FFO will be one of the significant factors
considered  by the  Board  of  Directors  in  determining  the  amount  of  cash
distributions the Operating Partnership will make to its partners, including the
REIT.

     FFO does not represent  cash flow from  operations as defined by accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States,  is  not  necessarily
indicative  of cash  available  to fund all cash flow  needs and  should  not be
considered  as an  alternative  to net income for  purposes  of  evaluating  the
Company's operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.

     FFO  increased  in 2002 by $42.6  million,  or  22.0%,  to  $236.6  million
compared  to  $194.0   million  in  2001.  The  increase  in  FFO  is  primarily
attributable  to reduced  interest  expense,  the results of  operations  of the
properties added to the portfolio and a full twelve months of operations for the
properties  acquired  from  Jacobs  compared  to eleven  months  in 2001.  These
increases were offset by reductions  related to operating  properties  that were
sold or contributed to a joint venture.  Additionally,  lease  termination  fees
were $1.4 million more in 2002 as compared to 2001.  FFO would have increased by
$2.8 million and $10.6  million in 2002 and 2001,  respectively,  if the Company
included outparcel sales in its computation of FFO.

ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The Company has exposure to interest rate risk on its debt  obligations and
interest rate  instruments.  Based on the Company's  share of  consolidated  and
unconsolidated  variable-rate debt in place at December 31, 2002, excluding debt
fixed  using an interest  rate swap  agreement,  a 0.5%  increase or decrease in
interest rates on this  variable-rate debt would increase or decrease cash flows
by  approximately  $2.4 million and, due to the effect of capitalized  interest,
annual earnings by approximately $2.3 million.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT




To CBL & Associates Properties, Inc.:


     We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of CBL &
Associates  Properties,  Inc. (a Delaware  corporation)  and  subsidiaries as of
December  31,  2002  and  2001,  and  the  related  consolidated  statements  of
operations,  shareholders'  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period  ended  December  31, 2002.  Our audits also  included the  financial
statement  schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial  statements
and  financial  statement  schedules  are the  responsibility  of the  Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards  require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of CBL & Associates Properties,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the United States of America.  Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedules,  when  considered  in  relation to the basic  consolidated  financial
statements  taken  as a whole,  present  fairly  in all  material  respects  the
information set forth therein.

     As discussed in Note 4 to the financial  statements,  in 2002,  the Company
changed  its method of  accounting  for  discontinued  operations  to conform to
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in thousands, except share data)

NOTE 1.  ORGANIZATION

     CBL & Associates Properties,  Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation,
is a self-managed,  self-administered,  fully integrated real estate  investment
trust ("REIT") that is engaged in the development,  acquisition and operation of
regional  shopping malls and community  centers.  The Company's  shopping center
properties are located primarily in the Southeast,  as well as in select markets
in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States.

     The  Company  conducts  substantially  all of its  business  through  CBL &
Associates Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership"). The Company is the
100% owner of two  qualified  REIT  subsidiaries,  CBL  Holdings I, Inc. and CBL
Holdings  II,  Inc.  CBL  Holdings I, Inc.  is the sole  general  partner of the
Operating  Partnership.  At December 31, 2002, CBL Holdings I, Inc. owned a 1.7%
general  partnership  interest and CBL Holdings II, Inc.  owned a 52.0%  limited
partnership  interest in the Operating  Partnership for a combined interest held
by the Company of 53.7%.

     At December 31, 2002, the Operating  Partnership owns controlling interests
in 51  regional  malls,  18  associated  centers  (each  adjacent  to a regional
shopping mall), 61 community centers and an office building.  Additionally,  the
Operating Partnership owns non-controlling interests in four regional malls, two
associated  centers  and  two  community  centers.  The  Operating   Partnership
currently has under  construction  one mall,  which is owned in a joint venture,
one associated  center,  and three community  centers and has options to acquire
certain development properties owned by third parties.

     The minority interest in the Operating Partnership is held primarily by CBL
& Associates,  Inc. and its affiliates (collectively "CBL's Predecessor") and by
affiliates of The Richard E. Jacobs Group,  Inc.  ("Jacobs").  CBL's Predecessor
contributed their interests in certain real estate properties and joint ventures
to the Operating Partnership in exchange for a limited partnership interest when
the Operating  Partnership was formed in November 1993. Jacobs contributed their
interests in certain real estate  properties and joint ventures to the Operating
Partnership  in exchange for a limited  partnership  interest when the Operating
Partnership  acquired Jacobs' interests in 23 properties as discussed in Note 3.
At December  31,  2002,  CBL's  Predecessor  owned a 16.0%  limited  partnership
interest,  Jacobs owned a 21.5% limited  partnership  interest and third parties
owned an 8.8% limited  partnership  interest in the Operating  Partnership (Note
9). CBL's  Predecessor also owned 2,135,249 shares of the Company's common stock
at December 31, 2002,  for a combined  total  interest of 19.9% in the Operating
Partnership.

     The Operating  Partnership  conducts the Company's property  management and
development   activities  through  CBL  &  Associates   Management,   Inc.  (the
"Management  Company")  to comply  with  certain  requirements  of the  Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  The Operating  Partnership holds
100% of the  preferred  stock and owns 6% of the common stock of the  Management
Company.  CBL's Predecessor holds the remaining 94% of the Management  Company's
common  stock.  Through its  ownership of the  preferred  stock,  the  Operating
Partnership receives substantially all of the cash flow and enjoys substantially
all of the economic benefits of the Management Company's operations.

     As sole general partner, the Company controls the Operating Partnership and
the Operating Partnership's rights to substantially all of the economic benefits
of the Management Company. As a result, the accounts of each entity are included
in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements.   The  Company,  the
Operating  Partnership,  and the Management Company are referred to collectively
as the "Company."

     All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in the consolidated presentation.

NOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Real Estate Assets

     Real estate assets,  including  acquired assets,  are stated at cost. Costs
incurred for the development, construction and improvement of real estate assets
are  capitalized,  including  overhead costs directly  attributable  to property
development.   Interest  costs  and  real  estate  taxes  incurred   during  the
development and construction  period are capitalized and depreciated on the same
basis as the related asset.  Ordinary  repairs and  maintenance  are expensed as
incurred.

     Depreciation is computed on a  straight-line  basis over estimated lives of
40 years for  buildings,  10 to 20 years for  certain  improvements  and 7 to 10
years for  equipment and  fixtures.  Tenant  improvements  are  capitalized  and
depreciated  on a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term of the  related  lease.
Lease-related  intangibles from acquisitions of real estate assets are amortized
over the remaining terms of the related leases.

     Total interest expense  capitalized was $5,109,  $5,860 and $6,288 in 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

Long-Lived Assets

     The Company  evaluates the carrying  value of long-lived  assets to be held
and used when  events or changes in  circumstances  warrant  such a review.  The
carrying value of a long-lived  asset is considered  impaired when its estimated
future  undiscounted  cash  flows are less  than its  carrying  value.  If it is
determined that an impairment has occurred,  the excess of the asset's  carrying
value over its estimated fair value will be charged to operations. There were no
impairment charges in 2002, 2001 and 2000.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

     The  Company   considers  all  highly  liquid   investments  with  original
maturities of three months or less as cash equivalents.

Deferred Financing Costs

     Net deferred  financing  costs of $9,767 and $9,396 were  included in other
assets at December 31, 2002 and 2001,  respectively.  Deferred  financing  costs
include fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term  financing and are amortized
to interest  expense over the terms of the related notes  payable.  Amortization
expense was $4,114,  $4,766,  and $2,072 in 2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.
Accumulated  amortization  was $4,631 and $3,700 as of  December  2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Revenue Recognition

     Minimum  rental   revenue  from   operating   leases  is  recognized  on  a
straight-line  basis  over the  initial  terms of the  related  leases.  Certain
tenants  are  required to pay  percentage  rent if their  sales  volumes  exceed
thresholds specified in their lease agreements. Percentage rent is recognized as
revenue when the thresholds are achieved and the amounts become determinable.

     The Company  receives  reimbursements  from tenants for real estate  taxes,
insurance, common area maintenance,  and other recoverable operating expenses as
provided  in the lease  agreements.  Tenant  reimbursements  are  recognized  as
revenue  in the period the  related  operating  expenses  are  incurred.  Tenant
reimbursements  related to certain  capital  expenditures  are billed to tenants
over periods of 5 to 15 years and are recognized as revenue when billed.

     The Company  receives  management,  leasing and development fees from third
parties  and  unconsolidated  affiliates.  Management  fees  are  charged  as  a
percentage of minimum and  percentage  rents and are  recognized as revenue when
earned.  Development fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the


                                       59
<PAGE>

development  period.  Leasing  fees are  charged for newly  executed  leases and
recognized as revenue when earned.

Gain on Sales of Real Estate Assets

     Gain on sales of real estate assets is  recognized  when title to the asset
is transferred to the buyer, if the buyer's initial and continuing investment is
adequate and the buyer assumes all future ownership risks of the asset.

Income Taxes

     The Company is qualified  as a REIT under the  provisions  of the Code.  To
maintain qualification as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least
90% of its taxable income to shareholders and meet certain other requirements.

     As a REIT, the Company is generally not liable for federal corporate income
taxes.  If the  Company  fails to qualify  as a REIT in any  taxable  year,  the
Company will be subject to federal and state income taxes on its taxable  income
at regular  corporate tax rates. Even if the Company maintains its qualification
as a REIT,  the Company  may be subject to certain  state and local taxes on its
income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed
income. State income taxes were not material in 2002, 2001 and 2000.

     The Company  had a net  deferred  tax asset at December  31, 2002 and 2001,
which consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards,  that was reduced
to zero by a valuation allowance because of uncertainty about the realization of
the net deferred tax asset considering all available evidence.

Derivative Financial Instruments

     On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities," as amended,  which established  accounting and reporting  standards
for derivative instruments.

     SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize every derivative instrument as
either  an  asset  or  liability  measured  at its fair  value.  The fair  value
adjustments  affect  either  shareholders'  equity or net  income  depending  on
whether the derivative  instrument  qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes
and,  if  so,  the  nature  of the  hedging  activity.  See  Note  14  for  more
information.

Concentration of Credit Risk

     The  Company's  tenants  include  national,  regional and local  retailers.
Financial  instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk
consist primarily of tenant  receivables.  The Company generally does not obtain
collateral or other security to support financial  instruments subject to credit
risk, but monitors the credit standing of tenants.

     The Company derives a substantial portion of its rental income from various
national and regional retail companies;  however,  no single tenant collectively
accounts for more than 7.0% of the Company's total revenues.

Earnings Per Share

     Basic  earnings  per share  ("EPS")  is  computed  by  dividing  net income
available to common  shareholders by the weighted average number of unrestricted
common shares  outstanding  for the period.  Diluted EPS assumes the issuance of
common stock for all potential dilutive common shares  outstanding.  The limited
partners' rights to convert their minority interest in the Operating Partnership
into shares of common stock are not dilutive (Note 9). The following  summarizes
the  impact of  potential  dilutive  common  shares on the  denominator  used to
compute earnings per share:

Stock-Based Compensation

     The  Company  accounts  for its  stock-based  compensation  plans under the
recognition and measurement  principles of Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion
No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock  Issued to  Employees"  (APB No. 25) and related
Interpretations.  No stock-based  compensation  expense related to stock options
has been reflected in net income since all options granted had an exercise price
equal to the fair value of the Company's  common stock on the date of grant. The
following  table  illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if
the Company had applied the fair value  recognition  provisions of SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to employee stock options:

Comprehensive Income

     Comprehensive  income includes all changes in  shareholders'  equity during
the  period,  except  those  resulting  from  investments  by  shareholders  and
distributions to shareholders.

Use of Estimates

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in conformity  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and  liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at


                                       61
<PAGE>

the date of the financial  statements,  and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses  during the reported  period.  Actual  results  could differ from those
estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
No. 141,  "Business  Combinations."  SFAS No. 141  modified  existing  rules for
allocating purchase price and requires that all business combinations  initiated
after June 30, 2001,  be accounted  for under the purchase  method.  The Company
allocated a portion of the purchase price of acquired  properties to leases that
were in place at the date of the  acquisition  for  properties  acquired  during
2002.

     In May 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145,  "Rescission of FASB  Statements
No.  4,  44  and  64,   Amendment  of  FASB  Statement  No.  13,  and  Technical
Corrections,"  which  rescinds  SFAS No. 4. As a result,  gains and losses  from
extinguishments of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they
meet the criteria of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 ("APB 30"). SFAS
No. 145 will be effective for the Company's  2003 fiscal year.  Any gain or loss
on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary  item in prior
periods   presented  that  does  not  meet  the  criteria  of  APB  30  will  be
reclassified.  The Company  anticipates that all  extraordinary  losses in prior
periods  will be  reclassified  as an  operating  expense  when SFAS No.  145 is
adopted on January 1, 2003.

     In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 "Accounting for Costs Associated
with  Exit or  Disposal  Activities."  SFAS No.  146  requires  that  the  costs
associated  with exit or disposal  activity be  recognized  and measured at fair
value  when the  liability  is  incurred.  The  provisions  of SFAS No.  146 are
effective for exit or disposal  activities  initiated  after  December 31, 2002.
Since the Company typically does not engage in significant  disposal activities,
the implementation of SFAS No. 146 in 2003 is not expected to have a significant
impact on the Company's reported financial results.

     In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB  Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,  an  interpretation of SFAS No. 5, 57, and
107,  and  rescission  of  FASB   Interpretation  No.  34."  The  interpretation
elaborates  on the  disclosures  to be  made  by a  guarantor  in its  financial
statements.  It also  requires a guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair
value of the obligation  undertaken in issuing the guarantee at the inception of
a  guarantee.   The  Company   adopted  the   disclosure   provisions   of  FASB
Interpretation  No.  45 in the  fourth  quarter  2002.  In  accordance  with the
interpretation,  the  Company  will  adopt  the  remaining  provisions  of  FASB
Interpretation  No. 45 effective  January 1, 2003, and does not anticipate  that
they will have a  material  effect on the  financial  position  and  results  of
operations of the Company.

     In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation  - Transition  and  Disclosure - an Amendment of FASB Statement No.
123." SFAS No. 148 provides  alternative  transition  methods for companies that
voluntarily  change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation.  SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure  requirements of
SFAS No.  123 to  require  more  prominent  and  more  frequent  disclosures  in
financial statements about the effects of stock-based compensation.

     Effective  January 1, 2003,  the Company will begin  recording  the expense
associated  with stock options in accordance  with the fair value  provisions of
SFAS No. 123. In  accordance  with the  provisions  of SFAS No. 148, the Company
will  apply  the fair  value  provisions  on a  prospective  basis for all stock
options granted after January 1, 2003.

Reclassifications

     Certain amounts in the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements have
been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

NOTE 3.  ACQUISITIONS

     The Company  includes  the  results of  operations  of real  estate  assets
acquired  in the  consolidated  statement  of  operations  from  the date of the
related acquisition.

     The Company acquired Richland Mall, located in Waco, TX, in May 2002, for a
cash purchase price of $43,250.  In May 2002, the Company  acquired  Panama City
Mall, located in Panama City, FL, for a purchase price of $45,700.  The purchase
price of  Panama  City  Mall  consisted  of (i) the  assumption  of  $40,700  of
non-recourse  mortgage debt with an interest rate of 7.30%, (ii) the issuance of
118,695  common units of the Operating  Partnership  with a fair value of $4,487
($37.80 per unit) and (iii) $458 in cash closing costs.

     The Company also entered into a ground lease in May 2002, for land adjacent
to Panama City Mall. The ground lease gives the lessor the option to require the
Company to purchase the land for $4,148  between August 1, 2003, and February 1,
2004.

     The Company acquired the remaining 21% ownership interest in Columbia Place
in Columbia,  SC in August 2002. The total  consideration of $9,875 consisted of
the  issuance  of 61,662  common  units with a fair value of $2,280  ($36.97 per
unit) and the assumption of $7,595 of debt.

     In December 2002,  the Company  acquired the remaining 35% interest in East
Towne Mall,  West Towne Mall and West Towne  Crossing,  which are all located in
Madison,  WI. The purchase  price  consisted  of the issuance of 932,669  common
units with a fair  value of  $36,411  ($39.04  per unit) and the  assumption  of
$25,618 of debt.

     In December 2002, the Company acquired Westmoreland Mall and its associated
center,  Westmoreland Crossing,  located in Greensburg,  PA, for a cash purchase
price of $112,416.

     On  January  31,  2001,  the  Company  completed  the  first  stage  of its
acquisition  of Jacobs'  interests  in 21 malls and two  associated  centers for
total  consideration of approximately  $1,204,249,  including the acquisition of
minority  interests in certain  properties.  The purchase price consisted of (i)
$125,460 in cash,  including  closing costs of approximately  $12,872,  (ii) the
assumption of $750,244 in non-recourse  mortgage debt, and (iii) the issuance of
12,056,692  special common units of the Operating  Partnership with a fair value
of $328,545 ($27.25 per unit).

     The Company closed on the second and final stage of the Jacobs' acquisition
in March 2002, by acquiring  additional interests in the joint ventures that own
the following properties:

     *    West Towne Mall,  East Towne Mall and West Towne  Crossing in Madison,
          WI (17% interest)
     *    Columbia Place in Columbia, SC (31% interest)
     *    Kentucky Oaks Mall in Paducah, KY (2% interest)

     The purchase  price of $42,519 for the  additional  interests  consisted of
$422 in cash,  the  assumption  of $24,487 of debt and the  issuance  of 499,730
special  common units with a fair value of $17,610  (weighted  average of $35.24
per unit).

     The following  unaudited pro forma  financial  information is for the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. It presents  results for the Company as if the
acquisition  of the  interests  acquired on January 31,  2001,  had  occurred on
January  1,  2000.  The  unaudited  pro  forma  financial  information  does not
represent  what the  consolidated  results of operations or financial  condition
actually  would  have  been if the  acquisition  and  related  transactions  had
occurred on January 1, 2000. The pro forma financial  information  also does not
project the  consolidated  results of operations for any future period.  The pro
forma results are as follows:

     The pro forma adjustments  include  additional (i) depreciation  expense of

31,008 common units of the Operating  Partnership valued at $949 to purchase the
remaining  50% and 25%  interests  in Madison  Square Mall and Madison  Plaza in
Huntsville, AL, respectively.

NOTE 4.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

     On January 1, 2002, the Company  adopted SFAS No. 144,  "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets." SFAS No. 144 supersedes  SFAS No.
121 and requires  that  long-lived  assets that are to be disposed of by sale be
measured  at the lower of book value or fair value less costs to sell.  SFAS No.
144 retains the  fundamental  provisions of SFAS No. 121 for (i) recognition and
measurement of the impairment of long-lived  assets to be held and used and (ii)
measurement of long-lived  assets to be disposed by sale.  SFAS No. 144 broadens
the definition of what constitutes a discontinued  operation and how the results
of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented.

     The  provisions  of  SFAS  No.  144  have  been  applied  prospectively  to
dispositions  that occurred  after January 1, 2002.  Additionally,  the disposed
assets'  results  of  operations  for 2001 and 2000  have been  reclassified  to
discontinued operations to conform to the current year presentation.

     During 2002, the Company sold five community centers and an office building
for a total  sales  price of  $36,800  and  recognized  a net  gain of $372.  In
accordance  with  SFAS No.  144,  the net gain is  reported  as a  component  of
discontinued   operations  in  the   accompanying   consolidated   statement  of
operations.  Total revenues for these properties were $2,331,  $4,844 and $3,824
in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

NOTE 5.  UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES

     At December 31, 2002,  the Company has  investments  in the following  nine
partnerships and joint ventures, which are accounted for using the equity method
of accounting:

                                       and Massard Crossing
</TABLE>

     In January 2001, the Company  acquired a 48% interest in Kentucky Oaks Mall
Company, Columbia Joint Venture and Madison Joint Venture in connection with the
first stage of the Jacobs' transaction discussed in Note 3.

     As  discussed  in Note 3, the  Company  discontinued  the equity  method of
accounting for the  partnership  that owns Madison Square Mall after the Company
acquired the remaining  ownership  interest in that  partnership  on January 31,
2001.

     In February  2002, the Company  contributed  its interests in two community
centers and one associated center to PPG Venture I Limited Partnership,  a joint
venture with a third party, and retained a 10% interest. The total consideration
of $63,030 consisted of cash of $46,000 and the Company's retained interest. The
Company  deferred  the  gain of  $10,983  from  the  transaction  since  certain
restrictions  included in the joint venture  agreement related to the subsequent
sale of the properties  demonstrate the Company's  continuing  involvement.  The
deferred gain is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

     In March 2002,  the Company  acquired an additional 2% interest in Kentucky
Oaks Mall Company,  an  additional  17% interest in Madison Joint Venture and an
additional  31% interest in Columbia  Mall Company as discussed in Note 3. Since
the additional  interest in Columbia Mall Company resulted in the Company having
a 79% controlling interest in that joint venture, the Company stopped accounting
for it using the  equity  method and began  consolidating  it as of the date the
additional 31% interest was acquired.

     During  2002,  the Company  entered  into three joint  ventures  with third
parties to develop two malls, Imperial Valley Mall and Coastal Grand.

     Condensed combined financial statement  information of the partnerships and
joint ventures is presented as follows:

                                       68
<PAGE>

     In June 2002,  the Company  completed  an offering of  2,000,000  shares of
8.75%  Series B  Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Stock  ("Series B  Preferred
Stock"),  having a par value of $.01 per share,  at $50.00  per  share.  The net
proceeds of $96,370 were used to reduce outstanding balances under the Company's

     The  dividends on the Series B Preferred  Stock are  cumulative  and accrue
from the date of issue and are payable  quarterly in arrears at a rate of $4.375
per share per annum. The Series B Preferred Stock has no stated maturity, is not

any other  securities  of the  Company.  The Series B Preferred  Stock cannot be
redeemed by the Company prior to June 14, 2007. After that date, the Company may
redeem shares,  in whole or in part, at any time for a cash redemption  price of
$50.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends.

NOTE 9.  MINORITY INTERESTS

     Minority interests represent (i) the aggregate  partnership interest in the
Operating  Partnership  that is not owned by the Company and (ii) the  aggregate
ownership  interest in 11 of the Company's  shopping  center  properties that is
held by third parties.

Minority Interest in Operating Partnership

     The minority interest in the Operating Partnership is represented by common
units and special common units of limited partnership  interest in the Operating
Partnership (the "Operating Partnership Units") that the Company does not own.

     The  assets  and  liabilities  allocated  to  the  Operating  Partnership's
minority  interest  are based on their  ownership  percentage  of the  Operating
Partnership  at  December  31,  2002  and  2001.  The  ownership  percentage  is
determined  by dividing  the number of Operating  Partnership  Units held by the
minority  interest  at  December  31,  2002  and  2001  by the  total  Operating
Partnership  Units  outstanding  at  December  31, 2002 and 2001.  The  minority
interest  ownership  percentage  in  assets  and  liabilities  of the  Operating
Partnership was 46.3% and 49.9% at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

     Income is allocated to the Operating  Partnership's minority interest based
on their weighted average ownership during the year. The ownership percentage is
determined  by dividing the  weighted  average  number of Operating  Partnership
Units held by the  minority  interest by the total  weighted  average  number of
Operating Partnership Units outstanding during the year.

     A change in the number of shares of common stock or  Operating  Partnership
Units  changes the  percentage  ownership  of both the  Operating  Partnership's
minority interest and the Company.  An Operating  Partnership Unit is considered
to be equivalent to a share of common stock since it generally is redeemable for
cash or shares of the Company's common stock. As a result, an allocation is made
between  shareholders' equity and minority interest in the Operating Partnership
in the  accompanying  balance  sheet to reflect the change in  ownership  of the
Operating  Partnership's  underlying equity when there is a change in the number
of shares and/or Operating Partnership Units outstanding.

     The total  liability  related to the  minority  interest  in the  Operating
Partnership   was   $497,832  and  $428,888  at  December  31,  2002  and  2001,
respectively.

Minority Interest in Operating Partnership-Conversion Rights

     The Operating Partnership agreement gives the limited partners the right to
convert their partnership  interests in the Operating Partnership into shares of
common stock,  subject to certain  limits.  It also gives them the right to sell
part or all of their  partnership  interest in the Operating  Partnership to the
Company in exchange  for shares of common  stock or their cash  equivalent.  The
Company  can elect to pay in shares of common  stock or their  cash  equivalent,
subject to the terms of the Operating Partnership agreement.

                                       69
<PAGE>

     The  Operating  Partnership  issued  13,159,407  special  common  units  in
connection with the  acquisitions  discussed in Notes 3 and 5. After January 31,
2004, holders of the special common units may exchange them for shares of common
stock or cash.  The  Company  has the  right to elect the form of  payment.  The
special  common  units  receive a minimum  distribution  of $2.9025 per unit per
year.  When the  distribution  on the common units exceeds  $2.9025 per unit per
year, the special common units will receive a distribution equal to that paid on
the common units.

     The Operating  Partnership issued 1,144,034 common units in connection with
the  acquisitions  discussed  in  Notes 3 and 5.  The  common  units  issued  in
connection with the acquisition of Panama City Mall,  which is discussed in Note
3, will  receive a minimum  annual  dividend  of $3.375 per unit until May 2012.
When the  distribution on the common units exceeds $3.375 per unit, these common
units  will  receive  a  distribution  equal to that paid on the  common  units.
Additionally, if the annual distribution on the common units should ever be less
than $2.22 per unit,  the $3.375 per unit dividend will be reduced by the amount
the per unit distribution is less than $2.22 per unit.

     During 2002, third parties  converted 446,652 common units to shares of the
Company's common stock.

     The Operating  Partnership  acquired  properties from CBL's  Predecessor in
exchange for 1,336 common units valued at $27,000 during 2000.

     Outstanding   rights  to  convert  minority   interests  in  the  Operating
Partnership  to common stock were held by the following  parties at December 31,
2002 and 2001:

Minority Interest in Shopping Center Properties

     The  Company's   consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  assets,
liabilities and results of operations of eleven properties that the Company does
not wholly own. The minority interest in shopping center  properties  represents
the aggregate ownership interest of third parties in these properties. The total
liability  related to the minority  interests in shopping center  properties was
$2,681 and $2,213 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

     The assets and liabilities  allocated to the minority  interest in shopping
center properties are based on the third parties' ownership  percentages in each
shopping center  property at December 31, 2002 and 2001.  Income is allocated to
the minority  interest in shopping center properties based on the third parties'
weighted average ownership in each shopping center property during the year.

NOTE 14.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to
changes  in  interest  rates.  The  Company  does not use  derivative  financial
instruments  for  speculative   purposes.   The  Company's  interest  rate  risk
management  policy  requires  that  derivative  instruments  be used for hedging
purposes  only  and  that  they  be  entered  into  only  with  major  financial
institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors.

     The Company's  objective in using  derivatives is to manage its exposure to
changes in interest rates. To accomplish this objective,  the Company  primarily
uses  interest  rate swaps and caps as part of its cash flow  hedging  strategy.
Interest  rate swaps  designated  as cash flow  hedges  involve  the  receipt of
variable-rate  amounts in exchange for fixed-rate  payments over the life of the
agreements without the exchange of the underlying principal amount. During 2002,
such  derivatives  were used to hedge the variable  cash flows  associated  with
variable-rate  debt.  Under an interest rate swap in place at December 31, 2002,
the  Company  receives  interest  payments  at a rate  equal to LIBOR  (1.44% at
December 31, 2002) and pays interest at a fixed rate of 5.83%. The interest rate
swap has a notional amount of $80,000 and expires August 30, 2003.

     Effective January 1, 2001, the Company  determined that, with the exception
of two swap  agreements  that  expired  during the first  quarter  of 2001,  the
Company's  derivative   instruments  were  effective  and  qualified  for  hedge
accounting in accordance  with SFAS No. 133. At December 31, 2002,  the interest
rate  swap's fair value of $2,412 was  recorded in accounts  payable and accrued
liabilities.

     The unrealized  gains/losses  recorded in accumulated  other  comprehensive
loss will be reclassified to earnings as interest expense when interest payments
are made. This reclassification  correlates with the timing of when hedged items
are recognized in earnings.  The change in net unrealized  gains/losses  on cash
flow hedges in 2002 reflects a reclassification  of net unrealized  gains/losses
from accumulated other  comprehensive  loss to interest expense in the amount of
$4,387.  The remaining  unrealized  gains/losses  of $2,397 will be reclassified
during 2003.

     The Company is exposed to credit  losses if the  counterparty  is unable to
perform under the interest rate swap agreement. However, the Company anticipates
that the  counterparty  will be able to fully satisfy its obligations  under the
contract.  The Company does not obtain  collateral or other  security to support
financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of
counterparties.

NOTE 15.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     CBL's  Predecessor  and certain  officers of the Company have a significant
minority interest in the construction  company that the Company engaged to build
substantially all of the Company's  properties.  The Company paid  approximately
$96,185,  $94,300 and $123,000 to the  construction  company in 2002,  2001, and
2000,  respectively,  for construction and development services. The Company had
accounts payable to the  construction  company of $16,963 and $3,109 at December
31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

     The Management  Company  provides  management  and leasing  services to the
Company's unconsolidated affiliates and other affiliated partnerships.  Revenues
recognized  for these  services  amounted to $2,502,  $1,450 and $1,166 in 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

NOTE 16.  CONTINGENCIES

     The Company is currently  involved in certain litigation that arises in the
ordinary  course  of  business.  It is  management's  opinion  that the  pending
litigation  will not  materially  affect the  financial  position  or results of
operations of the Company.  Additionally,  management  believes  that,  based on
environmental  studies completed to date, any exposure to environmental  cleanup
will not materially  affect the financial  position and results of operations of
the Company.

     The  Company  has  guaranteed  all  of the  construction  debt  related  to
Waterford  Commons,  which is owned in a joint  venture  with a third party that
owns  a  minority  interest.  The  total  amount  of  the  commitment  for  this
construction  loan is $30,000,  of which $7,182 was  outstanding at December 31,
2002.  The Company will  receive a fee from the third party  partner in exchange
for the guaranty,  which will be recognized as revenue pro rata over the term of
the guaranty. The fee had not been received as of December 31, 2002.

     The  Company  has  guaranteed  50% of the debt of Parkway  Place  L.P.,  an
unconsolidated  affiliate  in which the Company owns a 45%  interest.  The total
amount  outstanding at December 31, 2002, was $56,458,  of which the Company has
guaranteed $28,229.

     Under  the terms of the  partnership  agreement  of Mall of South  Carolina
L.P., an unconsolidated  affiliate in which the Company owns a 50% interest, the
Company will guarantee 100% of the construction debt incurred to develop Coastal
Grand.  There was no  construction  debt  outstanding  at December 31, 2002. The
Company will receive a fee for this guarantee.

NOTE 17.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The carrying  values of cash and cash  equivalents,  receivables,  accounts
payable and accrued  liabilities  are reasonable  estimates of their fair values
because  of the short  maturity  of these  financial  instruments.  Based on the
interest rates for similar financial instruments, the carrying value of mortgage
notes  receivable is a reasonable  estimation  of fair value.  The fair value of
mortgage and other notes payable was  $2,637,219  and $2,315,472 at December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively. The fair value was calculated by discounting future
cash flows for the notes  payable using  estimated  rates at which similar loans
would be made currently.

NOTE 18.  STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

     The Company  maintains  the CBL & Associates  Properties,  Inc.  1993 Stock
Incentive Plan, as amended, which permits the Company to issue stock options and
common stock to selected officers,  employees and directors of the Company.  The
shares  available  under the plan were  increased  from  4,000,000  to 5,200,000
during  2002.  The  Compensation  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (the
"Committee") administers the plan.

Stock Options

     Stock options  issued under the plan allow for the purchase of common stock
at the fair  market  value of the  stock on the  date of  grant.  Stock  options
granted to officers and employees vest and become exercisable in installments on
each of the first  five  anniversaries  of the date of grant and expire 10 years
after the date of grant.  Stock  options  granted to  independent  directors are
fully vested upon grant. However, the independent directors may not sell, pledge
or otherwise  transfer  their stock  options  during their board term or for one
year thereafter.

Stock Awards

     Under the plan,  common stock may be awarded either alone,  in addition to,
or in tandem with other stock awards  granted under the plan.  The Committee has
the  authority  to  determine  eligible  persons  to whom  common  stock will be
awarded,  the number of shares to be  awarded,  and the  duration of the vesting
period,  as defined.  The  Committee may also provide for the issuance of common
stock  under the plan on a deferred  basis  pursuant  to  deferred  compensation
arrangements, as described in Note 19.

     During  2002,  the  Company  issued  73,228  shares of common  stock with a
weighted  average  grant-date fair value of $35.21 per share.  There were 41,516
shares that vested  immediately.  The  remaining  31,712  shares vest at various
dates from 2003 to 2007.

     During  2001,  the  Company  issued  69,735  shares of common  stock with a
weighted  average  grant-date fair value of $27.62 per share.  There were 44,537
shares of common stock that vested  immediately.  The remaining 25,198 shares of
common stock vest at various dates from 2002 to 2006.

     During  2000,  the  Company  issued  72,329  shares of common  stock with a

shares of common stock that vested  immediately.  The remaining 35,723 shares of

NOTE 19.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

401 (k) Plan

     The Management  Company  maintains a 401(k) profit  sharing plan,  which is
qualified under Section 401(a) and Section 401(k) of the Code to cover employees
of the  Management  Company.  All  employees who have attained the age of 21 and
have  completed at least one year of service are eligible to  participate in the
plan. The plan provides for employer  matching  contributions  on behalf of each
participant equal to 50% of the portion of such participant's  contribution that
does not  exceed  2.5% of such  participant's  compensation  for the plan  year.


                                       75
<PAGE>

Additionally,  the  Management  Company has the  discretion  to make  additional
profit-sharing-type   contributions   not   related  to   participant   elective
contributions. Total contributions by the Management Company were $439, $391 and
$323 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

     The Company  maintains an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible
employees  to acquire  shares of the  Company's  common stock in the open market
without  incurring  brokerage  or  transaction  fees.  Under the plan,  eligible
employees  make  payroll  deductions  that are used to  purchase  shares  of the
Company's  common stock.  The shares are purchased by the fifth  business day of
the month following the month when the deductions were withheld.  The shares are
purchased at the prevailing market price of the stock at the time of purchase.

Deferred Compensation Arrangements

     The Company has entered into  agreements  with certain of its officers that
allow the officers to defer receipt of selected  salary  increases  and/or bonus
compensation for periods ranging from 5 to 10 years.

     For certain officers,  the deferred compensation  arrangements provide that
when the salary increase or bonus compensation is earned and deferred, shares of
the Company's  common stock  issuable  under the 1993 Stock  Incentive  Plan are
deemed set aside for the amount deferred.  The number of shares deemed set aside
is determined by dividing the amount of compensation  deferred by the fair value
of  the  Company's  common  stock  on  the  deferral  date,  as  defined  in the
arrangements. The shares set aside are deemed to receive dividends equivalent to
those paid on the Company's common stock, which are then deemed to be reinvested
in the  Company's  common  stock  in  accordance  with  the  Company's  dividend
reinvestment plan. When an arrangement terminates, the Company will issue shares
of the Company's common stock to the officer  equivalent to the number of shares
deemed to have accumulated under the officer's arrangement. At December 31, 2002
and 2001, respectively, there were 80,532 and 65,200 shares that were deemed set
aside in accordance with these arrangements.

     For other officers,  the deferred  compensation  arrangements  provide that
their  bonus  compensation  is  deferred  in the form of a note  payable  to the
officer.  Interest  accumulates  on these  notes at  7.0%.  When an  arrangement
terminates,  the note payable  plus  accrued  interest is paid to the officer in
cash.  At  December  31,  2002 and 2001,  respectively,  the  Company  had notes
payable,  including  accrued  interest,  of  $319  and  $168  related  to  these
arrangements.

NOTE 20.  DIVIDENDS

     On October 29,  2002,  the Company  declared a cash  dividend of $0.655 per
share for the quarter ended  December 31, 2002. The dividend was paid on January
15, 2003, to  shareholders of record as of December 27, 2002. The total dividend
of $19,517 is included in accounts  payable and accrued  liabilities at December
31, 2002.

     On January 15, 2002,  the  Operating  Partnership  paid a  distribution  of
$17,336 to the  Operating  Partnership's  limited  partners.  This  distribution
represented  a  distribution  of $0.655 per unit for each common unit and $0.726
per unit for each special  common unit in the Operating  Partnership.  The total
distribution is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December
31, 2002.

NOTE 21.  QUARTERLY INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

     The  following  quarterly  information  differs  from  previously  reported

subsequent to each quarter end in 2002 have been  reclassified  to  discontinued
operations for all periods presented.  Additionally, total revenues differs from
previously  reported  amounts due to a  reclassification  made to conform to the
fourth quarter and year-end presentations.

                                   SCHEDULE A

                          Description of the Interests

     One Hundred and  Eighteen  Thousand Six Hundred and  Ninety-Five  (118,695)
Common Units as are described  more fully in, and are subject to the  provisions
of the OP Agreement as same may be amended from time to time.

     Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained  in the OP  Agreement,
until  the  earlier  to  occur  of (i)  the  tenth  anniversary  of the  closing
hereunder,  or (ii) the cash  distributions by the Partnership on account of its
Common  Units  during any  consecutive  four  calendar  quarters  is equal to or
greater  than  $3.375  per  Common  Unit (each a  "Termination  Event"),  if the
quarterly distribution by the Partnership on account of its Common Units is less
than $.84375 per Common Unit (the "Basic  Distribution"),  then the  Partnership
shall,  to the  extent of its  available  cash flow and after  distributions  on
account of any preferred  and senior  securities  of the  Partnership  and after
distributions   to  the  Series  J  Special   Common  Units  but  prior  to  any
distributions to the Common Units, make a special distribution on account of the
Common Units held by Contributor  equal to the difference  between the amount of
the Basic Distribution and the amount distributed on account of all Common Units
(the "Special  Distribution"),  provided  however,  that the amount of a Special
Distribution shall never exceed $.28875 per Common Unit in any calendar quarter.
Each  Special  Distribution  shall be paid in  conjunction  with the  payment of
regular  quarterly  distributions  on account of the Common Units. The foregoing
amounts shall be adjusted to reflect any splits,  reverse splits,  distributions
of Common  Units or  similar  adjustments  to the  amount  of the  Partnership's
outstanding  Common Units and, prior to any Termination  Event, the Common Units
being  received  by  Contributor  as  described   herein  shall  be  treated  no
differently  (except for the provisions set forth above as to distributions  and
any special tax allocations  described herein and in the Contribution  Agreement
as  applicable  to the  Contributor's  Common  Units) than any other Common Unit
(other  than the Series J Special  Common  Units)  that may exist on the date of
this instrument.

     Certain Income Allocations.  Contributor and the Partnership agree that the
Partnership  shall allocate taxable income to Contributor in each fiscal year in
an amount equivalent to the cash distributions made to Contributor in respect of
its  Partnership  Interests  during such fiscal year of the  Partnership  (i.e.,
"income to follow cash"). Contributor and the Partnership also agree that except
for the allocations of the 704(c) Tax Items referenced in Paragraph 18.1.1(b) of
the  Contribution  Agreement,  the  impact  of the  Code  Section  754  election
referenced  in Paragraph  18.1.3 of the  Contribution  Agreement  and the income
allocations  referenced herein and as modified by the  next-following  sentence,
the  Partnership  Interests  of  Contributor  shall be  treated,  for all  other
purposes of allocations of income,  gain, loss, deduction or credit, in the same
manner as the other  Common  Units of the  Partnership  as  "Common  Units"  are
defined in OP Agreement.  Notwithstanding  the preceding sentence but except for
the allocations of the 704(c) Tax Items referenced in Paragraph 18.1.1(b) of the
Contribution  Agreement  and  the  impact  of  the  Code  Section  754  election
referenced in Paragraph 18.1.3 of the Contribution Agreement,  Contributor shall
be allocated  income and/or gain for a fiscal year of the  Partnership in excess
of the cash distributions that Contributor has received from the Partnership for
such  fiscal  year if and  only if (i) all  other  Common  Unit  holders  of the
Partnership  have  received an income and/or gain  allocation  equivalent to the
cash  distributions  that such  other  Common  Unit  holders  received  from the
Partnership for such fiscal year, and (ii) such allocation of income and/or gain
to Contributor  is in an amount  equivalent to  Contributor's  pro rata portion,
based on  Contributor's  Partnership  Interest,  of the  aggregate of the income
and/or gain  remaining  after the other Common Unit holders have been  allocated
income and/or gain in an amount equivalent to the cash  distributions  that they
received for such fiscal year.

                                       96
<PAGE>

          By way of illustration  only, the Partnership's  dividend for a fiscal
          year is $2.50/Unit  and  Contributor  has received  $3.375/unit on its
          Partnership  Interest but the additional  income,  after allocation of
          $3.375/unit  to the  Contributor,  to be  allocated to all Common Unit
          holders is  $2.60/Unit.  For such fiscal  year,  Contributor  shall be
          allocated  income  equivalent  to  $3.375/Unit,  the other Common Unit
          holders shall be allocated  income  equivalent  to $2.50/unit  and the
          balance  of the  income  ($.10/unit)  to be  allocated  shall  then be
          allocated to all Common Unit holders (including  Contributor) on a pro
          rata or per unit basis.

     Concurrently  with,  or  promptly  following,  the closing  hereunder,  the
Partnership  shall  cause  the  OP  Agreement  to  be  amended  to  reflect  the
arrangements hereunder.

employment.  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,  "Cause"  shall  mean  (i)  the
conviction  of the Optionee for  commission of a felony under Federal law or the
law of the state in which such action occurred, (ii) dishonesty in the course of
fulfilling  the  Optionee's  employment  duties or (iii) willful and  deliberate
failure on the part of the  Optionee  to perform  his  employment  duties in any
material respect.

     (d) Other  Termination.  Unless  otherwise  determined by the  Compensation
Committee of the Company's Board of Directors,  if the Optionee's  employment is
terminated for any reason other than death, disability, retirement or for Cause,
the Option shall thereupon terminate, except that the Option, to the extent then
exercisable,  may be  exercised  by the  Optionee for the lesser of one (1) year
from the date of such  termination  of  employment  or the  balance of the Term;
provided,  however,  that if the Optionee dies within such one-year period,  any
unexercised portion of the Option shall,  notwithstanding the expiration of such
one-year  period,  continue  to be  exercisable  to the  extent  to which it was
exercisable  at the time of death  for a period of one (1) year from the date of
such death or until the expiration of the Term, whichever period is the shorter.

     7. No Rights  as a  Shareholder.  The  Optionee  shall  have no rights as a
shareholder  with  respect  to any  shares of  Common  Stock  issuable  upon the
exercise  of the  Option  until  the  date  of  issuance  to the  Optionee  of a
certificate  evidencing such shares of Common Stock. No adjustments,  other than
as provided in Section 3 of the Plan,  shall be made for dividends  (ordinary or
extraordinary,  whether in cash,  securities or other property) or distributions
for which the record date is prior to the date the  certificate  for such shares
of Common Stock is issued.

     8. Method of Exercising Option. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement,  the Option may be  exercised  by  written  notice to the  Compliance
Officer at the  Company's  principal  executive  offices  located at CBL Center,

Such notice  shall state the  election to exercise  the Option and the number of
shares of Common Stock in respect of which the Option is being exercised,  shall
be signed  by the  person or  persons  so  exercising  the  Option  and shall be
accompanied  by payment in full of the Purchase  Price for such shares of Common
Stock  (the  "Exercise  Price").  The  Exercise  Price  shall be paid in full by
Optionee's  personal check payable to the order of the Company.  Subject to such
procedures  and rules as may be  adopted  from time to time by the  Compensation
Committee of the Company's  Board of Directors,  the Exercise  Price may also be
paid by one or more of the  following:  (i) in the form of  unrestricted  Common
Stock  already  owned by the  Optionee  based in any such  instance  on the Fair
Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the Option is exercised; or (ii) by
any combination of the methods of payment described in this paragraph.

     The certificate for the shares of Common Stock as to which the Option shall
have been so exercised  shall be registered in the name of the person or persons
so exercising the Option. All shares of Common Stock purchased upon the exercise
of the Option as provided herein shall be fully paid and non-assessable.

     9.  Non-transferability  of Option. The Option shall not be transferable by
the Optionee other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  The
Option  shall  be  exercisable,  during  the  Optionee's  lifetime,  only by the
Optionee or by the guardian or legal  representative  of the Optionee,  it being
understood that the terms "holder" and "Optionee" include the guardian and legal
representative  of the Optionee and any person to whom the Option is transferred
by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

     10. Cashing Out of Option.  On receipt of written  notice of exercise,  the
Compensation  Committee  of the Board of  Directors  of the Company may elect to
cash out all or any part of the  shares of Common  Stock for which the Option is
being exercised by paying the Optionee an amount, in cash or Common Stock, equal
to the excess of the Fair  Market  Value of the Common  Stock over the  Purchase
Price  times the number of shares of Common  Stock for which the Option is being
exercised on the effective date of such cash out.

     Cash outs  pursuant to this  Section,  provided the Optionee is actually or
potentially  subject to Section  16(b) of the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934,
shall comply with the "window period" provisions of Rule 16b-3(e), to the extent
applicable.

     11. No Enlargement of Employee  Rights.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to confer upon the Optionee  any right to continued  employment  or to
restrict in any way the right of the Company or any  Subsidiary  or Affiliate to
terminate his employment at any time.

     12. Income Tax Withholding. The Company shall make such provisions and take
such steps as it may deem  necessary or appropriate  for the  withholding of all
Federal,  state,  local and other  taxes  required  by law to be  withheld  with
respect to the  exercise of the Option and the  issuance of the shares of Common
Stock,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  deducting  the  amount  of any  such
withholding  taxes  from any other  amounts  then or  thereafter  payable to the
Optionee by the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries or Affiliates,  or requiring
the Optionee, or the beneficiary or legal representative of the Optionee, to pay
to the Company the amount  required to be withheld or to execute such  documents
as the  Company  deems  necessary  or  desirable  to  enable it to  satisfy  its
withholding obligations.

     13.  Non-Qualified  Option. The Option granted hereunder is not intended to
be an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.

     14.  Binding  Effect.  This  Agreement  shall be  binding  upon the  heirs,
executors, administrators and successors of the parties hereto.

     15.  Governing  Law. This Agreement  shall be construed and  interpreted in
accordance  with the laws of the  State of  Delaware  without  reference  to the
principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

     16.  Headings.  Headings are for the convenience of the parties and are not
deemed to be part of this Agreement.

     IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of
the date and year first written above.

day of  ________,  _____,  by and between CBL & ASSOCIATES  PROPERTIES,  INC., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and ______________ (the "Employee").

     WHEREAS, pursuant to the Plan (as hereinafter defined), the Company desires

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in connection with the mutual  covenants  hereinafter set
forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of
which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1. Definitions; Conflicts. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined
herein  shall  have  the  meanings  ascribed  thereto  in the  CBL &  Associates
Properties,  Inc.  1993  Stock  Incentive  Plan  (the  "Plan").  The  terms  and
provisions of the Plan are incorporated  herein and in the event of any conflict
or inconsistency  between the terms and provisions of the Plan and the terms and
provisions of this Agreement,  the terms and provisions of the Plan shall govern
and control.

     2. Grant of Common  Stock.  The Company  hereby  grants to the Employee all
right, title and interest in ________ shares of Common Stock (the "Stock Award")
on the terms and conditions herein set forth.

     3. Vesting.  The Common Stock Award shall vest upon the earlier to occur of
(i)  the  events  described  in  Paragraph  4  (a),  (b) or (c)  below  or  (ii)
_____________ (the "Vesting  Period").  No portion of the Stock Award shall vest
until such time. As used in this  Agreement,  the term "vest" or "vesting" shall
mean the immediate, non-forfeitable,  fixed right of present or future enjoyment
of the Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Award.

     4. Termination of Employment.

     (a) Termination by Death. If the Employee's  employment terminates prior to
____________________  by reason  of  death,  the  Stock  Award  shall  thereupon

such  reasonable  written  policies,  rules  or  standards  of  conduct  for the
Company's  Employees as have been  previously  established  by the Company,  the
violation of which amounts to gross  disruption or obstruction of the conducting
of the Company's business, after written notice to cease such violation thereof.

                                      112
<PAGE>

     (d) Other  Termination.  Unless  otherwise  determined by the  Compensation
Committee of the Company's Board of Directors,  if the Employee's  employment is
terminated  prior to  __________________  for any  reason  other  than  death or
disability or by the Company  without cause,  the Stock Award shall thereupon be
deemed  forfeited  and all  shares  of Common  Stock  shall be  returned  by the
Employee to the  Company and the  Employee  shall have no further  right,  title
and/or interest in the Common Stock which was the subject of the Stock Award.

     5. Rights as a Shareholder.  The Employee shall have all of the rights as a
shareholder  with respect to any shares of Common  Stock issued  pursuant to the
Stock Award subject only to the transfer  restrictions  set forth in Paragraph 6
below.  The  Employee's  rights as a  shareholder  shall  include  the rights to
receive all  dividends  on the Common  Stock and to exercise  any voting  rights
attributable to the Common Stock.

     6.   Non-Transferability  of  Stock  Award.  Except  for  transfers  to  an
Employee's spouse,  lineal  descendants or ascendants,  no portion of the Common
Stock making up the Stock Award may be transferred by the Employee other than by
will or by the laws of descent and  distribution  until the  termination  of the
Vesting Period and any non-permitted attempted transfer by the Employee prior to
the  termination  of the  Vesting  Period  shall be null and void.  The  vesting
provisions and forfeiture  requirements  outlined in Paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be
applicable to any or all of a Stock Award that may be transferred in a permitted
transfer as if the Employee had not  transferred  any portion of the Stock Award
and any recipient pursuant to a permitted transfer shall be bound by and subject
to said vesting provisions and forfeiture requirements.

     7.  Certificate  Legend.  All shares of Common Stock issued to the Employee
pursuant to the Stock Award shall bear the legend  stating  that said shares are
subject to and their  transferability  restricted by the terms and provisions of
this  Agreement.  The Company  agrees to remove said legend from the  referenced
shares of Common Stock in the event and at the time the Employee's right to said
shares of Common Stock shall vest.

     8. No Enlargement of Employee  Rights.  Nothing in this Agreement  shall be
construed to confer upon the Employee  any right to continued  employment  or to
restrict in any way the right of the Company or any  Subsidiary  or Affiliate to
terminate his employment at any time.

     9. Income Tax Withholding.  The Company shall make such provisions and take
such steps as it may deem  necessary or appropriate  for the  withholding of all
Federal,  state,  local and other  taxes  required  by law to be  withheld  with
respect  to the  shares of Common  Stock  issued  pursuant  to the Stock  Award,
including,  but not limited  to,  deducting  the amount of any such  withholding
taxes from any other amounts then or  thereafter  payable to the Employee by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates,  or requiring the Employee, or
the beneficiary or legal  representative of the Employee,  to pay to the Company
the amount  required to be withheld or to execute such  documents as the Company
deems   necessary  or  desirable  to  enable  it  to  satisfy  its   withholding
obligations.

     10. Restricted Stock. The Stock Award granted hereunder is intended to be a
grant of restricted  property to the Employee that is subject to a  "substantial
risk of forfeiture" as defined in Section 83 of the Code.

     11.  Binding  Effect.  This  Agreement  shall be  binding  upon the  heirs,
executors, administrators and successors of the parties hereto.

     12.  Governing  Law. This Agreement  shall be construed and  interpreted in
accordance  with the laws of the  State of  Delaware  without  reference  to the

                                                               Exhibit 10.5.4

                        DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENT

     THIS DEFERRED COMPENSATION  ARRANGEMENT (the "Arrangement") is put in place
this 1st day of  January,  1997 by CBL &  Associates  Management,  Inc.  and its
affiliated entities  (collectively,  "CBL"),  including but not limited to CBL &
Associates   Properties,   Inc.  (the  "REIT")  and  CBL  &  Associates  Limited
Partnership (the "Operating  Partnership") and their successors and assigns, for
the benefit of Eric P. Snyder  ("Snyder") and his  successors  and assigns.  The
Arrangement  is  specifically  designed  and  intended  to be a  non-funded  and
unsecured  promise on the part of CBL to make certain  payments to Snyder within
the time parameters set forth herein.  The Arrangement is not intended nor shall
it be deemed an employee benefit plan subject to the Employee  Retirement Income
Security  Act of 1974  ("ERISA")  or a  qualified  retirement  plan  subject  to
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code").

     1.  Objective.  The  objective and purpose of the  Arrangement  is to allow
Snyder to defer  compensation  which will be payable to him in the future as set
forth herein.  Pursuant to the elections provided to Snyder in this Arrangement,
he may defer  portions of his salary from CBL and certain  bonuses to be paid to
him to dates in the future as set forth herein.

     2. Creditor Status.  Snyder shall be afforded no priority by virtue of this
Arrangement  over the  secured  or  unsecured  creditors  of CBL but  shall be a
general  unsecured  creditor of CBL as to the amounts  payable to him under this
Arrangement.  CBL's  obligations  under this  Arrangement are merely promises to
make the payments  set forth  herein at a future point in time  pursuant to this
Arrangement.  Such  payments  shall not be  pre-funded or secured in any way and
shall be payable only from the general assets of CBL.

     3.  Elections.  Prior to the  beginning  of any period for which Snyder may
earn  compensation or bonuses from CBL, Snyder shall notify CBL of his desire to
have all or any portion of said amounts deferred and paid to him pursuant to the
terms of this  Arrangement.  Snyder has  elected to defer any and all bonuses he
may  receive  from CBL for 1997 and later  years  pursuant  to the terms of this
Arrangement. Snyder has elected to receive a base annual salary of $220,700 from
CBL for the period of this Arrangement  with any additional  amounts to which he
is or may become entitled to be paid pursuant to the terms of this  Arrangement.
Snyder may change or modify this election,  including reducing the amount of the
base salary  referred to above,  at any time by notice to CBL but must give such
notice  prior to the  beginning  of the period with  respect to which Snyder may
earn the compensation or bonuses from CBL.

     4. Specific Calculation of Amounts,  Vesting and Deemed Returns. (a) Salary
Increases.  On any specific  salary increase to which Snyder may be entitled and
for which Snyder has elected to defer pursuant to this  Arrangement,  the dollar
amount  of the  salary  increase  shall be  determined  by CBL as of the date of
Snyder's  annual  review by CBL. Said amount shall then be divided into 12 equal
amounts which shall vest in equal monthly  increments over the period  beginning
October 1 of any given year and  terminating  on September  30 of the  following
year (the "Vesting Period").  At the end of each month of the Vesting Period, an
amount of REIT stock shall be deemed to be set aside for Snyder pursuant to this
Arrangement  equal to the amount of REIT stock that could have been purchased by
Snyder  with the  amount of the  salary  increase  that vests at the end of that
particular  month at the closing trading price of the REIT stock on the New York
Stock Exchange  ("NYSE") on the last trading day of the particular  month.  Over
the course of the Vesting  Period,  there shall be added to the deemed amount of
stock referred to above an amount  equivalent to additional shares of REIT stock
that may have been purchased by the  reinvestment  of dividends paid by the REIT
on its stock for the Vesting Period under the REIT's Dividend  Reinvestment Plan
(the "DRIP") as if dividends had been paid on the stock Snyder is deemed to have
received over the Vesting Period.  At the end of the Vesting Period,  the amount
of shares of REIT stock that  Snyder has been deemed to have  received  over the
Vesting  Period shall be determined and that amount of shares shall be deemed to
be set aside for Snyder pursuant to this Arrangement and there shall be added to


                                      115
<PAGE>

that amount of shares an amount  equivalent to  additional  shares of REIT stock
that may have been purchased by the  reinvestment  of dividends paid by the REIT
on its stock  pursuant to the DRIP for the period of time  following the Vesting
Period to the termination date of this Arrangement.

     (b)  Bonuses.  On any bonus that  Snyder may be entitled to receive and for
which  Snyder has  elected to defer  pursuant  to this  Arrangement,  the dollar
amount of the bonus shall be determined by CBL as of the date of the granting of
the bonus by CBL. Following that determination, an amount of REIT stock shall be
deemed to be set aside for  Snyder  pursuant  to this  Arrangement  equal to the
amount of REIT stock that could have been purchased by Snyder with the amount of
the bonus at the closing trading price of the REIT stock on the NYSE on the date
the bonus is granted to Snyder. There shall be added to that amount of shares an
amount  equivalent  to  additional  shares  of REIT  stock  that may  have  been
purchased  by the  reinvestment  of  dividends  paid by the  REIT  on its  stock
pursuant to the DRIP for the period of time  following  the date of the granting
of the bonus to the termination date of this Arrangement.

     5. Termination of Arrangement. (a) This Arrangement shall be terminated and
all vested  amounts  herein  shall be due and payable to Snyder,  in the form of
cash and  shares of  registered,  freely  tradable,  non-restricted  REIT  stock
("Unrestricted  REIT  Stock") as set forth in  subsection  (e)  below,  upon the

          where CBL is not the surviving entity;

     (iv) January 2, 2005.

     (b) For terminations of this Arrangement by virtue of the occurrence of any
of the events listed in subsection (a)(ii) above on or before June 30 in a given
year,   Snyder  shall  receive  the  Unrestricted  REIT  Stock  payable  to  him
immediately  after such termination and shall receive the amount of cash payable
to him (as set forth in  subsection  (e)  below)  within 30 days of the date of
termination. For terminations of this Arrangement by virtue of the occurrence of
any of the events  listed in  subsection  (a)(ii)  above on or after July 1 of a
given year,  then Snyder  shall  receive  any  Unrestricted  REIT Stock and cash
payable to him on January 1 of the year following the year of termination.

     (c) For terminations of this Arrangement by virtue of the occurrence of any
of the events listed in subsection (iii) above, the amounts to be paid to Snyder
shall be paid to him in the form of cash and Unrestricted REIT stock, on January

termination of this Arrangement occurred.

     (d) For terminations of this Arrangement by virtue of the occurrence of any
of the events listed in subsection  (a)(i) and (a)(iv) above,  the amounts to be
paid to Snyder shall be paid to him, in the form of cash and  Unrestricted  REIT
stock,  within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the event giving rise to
the termination of this Arrangement.

     (e) The amount of cash  payable to Snyder  under this  Section 5 shall be a
cash amount equal to the fair market value of the number of shares of REIT stock
deemed to be set aside for Snyder as of the date of payment subject to a maximum
of One Million  Dollars  ($1,000,000) in cash.  Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary  provided  herein,  the  amount of cash to be paid to Snyder  shall not
exceed  $1,000,000.00.  Any amounts due Snyder under this Agreement in excess of
$1,000,000 shall be paid in the form of shares of Unrestricted REIT stock.

                                      116

     6.  Restriction  on Transfer of  Snyder's  Rights.  During the term of this
Arrangement,  Snyder may not  transfer,  pledge,  alienate,  assign or otherwise
dispose of all or any of his rights under this Arrangement.

     7. Income Tax Recognition and Corresponding  Compensation Deduction. At the
termination  of the  Arrangement  and payment of the amounts set forth herein to
Snyder,  Snyder shall recognize ordinary taxable income upon his receipt of same

amount.

     8. Accredited  Investor Status;  Representations.  Snyder acknowledges that
his interests  under this  Arrangement may be considered a security for purposes
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities  Acts"), and that CBL
has not filed and will not file any  registration  statement  in respect of such
interests,  and that CBL is relying on Snyder's representation in this Section 8
in order to qualify  the  offering  of such  securities  (if the  interests  are
considered as securities) for exemption from  registration  under the Securities
Act. Snyder hereby  represents and warrants that he is an "Accredited  Investor"

     (d) This  Arrangement  shall not be construed in any fashion as a guarantee
or assurance by CBL of the price or value of the REIT stock and whether it shall
fluctuate positively or negatively during the course of this Arrangement.

effective as of the date first above written.

Re:      Clarification of Deferred Compensation Arrangement Payout Terms

Dear Eric,

     This  letter  is  to  clarify  Paragraph  5 of  the  Deferred  Compensation
Arrangement  between you and CBL & Associates  Management,  Inc. and  affiliates
("CBL")  dated as of  January  1, 1997  (the  "Arrangement").  Pursuant  to that
Paragraph,  upon the  payment to you of the amount of stock  deferred  under the
Arrangement, you are to receive the sum of $1,000,000 in cash and the balance in
the form of Unrestricted  REIT Stock, as defined in the  Arrangement.  By way of
clarification  as to this Paragraph 5, upon the date that amounts are to be paid
out to you under the  Arrangement  (the  "Payment  Date"),  CBL shall deliver or
cause to be  delivered to you the total  number of shares of  Unrestricted  REIT
Stock as per the Arrangement  with no reduction for the $1,000,000 cash portion.
At your  option,  you may either  sell that number of shares to provide you with
the  $1,000,000  cash as set forth in the  Arrangement or CBL will assist you in
selling that number of shares so as to provide you with the  $1,000,000 in cash.
Whether  you  elect to have CBL  assist  you in this  sale,  CBL will  cover the
transaction costs and expenses of such sale up to a maximum of $5,000.

     For purposes of the  Arrangement  and by our mutual  execution  hereof,  we
agree that the Arrangement  shall be construed to provide that the entire amount
that  shall be due to you on a Payment  Date is to be paid to you in CBL  stock,
regardless of any vagueness or contrary  statement in the Arrangement and to the
extent  the  terms of this  letter  agreement  conflict  with  the  terms of the
Arrangement, the terms of this letter agreement shall control.

     Please  execute  both  copies  of this  letter  agreement  signifying  your
agreement to the  clarification  of the  Arrangement  that is set forth  herein.
Retain  one  fully-executed  counterpart  for your  files and  return  the other
counterpart to Jeff Curry.

Thank you for your attention and cooperation in this matter.

Sincerely,


CBL & Associates Management, Inc., for itself and affiliates
