     CAUTIONARY  STATEMENT  RELEVANT  TO  FORWARD-LOOKING  INFORMATION  FOR  THE
PURPOSE OF THE "SAFE  HARBOR"  PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE  SECURITIES  LITIGATION
REFORM ACT OF 1995


     Certain  statements made in this section or elsewhere in this report may be
deemed "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities
laws.   Although  the  Company  believes  the  expectations   reflected  in  any
forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions,  the Company can
give no assurance that these  expectations will be attained,  and it is possible
that  actual  results  may  differ  materially  from  those  indicated  by these
forward-looking  statements  due to a variety of risks and  uncertainties.  Such
risks and uncertainties include, without limitation,  general industry, economic
and  business  conditions,  interest  rate  fluctuations,  costs of capital  and
capital  requirements,  availability  of real estate  properties,  inability  to
consummate  acquisition  opportunities,  competition  from other  companies  and
retail formats,  changes in retail rental rates in the Company's markets, shifts
in customer demands,  tenant bankruptcies or store closings,  changes in vacancy
rates at the Company's  properties,  changes in operating  expenses,  changes in
applicable laws,  rules and  regulations,  the ability to obtain suitable equity
and/or debt financing and the continued availability of financing in the amounts
and on the terms necessary to support the Company's future business. The Company
disclaims any obligation to update or revise any  forward-looking  statements to
reflect actual results or changes in the factors  affecting the  forward-looking
information.


                                    Part I.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Background

     CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. (the "Company") was organized on July 13,
1993, as a Delaware corporation, to acquire substantially all of the real estate
properties  owned  by  CBL  &  Associates,  Inc.,  and  its  affiliates  ("CBL's
Predecessor"),  which was formed by Charles B.  Lebovitz in 1978. On November 3,
1993,  the Company  completed an initial  public  offering (the  "Offering")  of
15,400,000  shares of its common stock (the "Common Stock").  Simultaneous  with
the completion of the Offering, CBL's Predecessor transferred  substantially all
of its  interests  in its real estate  properties  to CBL &  Associates  Limited
Partnership  (the  "Operating  Partnership")  in  exchange  for common  units of
limited  partnership  interest in the Operating  Partnership.  CBL's Predecessor
also acquired an additional  interest in the  Operating  Partnership  for a cash
payment.  The interests in the Operating  Partnership contain certain conversion
rights that are more fully  described  in Note 9 to the  consolidated  financial
statements.


RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     On April 30, 2003,  the Company  acquired  Sunrise Mall and its  associated
center,  Sunrise  Commons,  which are  located  in  Brownsville,  TX.  The total
purchase  price of $80.7  million  consisted  of $40.7  million  in cash and the
assumption of $40.0 million of variable-rate debt.

     On August 22, 2003, the Company  issued  4,600,000  depositary  shares in a
public  offering,  each  representing  one-tenth  of a share of  7.75%  Series C
cumulative  redeemable  preferred stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. The
Series C  preferred  stock has a  liquidation  preference  of $250.00  per share
($25.00 per depositary  share). The net proceeds were used to partially fund the
purchase of the four malls discussed below and for general corporate purposes.

     On September 15, 2003, the Company  repurchased 460,083 common units in the
Operating Partnership from a former executive of the Company who retired in 1997
for $21.0 million.

                                       3
<PAGE>

     The Company acquired Cross Creek Mall,  River Ridge Mall,  Valley View Mall
and Southpark Mall for a total purchase price of $340 million,  which  consisted
of cash of $170 million and the  assumption of $170 million of fixed-rate  debt.
These malls were acquired from a common owner and closed as follows: Cross Creek
Mall,  located in  Fayetteville,  NC, on September  10, 2003;  River Ridge Mall,
located in Lynchburg,  VA, and Valley View Mall,  in Roanoke,  VA, on October 1,
2003; and Southpark Mall, located in Colonial Heights, VA, on December 15, 2003.

     On September 24, 2003,  the Company  formed  Galileo  America LLC ("Galileo
America"),  a joint  venture with Galileo  America REIT,  the U.S.  affiliate of
Australia-based Galileo America Shopping Trust, to invest in power and community
centers  throughout  the United  States.  The Company has sold, or will sell, in
three phases,  its interests in 51 power and community centers for a total price
of $516.0 million plus a 10% interest in Galileo America.

     On  October  23,  2003,  the  parties  completed  the  first  phase  of the
transaction  when the Company  sold its  interests  in 41  community  centers to
Galileo America for $393.9  million,  which consisted of $250.7 million in cash,
the retirement of $24.9 million of debt on one of the community  centers, a note
receivable of $4.8  million,  Galileo  America's  assumption of $93.0 million in
debt and $20.5  million  representing  the  Company's  10%  interest  in Galileo
America.  The Company used the net proceeds to deposit cash in escrow to be used
in like-kind exchanges and to reduce outstanding  borrowings under the Company's
credit facilities. The note receivable was paid subsequent to December 31, 2003.

     The second phase of the transaction closed in January 2004 when the Company
sold its  interests  in six  community  centers  to  Galileo  America  for $92.4
million,  which  consisted of $62.7  million in cash,  the  retirement  of $25.9
million of debt on one of the community centers,  the joint venture's assumption
of $2.8 million of debt and closing  costs of $1.0  million.  The third phase is
scheduled to close in January 2005 and will include five community centers.  The
total purchase price for these community centers will be $86.8 million.

     Pursuant  to a  long-term  agreement,  the  Company  will be the  exclusive
manager for all of the joint venture's properties in the United States, and will
be entitled to management,  leasing, acquisition,  disposition, asset management
and financing fees.

     On  November  28,  2003,  the  Company  redeemed  the  remaining  2,675,000
outstanding shares of its 9.0% Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock at
its  liquidation  preference  of  $25.00  per  share  plus  accrued  and  unpaid
dividends.

     On December 30, 2003, the Company acquired 100% of the interests of Harford
Mall Business  Trust,  a Maryland  business  trust that owns Harford Mall in Bel
Air, MD, and its associated center, Harford Annex, for $71.0 million in cash.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS

     The Company is a  self-managed,  self-administered,  fully  integrated real
estate   investment   trust  ("REIT")  that  is  engaged  in  the   development,
acquisition, and operation of regional shopping malls and community centers. The
Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal  income tax  purposes.  As
one of the five  largest  mall  REITs in the United  States,  the  Company  owns
interests in properties  primarily in middle market communities in the Southeast
and Midwest, as well as in select markets in other regions of the United States.

     The  Company  conducts  substantially  all  of  its  business  through  the
Operating  Partnership.  The  Company  is the 100% owner of two  qualified  REIT
subsidiaries,  CBL  Holdings I, Inc.  and CBL  Holdings II, Inc. CBL Holdings I,
Inc. is the sole general partner of the Operating  Partnership.  At December 31,


                                       4
<PAGE>

2003,  CBL Holdings I, Inc.  owned a 1.7% general  partnership  interest and CBL
Holdings II, Inc.  owned a 52.9% limited  partnership  interest in the Operating
Partnership, for a combined interest held by the Company of 54.6%.


As of December 31, 2003, the Company owned:

     |X|  interests in a portfolio of operating properties including 60 enclosed
          regional malls (the "Malls"),  23 associated  centers (the "Associated
          Centers"),  59 community  centers (the  "Community  Centers")  and the
          Company's corporate office building (the "Office Building");

     |X|  interests  in two  regional  malls,  one  associated  center and three
          community   centers  that  are  currently  under   construction   (the
          "Construction  Properties"),  as well as options  to  acquire  certain
          shopping center development sites; and

     |X|  mortgages (the "Mortgages") on 12 properties that are secured by first
          mortgages or wrap-around  mortgages on the underlying  real estate and
          related improvements.

     The Malls, Associated Centers, Community Centers,  Construction Properties,
Mortgages and Office Building are  collectively  referred to as the "Properties"
and individually as a "Property."

     The Operating  Partnership  conducts the Company's property  management and
development   activities  through  CBL  &  Associates   Management,   Inc.  (the
"Management  Company").  The Operating  Partnership  holds 100% of the preferred
stock  and  owns  6% of the  common  stock  of  the  Management  Company.  CBL's
Predecessor  holds the remaining 94% of the Management  Company's  common stock.
Through its ownership of the preferred stock, the Operating Partnership receives
substantially all of the cash flow and enjoys  substantially all of the economic
benefits of the Management Company's operations.

     The Management  Company manages all of the Properties except for Governor's
Square and  Governor's  Plaza in  Clarksville,  TN and  Kentucky  Oaks Mall,  in
Paducah, KY. A property manager affiliated with the third party managing general
partner  performs the property  management  services  for these  Properties  and
receives  a fee  for its  services.  The  managing  partner  of  each  of  these
Properties controls the cash flow distributions, although the Company's approval
is required for certain major decisions.

         The Properties derive most of their income from rents received through
operating leases with retail tenants. These operating leases require tenants to
pay minimum rent, which is often subject to scheduled increases throughout the
term of the lease. Certain tenants are required to pay percentage rent if their
sales volumes exceed thresholds specified in their lease agreements.
Additionally, tenant leases generally provide that the Company will be
reimbursed for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and other
operating expenses incurred in the operation of the Properties.

         The following terms used in this annual report on Form 10-K will have
the meanings described below:

     |X|  GLA - refers to gross  leasable  area of retail  space in square feet,
          including anchors and mall tenants

     |X|  Anchor - refers to a department store or other large retail store

     |X|  Freestanding - property locations that are not attached to the primary
          complex of buildings that comprise the mall shopping center

     |X|  Outparcel - land used for  freestanding  developments,  such as retail
          stores, banks and restaurants, on the periphery of the Properties

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of
the  environment  may  require a current or  previous  owner or operator of real
property to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic  substances or petroleum
product  releases at the property,  without the current owner or operator having
knowledge of the presence of the  contaminants.  If  unidentified  environmental
problems arise at one of the Properties, substantial payments may be required to
a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation
and clean-up costs.  Even if more than one person may have been  responsible for
the  contamination,  the Company may be held responsible for all of the clean-up
costs incurred.  The liability under  environmental  laws could adversely affect
the Company's cash flow and ability to service its debt.

     All  of  the  Properties   have  been  subject  to  Phase  I  environmental
assessments,  which are  intended  to  discover  information  regarding,  and to
evaluate the  environmental  condition of, the surveyed property and surrounding
properties.  The Phase I  assessments  included a  historical  review,  a public
records review, a preliminary physical investigation of the site and surrounding
properties  regarding  historic uses for the preparation and issuance of written
reports  by  independent  environmental  consultants.  Some  of  the  Properties
contain, or contained,  underground storage tanks for storing petroleum products
or wastes typically  associated with automobile service or other operations,  as
well as  dry-cleaning  establishments  utilizing  solvents.  If  necessary,  the
Company will sample building materials or conduct subsurface investigations.  At
certain  Properties,  the Company has developed and  implemented  operations and
maintenance  programs with operating  procedures  regarding  asbestos-containing
materials.  Historically,  costs  associated  with these  programs have not been
material.

     The Phase I  assessments  have not revealed any  environmental  liabilities
that the Company believes will have a material effect on its business, assets or
results of  operations,  nor is the Company aware of any such  liability.  It is
possible that the  assessments  do not reveal all  environmental  liabilities or
that  there  are  material  liabilities  of which the  Company  is  unaware.  No
assurances can be given that (i) future laws, ordinances or regulations will not
impose any material  environmental  liability or (ii) the current  environmental
condition of the  Properties  will not be adversely  affected by the tenants and
occupants of the  Properties,  or by the  condition of other  properties  in the
vicinity of the  Properties  or by third parties  unrelated to the Company.  The
Company has obtained environmental insurance on all the Properties acquired from
Jacobs and selected others.

GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION

     The Company owns interests in 31 Malls, 16 Associated Centers, 24 Community
Centers  and one Office  Building  that are located in the  southeastern  United
States. These Properties accounted for 57.5% of the Company's total revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2003. Therefore, the Company's results of operations
and funds available for distribution to shareholders are significantly  impacted
by economic conditions in the southeastern United States.


     The Company  owns 15 Malls,  2 Associated  Centers and 5 Community  Centers
that are located in the Midwestern United States. These Properties accounted for
25.8% of the  Company's  revenues  for the year ended  December  31,  2003.  The
Company will continue to look for opportunities to geographically  diversify its
portfolio in order to minimize dependency on any geographical  region;  however,
the expansion of the portfolio  through both  acquisitions  and developments are
contingent on many factors including consumer demands,  competition and economic
conditions.

SIGNIFICANT PROPERTIES

     Revenues  at  Hanes  Mall,  Burnsville  Center,  Coolsprings  Galleria  and
Meridian Mall accounted for 3.81%, 2.75%, 2.72% and 2.66%, respectively,  of the
Company's  total  revenues for the year ended  December 31, 2003.  The Company's
financial  position and results of operations  will be somewhat  affected by the
results experienced at these Properties.

new entrances and floor coverings,  updating interior decor, resurfacing parking
lots and improving the lighting of interiors and parking lots.  Renovations  can
result in attracting new retailers,  increased rental rates and occupancy levels
and in maintaining the Property's market dominance.  As shown below, the Company
renovated six Properties  during 2003 and will renovate three Properties  during
2004.

 Development of New Retail Properties

     In general,  the Company seeks  development  opportunities in middle-market
trade areas that it believes are  under-served  by existing  retail  operations.

These middle-markets must also have sufficient demographic trends to provide the
opportunity to effectively maintain a competitive position.  The following shows
the new developments opened during 2003 and those currently under construction:

     The Company's  total  investment in the Properties that were opened in 2003
was $84.3  million.  Cobblestone  Village  and  Waterford  Commons  were sold to
Galileo America in October 2003 and January 2004, respectively. The developments
that are  currently  under  construction  will  represent an  investment  by the
Company of approximately $137.3 million.

Acquisitions

     The Company  believes there is opportunity for growth through  acquisitions
of regional  malls and other  associated  properties.  The  Company  selectively
acquires regional mall properties where it believes it can increase the value of
the property  through its  development,  leasing and management  expertise.  The
Company acquired the following Properties during 2003:

</TABLE>

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S GROWTH STRATEGY

     As with any strategy  there are risks  involved with the Company's plan for
growth.  Risks associated with developments and expansions can include,  but are
not limited to: development opportunities pursued may be abandoned; construction
costs may exceed estimates; construction loans with full recourse to the Company
may not be refinanced;  proforma objectives, such as occupancy and rental rates,
may not be achieved;  and the required  approval by an anchor  tenant,  mortgage
lender or property partner for certain expansion/development  activities may not
be obtained. An unsuccessful  development project could result in a loss greater
than the Company's investment.

INSURANCE

     The  Operating  Partnership  carries a  comprehensive  blanket  policy  for
liability,  fire and rental loss insurance covering all of the Properties,  with


                                       9
<PAGE>

specifications  and insured limits customarily  carried for similar  properties.
The Company  believes the Properties are adequately  insured in accordance  with
industry standards.

COMPETITION

     The  Properties  compete  with  various  shopping  alternatives  attracting
retailers to competing locations. Competition for both the consumer and retailer
includes open-air life-style centers, power center developments, outlet shopping
centers,  discount  retailers,  internet venues,  television  shopping networks,
direct mail and other  retail  shopping  developments.  The extent of the retail
competition  varies from market to market.  The Company  works  aggressively  to
attract customers through marketing promotions and campaigns.

QUALIFICATION AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST ("REIT")

     The Company  intends to continue to be taxed as a REIT under  Sections  856
through 860 of the Internal  Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code").  The Company
generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent it distributes
at least 90% of its REIT ordinary taxable income to its shareholders. Failing to
qualify as a REIT in any taxable year would result in the Company  being subject
to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

     See Note 12 to the consolidated  financial statements for information about
the Company's reportable segments.

EMPLOYEES

     The Company does not have any employees other than its statutory  officers.
The  Management  Company  currently  employees  678  full-time and 407 part-time
employees.   None  of  the  Company's  or  Management  Company's  employees  are
represented by a union.

CORPORATE OFFICES

MALLS

     The Company  owns a  controlling  interest in 56 Malls and  non-controlling
interests in four Malls. The Company also owns non-controlling  interests in two
Malls that are currently under construction.  The Malls are primarily located in
middle markets and have strong competitive  positions because they are the only,
or dominant, regional mall in their respective trade areas.

     The Malls are  generally  anchored by two or more  department  stores and a
wide  variety of mall  stores.  Anchor  tenants  own or lease  their  stores and
non-anchor stores (20,000 square feet or less) lease their locations. Additional
freestanding  stores and  restaurants  that either own or lease their stores are
typically located along the perimeter of the Malls' parking areas.

     The  Company  classifies  its Malls into two  categories  - Malls that have
completed  their  initial  lease-up  ("Stabilized  Malls") and Malls that are in
their initial lease-up phase  ("Non-Stabilized  Malls"). The Non-Stabilized Mall
category  currently  includes  The Lakes Mall in  Muskegon,  MI, which opened in
August 2001, and Parkway Place in Huntsville, AL, which opened in October 2002.

     The land underlying each Mall is owned in fee simple  interest,  except for
Walnut  Square,  WestGate Mall,  St. Clair Square,  Bonita Lakes Mall,  Meridian
Mall,  Stroud  Mall,  Wausau  Center and Eastgate  Mall.  Each of these Malls is
subject to long-term ground leases for all or a portion of the land.


     The following table sets forth certain information for each of the Malls as
of December 31, 2003.

Anchors

     Anchors are an important  factor in a Mall's  successful  performance.  The
public's  identification  with a mall property  typically  focuses on the anchor
tenants. Mall anchors are generally a department store whose merchandise appeals
to a broad range of shoppers and plays a significant role in generating customer
traffic and creating a desirable location for the mall store tenants.

     Anchors  may own  their  stores  and the  land  underneath,  as well as the
adjacent parking areas, or may enter into long-term leases with respect to their
stores.  Approximately  28% of the  anchor  square  footage  is  leased  and the
remaining  72% is owned by the  anchor.  Rental  rates for  anchor  tenants  are
significantly  lower  than the rents  charged  to mall  store  tenants.  Anchors
account  for 7.7% of the total  revenues  from the  Company's  Properties.  Each
anchor that owns its store has entered into an operating and reciprocal easement
agreement  with  the  Company  covering  items  such  as  operating   covenants,
reciprocal  easements,  property  operations,  initial  construction  and future
expansion.

COMMUNITY CENTERS

     The  Company  owns a  controlling  interest  in 17  Community  Centers  and
non-controlling  interests in two Community  Centers.  The Company also owns two
Community Centers that are currently under construction.

     Community  Centers  typically have less development risk because of shorter
development  periods and lower costs. While Community Centers generally maintain
higher  occupancy  levels and are more stable,  they  typically have slower rent
growth because the anchor  stores' rents are typically  fixed and are for longer
terms.

     Community Centers are designed to attract local and regional area customers
and are typically  anchored by a combination of  supermarkets,  or  value-priced
stores that attract  shoppers to each center's  small shops.  The tenants at the
Company's  Community Centers  typically offer  necessities,  value-oriented  and
convenience merchandise.

     As discussed under Recent  Developments,  the Company sold its interests in
41  community  centers to Galileo  America  in October  2003 and  acquired a 10%
interest in Galileo America.

Item 7:  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
         of Operations

     The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations  should  be read  in  conjunction  with  the  consolidated  financial
statements  and  accompanying  notes that are  included in this  annual  report.
Capitalized  terms used, but not defined,  in this  Management's  Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have the same meanings
as  defined  in the  notes to the  consolidated  financial  statements.  In this
discussion,  the  terms  "we",  "us",  "our"  and the  "Company"  refer to CBL &
Associates Properties, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

     Certain  statements made in this section or elsewhere in this report may be
deemed "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities
laws.  Although we believe the  expectations  reflected  in any  forward-looking
statements  are based on reasonable  assumptions,  we can give no assurance that
these expectations will be attained,  and it is possible that actual results may
differ materially from those indicated by these  forward-looking  statements due
to a variety of risks and uncertainties.  Such risks and uncertainties  include,
without limitation, general industry, economic and business conditions, interest
rate fluctuations,  costs of capital and capital  requirements,  availability of
real estate  properties,  inability  to  consummate  acquisition  opportunities,
competition  from other companies and retail  formats,  changes in retail rental
rates in the Company's markets,  shifts in customer demands, tenant bankruptcies
or store  closings,  changes  in  vacancy  rates at our  properties,  changes in
operating  expenses,  changes in applicable  laws,  rules and  regulations,  the
ability to obtain  suitable  equity  and/or  debt  financing  and the  continued
availability  of financing in the amounts and on the terms  necessary to support
our  future  business.  We  disclaim  any  obligation  to update  or revise  any
forward-looking  statements to reflect  actual results or changes in the factors
affecting the forward-looking information.

OVERVIEW

     We are a  self-managed,  self-administered,  fully  integrated  real estate
investment  trust  ("REIT")  that  is  engaged  in the  ownership,  development,
acquisition,  leasing,  management and operation of regional  shopping malls and
community  centers.  Our shopping center properties are located primarily in the
Southeast  and  Midwest,  as well as in select  markets in other  regions of the
United States.

     As of December  31,  2003,  we owned  controlling  interests in 56 regional
malls,  21 associated  centers (each adjacent to a regional  shopping  mall), 17
community  centers,  and our  corporate  office  building.  We  consolidate  the
financial  statements of all entities in which we have a  controlling  financial
interest.  As of December 31, 2003, we owned  non-controlling  interests in four
regional malls, two associated centers and 42 community  centers.  Because major
decisions such as the acquisition,  sale or refinancing of principal partnership
or joint venture  assets must be approved by one or more of the other  partners,
we do not  control  these  partnerships  and joint  ventures  and,  accordingly,
account for these  investments  using the equity method.  We had two malls, both
owned in joint  ventures,  three mall  expansions,  one associated  center,  two
community  centers and one community center  expansion under  construction as of
December 31, 2003.

     The majority of our  revenues  are derived from leases with retail  tenants
and generally  include base minimum  rents,  percentage  rents based on tenants'
sales  volumes  and  reimbursements  from  tenants for  expenditures,  including
property operating  expenses,  real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs, as
well as certain capital  expenditures.  We also generate  revenues from sales of
outparcel  land at the properties and from sales of operating real estate assets
when it is  determined  that we can  realize  the  maximum  value of the assets.
Proceeds from such sales are generally  used to reduce  borrowings on the credit
facilities.

     Our  regional  mall  portfolio  performed  well during 2003 as evidenced by
consistently  high occupancy  levels,  increased rents on expiring  leases,  and
growth in both specialty  leasing income and  same-store  mall store sales.  The


                                       28
<PAGE>

properties  we  acquired   over  the  past  two  years  also  made   significant
contributions to our growth in 2003 as we continued to leverage our expertise to
improve the tenant mix in these  properties  and to capitalize on  opportunities
for specialty leasing income.

     We  expanded  our  portfolio  with the  acquisition  of six  malls  and two
associated  centers  during  2003,  representing  a total  investment  of $494.6
million.  The  acquisition  market  is  competitive  and we  continue  to pursue
potential  acquisition  opportunities  where we believe that we can leverage our
expertise to enhance the value of the property.

     During 2003, we obtained a new secured credit  facility and  capitalized on
the favorable  interest rate environment by obtaining  non-recourse,  fixed-rate
mortgage loans on several of our properties.  We also made a strategic  decision
to  contribute  ownership  interests in 51 of our  community  centers to Galileo
America  LLC  ("Galileo   America'),   a  joint  venture  we  have  formed  with
Australia-based  Galileo America Shopping Trust.  Galileo America Shopping Trust
has a  controlling  90%  interest  in  the  joint  venture  and  we  have  a 10%
noncontrolling  interest.  While this  transaction  will result in a  short-term
dilution to earnings, we believe it allows us to develop and acquire real estate
assets that will be more productive in the long-term and provides us access to a
new capital market.

     On October 23, 2003, we completed the first phase of the  transaction  when
we sold interests in 41 community centers to Galileo America. In accordance with
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards ("SFAS") No. 144,  "Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets",  the results of operations of
these  properties  have not been  reflected as  discontinued  operations  in the
consolidated   financial   statements  since  we  have  significant   continuing
involvement  with the properties  through our 10% ownership  interest in Galileo
America and the long-term agreement under which we will be the exclusive manager
of the properties.

     Bankruptcy  filings and store  closings by retail tenants are normal in the
course of our  business.  Our  leasing  personnel  continually  work to re-lease
spaces  that  become  vacant  due to  bankruptcies,  store  closings  and  lease
expirations.   During  2003,   bankruptcies   resulted  in  63  store  closings,
representing  $5.1 million in annual gross rentals.  Subsequent to year-end,  KB
Toys, Gadzooks, One Price Clothing, and Footstar filed for bankruptcy. The total
annual gross rentals related to the stores these retailers have notified us will
be closing is $4.2 million.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 TO THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2002

     The following significant transactions impacted the consolidated results of
operations  for the year ended  December  31,  2003,  compared to the year ended
December 31, 2002:

     |X|  The  acquisition  of six  malls  and two  associated  centers  and the
          opening of one new  associated  center and two new  community  centers
          during 2003. Additionally, there was a full year of operations in 2003
          for three malls and one  associated  center that were acquired  during
          2002 and one associated center that was opened in 2002. The properties
          opened or acquired during 2003 and 2002 are  collectively  referred to
          as the "New Properties" and are as follows:

     |X|  The  consolidation  of a full year of operations  for East Towne Mall,
          West Towne  Mall and West  Towne  Crossing  (the  "Newly  Consolidated
          Properties")  in which we acquired the  remaining  ownership  interest
          during  December  2002.  We had  previously  owned  a  non-controlling
          interest  in these  properties  and had  accounted  for them using the
          equity method of accounting.

     |X|  The sale of interests in 41  community  centers to Galileo  America in
          October 2003 ("the Galileo Transaction").

Revenues

     The $80.6  million  increase  in revenues  was  primarily  attributable  to
increases of $44.7 million from the New Properties, $23.6 million from the Newly
Consolidated Properties and $20.6 million from properties that were in operation
for all of 2003 and 2002, offset by a reduction of $6.7 million from the Galileo
Transaction.

     The increase in revenues at  properties  that were in operation  for all of
2003 and 2002 was  primarily  driven by our ability to maintain  high  occupancy
levels  while  achieving  increases  in rents  from  both new  leases  and lease
renewals on comparable spaces. Additionally, our cost recovery ratio improved to
99.2% in 2003 compared to 91.4% in 2002 due primarily to the partial recovery of
certain capital expenditures  incurred in connection with the significant number
of mall  renovations  completed  during  the past  three  years.

     Management,  leasing and development fees decreased $1.6 million because of
a reduction in fees related to the Newly Consolidated Properties.

Operating Expenses

     Property  operating  expenses  (including real estate taxes and maintenance
and repairs)  increased $20.0 million due to increases of $15.5 million from the
New Properties and $7.4 million from the Newly Consolidated  Properties,  offset
by a reduction of $2.9 million from the Galileo Transaction.

                                       30
<PAGE>

     The  $19.5  million  increase  in  depreciation  and  amortization  expense
resulted from  increases of $9.2 million from the New  Properties,  $4.2 million
from the Newly  Consolidated  Properties  and $7.1 million  from the  comparable
centers,  which is primarily  attributable  to the 16 property  renovations  and
expansions that were completed during 2003 and 2002. These increases were offset
by a reduction of $1.0 million from the Galileo Transaction.

     General and administrative expenses increased $7.1 million because we had a
lower  level of  development  activity  in 2003 than in 2002.  As a  result,  we
capitalized  less in  salaries  of  leasing  and  development  personnel,  which
resulted in higher compensation expense. There were also additional salaries and
benefits for the personnel  added to manage the properties  acquired during 2003
and 2002 combined with normal wage increases for existing personnel.

Other Income and Expenses

     Interest  expense  increased  $10.3  million  due to the  debt  on the  New
Properties and the Newly  Consolidated  Properties.  We also  refinanced  $196.0
million  of  short-term,   variable-rate  debt  with  fixed-rate,   non-recourse
long-term debt with a higher  interest rate. The increase was offset somewhat by
a reduction  in debt  related to the Galileo  Transaction  and normal  principal
amortization. While converting to fixed-rate debt is dilutive in the short-term,
it is consistent with our strategy of minimizing  exposure to variable-rate debt
when we can obtain  fixed-rate  debt on terms that are deemed  favorable for the
long-term.

     The net gain on sales of $77.8 million in 2003 was  primarily  attributable
to the $71.9 million gain recognized on the Galileo  Transaction.  The remaining
$5.9 million of gain was related to gains on sales of 20  outparcels  at various
properties and sales of two options on potential development sites.

     Equity in  earnings  decreased  by $3.3  million in 2003 as a result of the
Newly  Consolidated  Properties  no longer being  accounted for using the equity
method.

     Six community  centers were sold during 2003 for a net gain on discontinued
operations  of $4.0  million.  Operating  income  from  discontinued  operations
decreased in 2003 because the properties were owned for a shorter period of time
in 2003 than in 2002,  and because 2002  includes the  operations  of properties
that were sold during 2002.

COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 TO THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2001

     The following significant transactions impacted the consolidated results of
operations  for the year ended  December  31,  2002,  compared to the year ended
December 31, 2001:

     |X|  The acquisition of ownership  interests in 21 malls and two associated
          centers  from The Richard E. Jacobs  Group  ("Jacobs")  on January 31,
          2001;  therefore,  the  results  of  operations  for 2002  include  an
          additional  month of  operations  for these  properties as compared to
          2001.  In March  2002,  the  second  and  final  stage  of the  Jacobs
          acquisition was completed with the acquisition of additional interests
          in four malls and one associated center.

     |X|  The acquisition or opening of three additional  properties during 2001

     |X|  Six  community  centers  were sold  during  2001 and their  results of
          operations are included in income from operations in 2001 through each
          property's  respective disposal date. The results of operations of the
          five  community  centers and the office  building sold during 2002 are
          included in  discontinued  operations  for all periods  presented as a
          result of the adoption of SFAS No. 144.

     |X|  During the first quarter of 2002, we began to include  Columbia  Place
          in  Columbia,  SC,  in the  consolidated  financial  statements  after
          acquiring an additional  31% interest in the property,  which resulted
          in our owning a 79% controlling  interest. In August 2002, we acquired
          the remaining 21% interest in Columbia Place. Our interest in Columbia
          Place  was  previously  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method  of
          accounting.

     |X|  In February  2002,  we  contributed  90% of our interests in Pemberton
          Plaza, an associated center in Vicksburg, MS, and Massard Crossing and
          Willowbrook  Plaza,  community  centers located in Ft. Smith,  AR, and
          Houston,  TX,  respectively,  to a joint venture that is accounted for
          using  the  equity  method  of  accounting.   Prior  to  the  date  of
          contribution,  the  results of  operations  of these  properties  were
          included in our consolidated statements of operations.

Revenues

     The $49.7 million increase in revenues was primarily attributable to:

     |X|  $21.9 million from an  additional  month of operations in 2002 related
          to the Jacobs  properties  combined with  improvements  in leasing and
          occupancy at the Jacobs properties,

     |X|  $30.1 million from the additional nine  properties  opened or acquired
          during 2002 and 2001,

     |X|  $5.5  million  from both the  continued  improvement  in  leasing  and
          occupancy  at   comparable   properties   and  an  increase  in  lease
          termination  fees of $1.4 million to $5.5 million in 2002  compared to
          $4.1 million in 2001,

     |X|  an increase of $2.0  million in  management,  leasing and  development
          fees as a result of  management  and leasing fees from  unconsolidated
          affiliates  that were acquired in the Jacobs  transaction  and from an
          unconsolidated affiliate that began operations during 2002

     |X|  a reduction of $5.0 million related to the properties sold during 2001
          and

     |X|  a reduction of $6.4 million related to the three  properties that were
          contributed to a joint venture early in 2002.

Operating Expenses

      Property operating expenses (including real estate taxes and maintenance
and repairs) increased by $10.7 million due to:

                                       32
<PAGE>


          |X|  an increase of $4.6 million  related to the  additional  month in
               2002 for the Jacobs properties,

          |X|  an increase of $11.4 million related to the other nine properties
               opened or acquired during 2002 and 2001 and

          |X|  a reduction of $2.3 million  related to both the properties  sold
               during  2001  and the  three  properties  contributed  to a joint
               venture in 2002.

     Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $10.5 million due to:


          |X|  an increase of $2.0 million  related to the additional  month for
               the Jacobs properties,

          |X|  an additional  $3.5 million  related to the other nine properties
               opened or acquired during 2002 and 2001,

          |X|  additional  depreciation  of $6.9 million  related to the capital
               expenditures  made  during 2002 and 2001 in  connection  with the
               ongoing  renovations  at other capital  expenditures  at existing
               properties

          |X|  a reduction of $1.9 million  related to both the properties  sold
               during  2001  and the  three  properties  contributed  to a joint
               venture.

     General and administrative expenses increased $4.5 million primarily due to
additional  salaries  and  benefits  for  the  personnel  added  to  manage  the
properties  acquired during 2002 and 2001.  Increased  professional fees and the
costs  to  move  to our  new  corporate  headquarters  also  contributed  to the
increase.

Other Income and Expenses

     Interest expense decreased $13.5 million due to reductions of debt with net
proceeds of $114.7  million  from the March 2002 common  stock  offering and net
proceeds of $96.4 million from the June 2002 preferred stock offering.

      The loss on extinguishment of debt decreased from $13.6 million in 2001 to
$3.9 million in 2002 because we retired less debt subject to prepayment
penalties in 2002 as compared to 2001.

     The net gain on sales of real  estate  assets of $2.8  million  in 2002 was
related to total gains of $3.3 million on seven outparcel sales and total losses
of $0.5 million on three outparcel sales. The net gain on sales of $10.6 million
in 2001 includes a net gain on sales of operating properties of $8.4 million and
a net gain of $1.8 million from sales of nine outparcels.

     Equity in  earnings  of  unconsolidated  affiliates  increased  because  we
acquired  additional  partnership  interests in East Towne Mall, West Towne Mall
and West Towne Crossing in Madison,  WI, and Kentucky Oaks Mall in Paducah,  KY,
in March 2002.  The increase was offset by the effect of accounting for Columbia
Place  as a  consolidated  property  in 2002 as  compared  to an  unconsolidated
affiliate in 2001.

     Five community  centers and an office  building were sold during 2002 for a
net gain on discontinued  operations of $0.4 million.  The  fluctuation  between
years in operating income from discontinued  operations  results from the timing
of the dispositions during each year.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW

     The shopping  center  business is, to some extent,  seasonal in nature with
tenants  achieving the highest levels of sales during the fourth quarter because
of the holiday season.  Additionally,  the malls earn most of their  "temporary"
rents  (rents  from  short-term  tenants),  during  the  holiday  period.  Thus,
occupancy levels and revenue  production are generally the highest in the fourth
quarter of each year. Results of operations  realized in any one quarter may not
be indicative  of the results  likely to be  experienced  over the course of the
fiscal year.

     We  classify  our  regional  malls  into two  categories  - malls that have
completed  their  initial  lease-up  ("Stabilized  Malls") and malls that are in


                                       33
<PAGE>

their initial  lease-up phase  ("Non-Stabilized  Malls").  Non-Stabilized  Malls
currently  include The Lakes Mall in Muskegon,  MI, which opened in August 2001;
and Parkway Place in Huntsville, AL, which opened in October 2002.

     We derive a significant  amount of our revenues  from the mall  properties.
The sources of our revenues by property type were as follows:

Sales and Occupancy Costs

     Mall store sales (for those  tenants who occupy  10,000 square feet or less
and  have  reported  sales)  in the  Stabilized  Malls  increased  by  1.1% on a
comparable  per square foot basis to $300.16  per square foot for 2003  compared
with  $296.95 per square foot for 2002.  The  increase in 2003  represented  the
first year-over-year  increase in three years, as sales were either flat or down
slightly in those years.

     Occupancy  costs as a  percentage  of sales for the  Stabilized  Malls were
12.2% and 12.0% for 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Occupancy

     The occupancy of the portfolio was as follows:

</TABLE>

     The occupancy of the Associated Centers declined during 2003 because of the
vacancy of a 36,000  square foot Just For Feet Store at the Village at Rivergate
in  Nashville,  TN and a 46,000  square  foot  Appliance  Factory  Warehouse  at
Hamilton  Corner in  Chattanooga,  TN. The continued  vacancy of a 68,000 square
foot  former  Ames store at  Westmoreland  Crossing,  which was vacant  when the
center  was  acquired  in  December  2002,  also had a  negative  impact  on the
occupancy of the Associated Centers.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     There was $20.3 million of  unrestricted  cash and cash  equivalents  as of
December 31, 2003,  an increase of $7.0  million  from  December 31, 2002.  Cash
flows from  operations are used to fund  short-term  liquidity and capital needs
such as tenant  construction  allowances,  capital  expenditures and payments of
dividends  and   distributions.   For   longer-term   liquidity  needs  such  as
acquisitions, new developments, renovations and expansions, we typically rely on
property specific mortgages (which are generally non-recourse), construction and
term loans,  revolving lines of credit,  common stock,  preferred  stock,  joint
venture investments and a minority interest in the Operating Partnership.

Cash Flows

     Cash  provided by  operating  activities  increased  $0.4 million to $274.3
million.  Although  the  addition  of  New  Properties  and  Newly  Consolidated
Properties,  combined with improved results at existing centers,  contributed to
an increase  in  operating  cash flows,  the  increase  was offset by  decreases
related to the timing of reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

     Cash  used in  investing  activities  increased  $58.8  million  to  $333.4
million.  Cash used to acquire real estate assets increased by $106.8 million to
$273.3 million due to the  acquisition  of six malls and two associated  centers
during 2003 compared to three malls and one associated  center acquired in 2002.
Cash paid for capital  expenditures  increased  $45.5 million to $227.4  million
primarily  due  to  the  Company's  investments  in  development  projects,  the
renovations  of six malls in 2003 and  expenditures  for tenant  allowances  and
deferred  maintenance.  The increases in cash outflows for investing  activities
were offset by an increase of $121.0 million in net proceeds received from sales
of real estate assets to $205.8  million as a result of the Galileo  Transaction
and the sales of six  community  centers and 20  outparcels  in 2003 compared to
five  community  centers,  an office  building and 10  outparcels  sold in 2002.


                                       35
<PAGE>

Additionally,  we paid $21.0  million to purchase the minority  interest held by
one of our former executive officers who retired in 1997.

     Cash  provided by financing  activities  increased  $62.1  million to $66.0
million in 2003 compared to $3.9 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due
to a  significant  reduction in the amount of debt  retired in 2003  compared to
2002. This was partially offset by the redemption of our 9.0% Series A preferred
stock and an increase in dividends and distributions paid.

Debt

     The following  tables  summarize debt based on our pro rata ownership share
(including  our pro  rata  share  of  unconsolidated  affiliates  and  excluding
minority  investors' share of consolidated  properties)  because we believe this
provides  investors a clearer  understanding  of our total debt  obligations and
liquidity (in thousands):

     On February 28 2003,  we entered  into a new secured  credit  facility  for
$255.0  million that replaced both a secured  credit  facility of $130.0 million
and an unsecured  credit  facility of $105.3  million.  By entering into the new
credit  facility,  we were able to lower the  interest  rate to LIBOR plus 1.00%
from LIBOR plus 1.5% on the previous unsecured line of credit. We currently have
four secured credit  facilities with total  availability  of $365.0 million,  of
which $304.0 million was  outstanding  as of December 31, 2003.  There were also
letters of credit totaling $17.3 million  outstanding under these secured credit
facilities as of December 31, 2003. The secured credit  facilities bear interest
at LIBOR plus 1.00%.

     We have a  short-term,  unsecured  credit  facility of $130.0  million that
matures May 31, 2004 and bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.30%.  We have the option
to extend the maturity to September 30, 2004.  We obtained this credit  facility
to provide  resources for the acquisitions that were completed during the fourth
quarter of 2003.  There was $72.0  million  outstanding  under this  facility at
December 31, 2003.

                                       36
<PAGE>

     We also have  secured  lines of credit  with  total  availability  of $21.6
million  that can only be used to issue  letters  of  credit.  There  was  $16.6
million outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2003.

     On September 12, 2003, we closed four long-term,  non-recourse,  fixed-rate
mortgage loans totaling $196.0 million that are secured by three of our regional
malls and one associated  center.  The loans bear interest at rates ranging from
4.52% to 5.45% and have terms of five to ten years.

     We assumed  $209.8  million  of debt in  connection  with the  acquisitions
completed  during 2003. The loan of $40.0 million  related to Sunrise Mall bears
interest at LIBOR plus 3.00%,  with a minimum rate of 4.90%,  and matures in May
2004. The loan on Sunrise Mall was assumed  subject to a  pre-existing  interest
rate cap agreement of 5.50% that also matures in May 2004.  The remaining  loans
that were assumed during 2003 bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 7.00% to
8.60% and  mature at  various  dates from  January  2007 to May 2012.  Since the
stated  interest  rates on the  fixed-rate  loans  were above  market  rates for
similar  debt  instruments  as of the  respective  dates  of  acquisition,  debt
premiums of $26.3 million were recorded to reflect the assumed debt at estimated
fair values.

     The  secured  and  unsecured  credit   facilities   contain,   among  other
restrictions,  certain financial  covenants including the maintenance of certain
coverage ratios,  minimum net worth  requirements,  and limitations on cash flow
distributions.   We  were  in  compliance  with  all  financial   covenants  and
restrictions  under our credit  facilities  at December 31, 2003.  Additionally,
certain property-specific mortgage notes payable require the maintenance of debt
service coverage ratios.  At December 31, 2003, the properties  subject to these
mortgage notes payable were in compliance with the applicable ratios.

     We expect to refinance  the  majority of mortgage  and other notes  payable
maturing over the next five years with replacement  loans. Based on our pro rata
share of total debt, there is $238.3 million of debt that is scheduled to mature
in 2004.  There are extension  options in place that will extend the maturity of
$94.3  million of this debt to 2005.  We repaid  $32.0  million  of these  loans
subsequent  to December  31, 2003,  and expect to either repay or refinance  the
remaining $112.0 million of maturing loans.

Equity

     On August  22,  2003,  we issued  4,600,000  depositary  shares in a public
offering,  each  representing  one-tenth of a share of 7.75% Series C cumulative
redeemable  preferred  stock with a par value of $0.01 per  share.  The Series C
preferred  stock has a  liquidation  preference of $250.00 per share ($25.00 per
depositary  share).  The net  proceeds of $111.2  million were used to partially
fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.

     We redeemed the remaining 2,675,000 outstanding shares of the 9.0% Series A
cumulative redeemable preferred stock at its face value of $25.00 per share plus
accrued and unpaid  dividends on November 28, 2003. We also recorded a charge of
$2.2  million  to  write-off  direct  issuance  costs  that were  recorded  as a
reduction of additional  paid-in  capital when the Series A preferred  stock was
issued.  The charge was  reflected  in preferred  dividends in the  consolidated
statement of operations.

     As a publicly  traded  company,  we have access to capital through both the
public  equity  and  debt  markets.  We have  an  effective  shelf  registration
statement  authorizing  us to publicly issue shares of preferred  stock,  common
stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock with an aggregate  public
offering  price up to $562.0  million,  of which  approximately  $447.0  million
remains after the Series C preferred stock offering.

     We anticipate that the combination of equity and debt sources will, for the
foreseeable future,  provide adequate liquidity to continue our capital programs
substantially  as in the past  and make  distributions  to our  shareholders  in
accordance with the requirements applicable to real estate investment trusts.

     one  community  center  in the  first  phase.  As  discussed  in Note 5, an
     additional  obligation  of $7,305 was recorded  subsequent  to December 31,
     2003 when six additional  community centers were sold to Galileo America in
     January  2004.  We have  executed  leases with  tenants for certain  spaces
     totaling $4,855 that will reduce the $7,305 to $2,450.

Capital Expenditures

     We expect to continue to have access to the capital resources  necessary to
expand and develop our business.  Future development and acquisition  activities
will be undertaken as suitable  opportunities  arise. We do not expect to pursue
these  activities  unless  adequate  sources of financing  are  available  and a
satisfactory  budget with  targeted  returns on investment  has been  internally
approved.

     An annual capital expenditures budget is prepared for each property that is
intended  to provide  for all  necessary  recurring  and  non-recurring  capital
expenditures.  We believe that  property  operating  cash flows,  which  include
reimbursements  from tenants for certain  expenses,  will provide the  necessary
funding for these expenditures.

     There  are  construction  loans  in  place  for the  costs  of the new mall
developments.  The costs of the remaining projects will be funded with operating
cash flows and the credit facilities.

     We have entered into a number of option  agreements for the  development of
future regional malls and community  centers.  Except for the projects discussed
under  Developments  and  Expansions  above,  we do not have any other  material
capital commitments.

Acquisitions

     We  acquired  six  malls  and two  associated  centers  during  2003 for an
aggregate  purchase price of $494.6  million,  including  transaction  costs. We
assumed  $209.8  million  of debt and paid  $273.1  million  in cash to fund the
purchase prices of these  acquisitions.  The cash portion of the purchase prices
was funded with borrowings under the credit facilities, proceeds from the Series
C preferred  stock  offering and proceeds  from the Galileo  Transaction.  These
acquisitions are expected to generate an initial  weighted-average,  unleveraged
return of 8.58%.

Dispositions

     During 2003, we generated aggregate net proceeds of $284.3 million from the
Galileo  Transaction,  the sales of six  community  centers  and the sales of 20
outparcels.  The net  proceeds  were used to either  fund  acquisitions,  reduce
borrowings  under the credit  facilities  or were placed in escrow to be used in
like-kind  exchanges.  In January 2004, we sold six additional community centers
to Galileo America. The net proceeds of $62.7 million were used to deposit funds
in escrow to be used in like-kind  exchanges and to reduce outstanding  balances
under our lines of credit.

Other Capital Expenditures

     Including our share of unconsolidated affiliates' capital expenditures,  we
spent $35.0  million in 2003 for tenant  allowances,  which  generate  increased
rents  from  tenants  over  the  terms  of their  leases.  Deferred  maintenance
expenditures  were  $21.0  million  for  2003  and  included  $3.1  million  for
resurfacing and improved lighting of parking lots, $5.1 million for roof repairs
and  replacements and $12.8 million for various other  expenditures.  Renovation
expenditures   were  $68.5  million  in  2003  and  included  $9.7  million  for
resurfacing  and  improved  lighting of parking  lots and $4.6  million for roof
repairs and replacements.

     Deferred  maintenance  expenditures  are billed to  tenants as common  area
maintenance  expense,  and  most  are  recovered  over a 5- to  15-year  period.
Renovation  expenditures  are primarily for remodeling and upgrades of malls, of
which approximately 30% is recovered from tenants over a 5- to 15-year period.

     We expect to  complete  three  renovation  projects  during 2004 at a total
estimated cost of $22.5 million, which will be funded from operating cash flows.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Unconsolidated Affiliates

     We have  ownership  interests  in ten  unconsolidated  affiliates  that are
described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The unconsolidated
affiliates  are  accounted  for using the equity  method of  accounting  and are
reflected in the consolidated  balance sheets as "Investments in  Unconsolidated
Affiliates." The following are circumstances  when we may consider entering into
a joint venture with a third party:

                                       40
<PAGE>

          |X|  Third parties may approach us with opportunities  where they have
               obtained land and performed some pre-development  activities, but
               they may not have sufficient  access to the capital  resources or
               the  development  and leasing  expertise  to bring the project to
               fruition.  We enter into such arrangements when we determine such
               a project is viable and we can achieve a satisfactory  return. We
               typically  earn  development  fees  from the  joint  venture  and
               provide  management and leasing  services to the property once it
               is placed in operation.

          |X|  We determine  that we may have the  opportunity  to capitalize on
               the value we have created in a property by selling an interest in
               a property to a third party.  This provides us with an additional
               source  of  capital  that  can be  used  to  develop  or  acquire
               additional  real  estate  assets  that we  believe  will  provide
               greater  potential  for growth.  When we retain an interest in an
               asset  rather  than  selling  a 100%  interest,  it is  typically
               because this allows us to continue to manage the property,  which
               provides us the opportunity to earn fees for management, leasing,
               development,  financing and acquisition  services provided to the
               joint venture.

 Guarantees

     We  have  guaranteed  100%  of the  debt  to be  incurred  to  develop  the
properties  that will be owned by two of our joint  ventures and 50% of the debt
of another joint venture.  We have issued these guarantees  primarily because it
allows  the joint  ventures  to obtain  funding  at a lower  cost than  could be
obtained otherwise. This results in a higher return for the joint venture on its
investment,  and in a higher return on our investment in the joint  venture.  We
may  receive  a  fee  from  the  joint   venture  for  providing  the  guaranty.
Additionally, when we are required to perform under a guaranty, the terms of the
guaranty  typically  provide that the joint venture  partners'  interests in the
joint venture is assigned to us, to the extent of our guaranty.

     The  Company's  guarantees  and  the  related  accounting  are  more  fully
described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Our  significant  accounting  policies  are  disclosed  in  Note  2 to  the
consolidated  financial statements.  The following discussion describes our most
critical  accounting  policies,  which are those that are both  important to the
presentation  of our  financial  condition  and results of  operations  and that
require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.

Revenue Recognition

     Minimum  rental   revenue  from   operating   leases  is  recognized  on  a
straight-line  basis  over the  initial  terms of the  related  leases.  Certain
tenants  are  required to pay  percentage  rent if their  sales  volumes  exceed
thresholds specified in their lease agreements. Percentage rent is recognized as
revenue when the thresholds are achieved and the amounts become determinable.

     We receive  reimbursements  from tenants for real estate taxes,  insurance,
common area maintenance, and other recoverable operating expenses as provided in
the lease  agreements.  Tenant  reimbursements  are recognized as revenue in the
period the  related  operating  expenses  are  incurred.  Tenant  reimbursements
related to certain capital  expenditures are billed to tenants over periods of 5
to 15 years and are recognized as revenue when billed.

     We receive management,  leasing and development fees from third parties and
unconsolidated  affiliates.  Management  fees are  charged  as a  percentage  of
revenues (as defined in the management  agreement) and are recognized as revenue
when earned. Development fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over
the development  period.  Leasing fees are charged for newly executed leases and
lease  renewals  and are  recognized  as revenue when  earned.  Development  and


                                       41
<PAGE>

leasing fees  received from  unconsolidated  affiliates  during the  development
period are  recognized  as revenue  to the extent of the  third-party  partners'
ownership interest. Fees to the extent of our ownership interest are recorded as
a reduction to our investment in the unconsolidated affiliate.

     Gains on sales of real estate assets are  recognized  when it is determined
that  the  sale  has  been  consummated,  the  buyer's  initial  and  continuing
investment  is  adequate,  our  receivable,  if any,  is not  subject  to future
subordination,  and the  buyer  has  assumed  the usual  risks  and  rewards  of
ownership of the asset. When we have an ownership interest in the buyer, gain is
recognized to the extent of the third party partner's ownership interest and the
portion of the gain attributable to our ownership interest is deferred.

Real Estate Assets

     We  capitalize  predevelopment  project  costs paid to third  parties.  All
previously  capitalized  predevelopment  costs are expensed when it is no longer
probable  that the project  will be  completed.  Once  development  of a project
commences,  all direct  costs  incurred  to  construct  the  project,  including
interest and real estate taxes, are capitalized.  Additionally,  certain general
and administrative  expenses are allocated to the projects and capitalized based
on the amount of time  applicable  personnel  work on the  development  project.
Ordinary  repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Major  replacements
and  improvements  are capitalized and depreciated  over their estimated  useful
lives.

     All acquired real estate assets are accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting  and  accordingly,  the results of operations  are included in the
consolidated  statements of operations from the respective dates of acquisition.
The purchase  price is allocated to (i)  tangible  assets,  consisting  of land,
buildings  and  improvements,  and tenant  improvements,  (ii) and  identifiable
intangible  assets generally  consisting of above- and  below-market  leases and
in-place  leases.  We use estimates of fair value based on estimated cash flows,
using  appropriate  discount rates, and other valuation  methods to allocate the
purchase  price to the acquired  tangible  and  intangible  assets.  Liabilities
assumed  generally  consist of mortgage debt on the real estate assets acquired.
Assumed debt with a stated  interest rate that is  significantly  different from
market  interest  rates is recorded at its fair value based on estimated  market
interest rates at the date of acquisition.

     Depreciation is computed on a  straight-line  basis over estimated lives of
40 years for  buildings,  10 to 20 years for  certain  improvements  and 7 to 10
years for  equipment and  fixtures.  Tenant  improvements  are  capitalized  and
depreciated  on a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term of the  related  lease.
Lease-related  intangibles from acquisitions of real estate assets are amortized
over the remaining terms of the related leases.  Any difference between the face
value of the debt assumed and its fair value is  amortized  to interest  expense
over the remaining term of the debt using the effective interest method.

Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets

     We periodically  evaluate  long-lived assets to determine if there has been
any  impairment in their  carrying  values and record  impairment  losses if the
undiscounted  cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than
the assets' carrying amounts or if there are other indicators of impairment.  If
it is  determined  that an impairment  has  occurred,  the excess of the asset's
carrying  value over its  estimated  fair  value will be charged to  operations.
There were no impairment charges in 2003, 20002 and 2001.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In May 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145,  "Rescission of FASB  Statements
No.  4,  44  and  64,   Amendment  of  FASB  Statement  No.  13,  and  Technical
Corrections,"  which  rescinds  SFAS No. 4. As a result,  gains and losses  from
extinguishments of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they
meet the criteria of Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 30 ("APB 30"). We


                                       42
<PAGE>

adopted  SFAS  No.  145 on  January  1,  2003  and have  presented  losses  from
extinguishments of debt as an ordinary expense in all periods presented.

     In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB  Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,  an  interpretation of SFAS No. 5, 57, and
107,  and  rescission  of  FASB   Interpretation  No.  34."  The  interpretation
elaborates  on the  disclosures  to be  made  by a  guarantor  in its  financial
statements.  It also  requires a guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair
value of the obligation  undertaken in issuing the guarantee at the inception of
a guarantee.  We adopted the disclosure provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45
in the fourth  quarter  2002 and  adopted  the  remaining  provisions  effective
January 1, 2003. See Note 17 for disclosures related to our guarantees.

     In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation
of  Variable  Interest   Entities,   an  interpretation  of  ARB  No.  51."  The
interpretation  requires the  consolidation  of entities in which an  enterprise
absorbs a majority of the entity's  expected losses,  receives a majority of the
entity's  expected  residual  returns,  or  both,  as  a  result  of  ownership,
contractual or other financial interests in the entity. Currently,  entities are
generally  consolidated  by an enterprise  when it has a  controlling  financial
interest  through  ownership of a majority voting  interest in the entity.  FASB
Interpretation  No. 46 was revised in December  2003 and the  adoption  date was
postponed  until the first interim or annual period ending after March 15, 2004.
Although we are still  evaluating the impact of the revised  interpretation,  we
believe it is reasonably  possible  that one  unconsolidated  affiliate  that is
currently  accounted  for using the equity  method  may be a  variable  interest
entity under the  provisions  of the  interpretation.  We own a 10% interest and
have a total investment of $18,690 in this unconsolidated affiliate,  which owns
one associated center and two community centers.

     In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities."  SFAS  No.  149  amends  and
clarifies  accounting for derivative  instruments,  including certain derivative
instruments  embedded in other contracts,  and for hedging activities under SFAS
No.  133. In  particular,  SFAS No. 149  clarifies  under what  circumstances  a
contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative
as  discussed  in SFAS No. 133 and it  clarifies  when a  derivative  contains a
financing  component  that warrants  special  reporting in the statement of cash
flows.  SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts  entered into or modified  after
June 30, 2003 and for hedging  relationships  designated after June 30, 2003 and
is to be applied  prospectively.  We did not engage in any activities after June
30,  2003  to  which  SFAS  No.  149  applied.   We  do  not  believe  that  the
implementation  of SFAS No. 149 will  materially  change our  accounting for the
kinds of  derivatives  that we have  typically  obtained  in the  course  of our
regular financing activities.

     In May  2003,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS No.  150,  "Accounting  for  Certain
Financial  Instruments  with  Characteristics  of Both  Liabilities and Equity",
which specifies that instruments  within its scope are obligations of the issuer
and,  therefore,  the  issuer  must  classify  them  as  liabilities.  Financial
instruments within the scope of the pronouncement include mandatorily redeemable
financial  instruments,  obligations to repurchase the issuer's equity shares by
transferring  assets,  and  certain  obligations  to issue a variable  number of
shares. SFAS No. 150 is effective for all financial  instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003. However, on October 29, 2003, the FASB indefinitely
deferred  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  9 and 10 of SFAS No.  150  related to
noncontrolling  interests in limited-life  subsidiaries.  If we were required to
comply  with the  provisions  of  paragraphs  9 and 10 of SFAS 150 as  currently
drafted, we would reclassify amounts currently included in minority interests of
$2,730  and  record  the  minority  partners'  interest  as a  liability  at its
estimated current liquidation amount, which would result in a charge to earnings
of $12,941.  This  liability  would be reviewed  each quarter and changes in its
current liquidation amount recorded through interest expense.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

     In the last three years,  inflation has not had a significant impact on our
operations  because of the  relatively  low inflation  rate.  Substantially  all
tenant leases do, however,  contain  provisions  designed to protect us from the
impact of inflation.  These  provisions  include clauses  enabling us to receive
percentage  rent based on tenants'  gross  sales,  which  generally  increase as
prices rise, and/or escalation  clauses,  which generally  increase rental rates


                                       43
<PAGE>

during the terms of the leases. In addition, many of the leases are for terms of
less than 10 years  which may  provide us the  opportunity  to replace  existing
leases  with new leases at higher base  and/or  percentage  rent if rents of the
existing  leases are below the then  existing  market  rate.  Most of the leases
require the tenants to pay their share of operating  expenses,  including common
area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, which reduces our exposure to
increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

     Funds From  Operations  ("FFO") is a widely used  measure of the  operating
performance of real estate companies that  supplements net income  determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  The National
Association  of Real  Estate  Investment  Trusts  ("NAREIT")  defines FFO as net
income  (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses on sales of
operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization,  and after adjustments
for   unconsolidated   partnerships   and  joint   ventures.   Adjustments   for
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated on the same basis.
We define  FFO  available  for  distribution  as  defined  above by NAREIT  less
dividends  on preferred  stock.  During the first  quarter of 2003,  we began to
include  gains and  losses  on sales of  outparcels  in FFO to  comply  with the
Securities  and Exchange  Commission's  rules  related to disclosure of non-GAAP
financial measures. FFO for prior periods has been restated to include gains and
losses on sales of outparcels.  Our method of  calculating  FFO may be different
from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such
other REITs.

     We believe  that FFO  provides an  additional  indicator  of the  operating
performance of our properties without giving effect to real estate  depreciation
and  amortization,  which  assumes  the  value of real  estate  assets  declines
predictably over time. Since values of  well-maintained  real estate assets have
historically  risen  with  market  conditions,  we  believe  that  FFO  enhances
investors'  understanding  of our  operating  performance.  The use of FFO as an
indicator of financial  performance  is influenced not only by the operations of
our  properties  and  interest  rates,  but  also  by  our  capital   structure.
Accordingly,  FFO will be one of the significant factors considered by the board
of directors  in  determining  the amount of cash  distributions  the  Operating
Partnership will make to its partners, including the REIT.

     FFO does not represent cash flows from  operations as defined by accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States,  is  not  necessarily
indicative  of cash  available  to fund all cash flow  needs and  should  not be
considered  as an  alternative  to net income for  purposes  of  evaluating  our
operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.

     FFO increased 15.3% in 2003 to $271.6 million compared to $235.5 million in
2002. The New Properties and the Newly Consolidated  Properties  generated 62.7%
of the growth in FFO. Consistently high portfolio occupancy, increases in rental
rates from renewal and replacement leasing and increased recoveries of operating
expenses accounted for the remaining 37.3% growth in FFO.

ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The Company has exposure to interest rate risk on its debt  obligations and
derivative financial  instruments.  We use derivative  financial  instruments to
manage exposure to changes in interest rates and not for  speculative  purposes.
The Company's  interest rate risk  management  policy  requires that  derivative
instruments be used for hedging purposes only and that they be entered into only
with  major  financial  institutions  based on their  credit  ratings  and other
factors.

     Based  on  our  proportionate  share  of  consolidated  and  unconsolidated
variable-rate debt at December 31, 2003, a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest
rates on variable  rate debt would  increase  or  decrease  annual cash flows by
approximately $2.8 million and, after the effect of capitalized interest, annual
earnings by approximately $2.7 million.

     Based on our proportionate  share of total  consolidated and unconsolidated
debt at December 31, 2003, a 0.5% increase in interest  rates would decrease the
fair value of debt by  approximately  $57.5  million,  while a 0.5%  decrease in
interest  rates would  increase  the fair value of debt by  approximately  $59.3
million.

     The Company had one interest  rate cap  agreement of 5.50% on $40.0 million
of  variable-rate  debt.  The interest rate cap matures in May 2004 and its fair
value was zero at December 31, 2003.

     As of the end of the period  covered by this annual  report,  an evaluation
was performed under the supervision of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer and with the participation of the Company's  management,
of the  effectiveness  of the design and operation of the  Company's  disclosure
controls and  procedures  pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.  Based upon that
evaluation,  the Chief Executive  Officer and Chief Financial  Officer concluded
that the Company's  disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  No change
in the Company's  internal control over financial  reporting occurred during the
fourth  fiscal  quarter  of the  period  covered  by  this  annual  report  that
materially affected,  or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



To CBL & Associates Properties, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CBL & Associates
Properties,  Inc. (a Delaware  corporation)  and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2003  and  2002,  and  the  related   consolidated   statements  of  operations,
shareholders'  equity and cash  flows for each of the three  years in the period
ended  December  31, 2003.  Our audits also  included  the  financial  statement
schedules  listed  in the  Index  at Item 15.  These  financial  statements  and
financial   statement   schedules  are  the   responsibility  of  the  Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects,  the financial  position of CBL & Associates  Properties,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the United States of America.  Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedules,  when  considered  in  relation to the basic  consolidated  financial
statements  taken  as a whole,  present  fairly  in all  material  respects  the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 4 to the financial statements, in 2002, the Company changed
its method of accounting for discontinued  operations to conform to Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in thousands, except share data)

NOTE 1.  ORGANIZATION

     CBL & Associates  Properties,  Inc. ("CBL"), a Delaware  corporation,  is a
self-managed,  self-administered,  fully integrated real estate investment trust
("REIT") that is engaged in the ownership,  development,  acquisition,  leasing,
management and operation of regional shopping malls and community centers. CBL's
shopping center  properties are located  primarily in the Southeast and Midwest,
as well as in select markets in other regions of the United States.

     CBL conducts  substantially  all of its  business  through CBL & Associates
Limited  Partnership  (the "Operating  Partnership").  At December 31, 2003, the
Operating  Partnership  owned  controlling  interests in 56 regional  malls,  21
associated  centers (each adjacent to a regional  shopping  mall),  17 community
centers  and  CBL's  corporate  office  building.   The  Operating   Partnership
consolidates  the  financial  statements  of  all  entities  in  which  it has a
controlling financial interest.  The Operating Partnership owned non-controlling
interests  in four  regional  malls,  two  associated  centers and 42  community
centers. Because major decisions such as the acquisition, sale or refinancing of
principal partnership or joint venture assets must be approved by one or more of
the  other  partners,   the  Operating   Partnership   does  not  control  these
partnerships and joint ventures and, accordingly, accounts for these investments
using the equity method. The Operating  Partnership had two malls, both owned in
joint ventures,  three mall  expansions,  one associated  center,  two community
centers and one community  center  expansion under  construction at December 31,
2003.  The  Operating   Partnership   also  holds  options  to  acquire  certain
development properties owned by third parties.

     CBL is the 100% owner of two qualified REIT  subsidiaries,  CBL Holdings I,
Inc. and CBL Holdings II, Inc. At December 31, 2003,  CBL Holdings I, Inc.,  the
sole  general  partner  of the  Operating  Partnership,  owned  a  1.7%  general
partnership  interest in the  Operating  Partnership  and CBL  Holdings II, Inc.
owned a 52.9% limited  partnership  interest for a combined interest held by CBL
of 54.6%.

     The minority interest in the Operating Partnership is held primarily by CBL
& Associates,  Inc. and its affiliates (collectively "CBL's Predecessor") and by
affiliates of The Richard E. Jacobs Group,  Inc.  ("Jacobs").  CBL's Predecessor
contributed their interests in certain real estate properties and joint ventures
to the Operating Partnership in exchange for a limited partnership interest when
the Operating  Partnership was formed in November 1993. Jacobs contributed their
interests in certain real estate  properties and joint ventures to the Operating
Partnership  in exchange for a limited  partnership  interest when the Operating
Partnership  acquired  Jacobs'  interests in 23  properties  in January 2001. At
December 31, 2003, CBL's Predecessor owned a 15.8% limited partnership interest,
Jacobs owned a 21.5%  limited  partnership  interest and third  parties owned an
8.1%  limited  partnership   interest  in  the  Operating   Partnership.   CBL's
Predecessor  also owned 2.3 million shares of CBL's common stock at December 31,
2003, for a combined total interest of 20.0% in the Operating Partnership.

     The  Operating   Partnership   conducts  CBL's   property   management  and
development   activities  through  CBL  &  Associates   Management,   Inc.  (the
"Management  Company")  to comply  with  certain  requirements  of the  Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  The Operating  Partnership has a
controlling  financial interest in the Management Company based on the following
factors:

     |X|  The Operating  Partnership  holds 100% of the preferred stock and owns
          6% of  the  common  stock  of  the  Management  Company.  Through  its
          ownership of the preferred  stock,  the Operating  Partnership has the
          right to  perpetually  receive  95% of the  economic  benefits  of the
          Management Company's operations.

     |X|  The Operating Partnership provides all of the operating capital of the
          Management Company.

                                       60
<PAGE>

     |X|  The  Management  Company  does not perform any  material  services for
          entities  in which  the  Operating  Partnership  is not a  significant
          investor.

     |X|  The remaining 94% of the Management Company's common stock is owned by
          individuals  who  are  directors  and/or  officers  of CBL  (with  the
          exception of one individual who is a member of the immediate family of
          a director of CBL) and whose  interests are aligned with those of CBL.
          These  individuals  contributed  nominal amounts of equity in exchange
          for their interests in the Management Company's common stock.

     |X|  All of the members of the Management  Company's Board of Directors are
          members of CBL's Board of Directors.

     All  of  these  factors  result  in  the  Operating  Partnership  having  a
controlling financial interest in the Management Company and,  accordingly,  the
Management Company is treated as a consolidated subsidiary.

     CBL, the Operating  Partnership and the Management Company are collectively
referred to herein as "the Company." All significant  intercompany  balances and
transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated presentation.

NOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Real Estate Assets
------------------
     The Company capitalizes predevelopment project costs paid to third parties.
All  previously  capitalized  predevelopment  costs are  expensed  when it is no
longer  probable  that the project  will be  completed.  Once  development  of a
project commences, all direct costs incurred to construct the project, including
interest and real estate taxes, are capitalized.  Additionally,  certain general
and administrative  expenses are allocated to the projects and capitalized based
on the amount of time  applicable  personnel  work on the  development  project.
Ordinary  repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Major  replacements
and  improvements  are capitalized and depreciated  over their estimated  useful
lives.

     All acquired real estate assets have been  accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting and accordingly,  the results of operations are included in
the  consolidated   statements  of  operations  from  the  respective  dates  of
acquisition.  The Company  allocates the purchase price to (i) tangible  assets,
consisting of land,  buildings and improvements,  and tenant  improvements,  and
(ii)  identifiable  intangible,   assets  generally  consisting  of  above-  and
below-market  leases and in-place leases,  which are included in other assets in
the  consolidated  balance sheet. The Company uses estimates of fair value based
on estimated cash flows,  using appropriate  discount rates, and other valuation
techniques  to  allocate  the  purchase  price  to  the  acquired  tangible  and
intangible assets. Liabilities assumed generally consist of mortgage debt on the
real estate assets  acquired.  Assumed debt with a stated  interest rate that is
significantly  different from market interest rates for similar debt instruments
is recorded at its fair value based on estimated  market  interest  rates at the
date of acquisition.

     Depreciation is computed on a  straight-line  basis over estimated lives of
40 years for  buildings,  10 to 20 years for  certain  improvements  and 7 to 10
years for  equipment and  fixtures.  Tenant  improvements  are  capitalized  and
depreciated  on a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term of the  related  lease.
Lease-related  intangibles from acquisitions of real estate assets are amortized
over the remaining terms of the related leases.  Any difference between the face
value of the debt assumed and its fair value is  amortized  to interest  expense
over the remaining term of the debt using the effective interest method.

     The Company's acquired intangibles and their balance sheet  classifications
as of December 31, 2003, are summarized as follows:

     In-place leases                                        19,945              (686)
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities:
     Below-market leases                                    12,975              (539)
</TABLE>

     The total net  amortization  expense of acquired  intangibles  for the next
five succeeding  years will be $1,833 in 2004,  $1,833 in 2005,  $1,812 in 2006,
$1,938 in 2007 and $2,214 in 2008.

     Total interest expense  capitalized was $5,974,  $5,109 and $5,860 in 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets
-----------------------------------
     The Company  evaluates the carrying  value of long-lived  assets to be held
and used when  events or changes in  circumstances  warrant  such a review.  The
carrying value of a long-lived  asset is considered  impaired when its estimated
future  undiscounted  cash  flows are less  than its  carrying  value.  If it is
determined that an impairment has occurred,  the excess of the asset's  carrying
value over its estimated fair value will be charged to operations. There were no
impairment charges in 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
-------------------------
     The  Company   considers  all  highly  liquid   investments  with  original
maturities of three months or less as cash equivalents.

Deferred  Financing Costs
-------------------------
     Net deferred  financing  costs of $10,808 and $9,767 were included in other
assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002,  respectively.  Deferred  financing  costs
include  fees and  costs  incurred  to obtain  financing  and are  amortized  to
interest  expense  over the terms of the  related  notes  payable.  Amortization
expense was $3,268,  $4,114,  and $4,766 in 2003,  2002 and 2001,  respectively.
Accumulated  amortization  was $5,030 and $6,559 as of  December  2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Revenue Recognition
-------------------
     Minimum  rental   revenue  from   operating   leases  is  recognized  on  a
straight-line  basis  over the  initial  terms of the  related  leases.  Certain
tenants  are  required to pay  percentage  rent if their  sales  volumes  exceed
thresholds specified in their lease agreements. Percentage rent is recognized as
revenue when the thresholds are achieved and the amounts become determinable.

     The Company  receives  reimbursements  from tenants for real estate  taxes,
insurance, common area maintenance,  and other recoverable operating expenses as
provided  in the lease  agreements.  Tenant  reimbursements  are  recognized  as
revenue  in the period the  related  operating  expenses  are  incurred.  Tenant
reimbursements  related to certain  capital  expenditures  are billed to tenants
over periods of 5 to 15 years and are recognized as revenue when billed.

     The Company  receives  management,  leasing and development fees from third
parties  and  unconsolidated  affiliates.  Management  fees  are  charged  as  a
percentage  of  revenues  (as  defined  in the  management  agreement)  and  are
recognized as revenue when earned. Development fees are recognized as revenue on


                                       62
<PAGE>

a pro rata basis over the development period. Leasing fees are charged for newly
executed  leases and lease  renewals and are  recognized as revenue when earned.
Development and leasing fees received from unconsolidated  affiliates during the
development  period  are  recognized  as  revenue  only  to  the  extent  of the
third-party  partners' ownership  interest.  Development and leasing fees during
the  development  period to the extent of the Company's  ownership  interest are
recorded  as a  reduction  to the  Company's  investment  in the  unconsolidated
affiliate.

Gain on Sales of Real Estate Assets
-----------------------------------
     Gains on sales of real estate assets are  recognized  when it is determined
that  the  sale  has  been  consummated,  the  buyer's  initial  and  continuing
investment  is adequate,  the  Company's  receivable,  if any, is not subject to
future  subordination,  and the buyer has assumed the usual risks and rewards of
ownership of the asset. When the Company has an ownership interest in the buyer,
gain is recognized to the extent of the third party partner's ownership interest
and the portion of the gain attributable to the Company's  ownership interest is
deferred.

Income Taxes
------------
     The Company is qualified  as a REIT under the  provisions  of the Code.  To
maintain qualification as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least
90% of its taxable income to shareholders and meet certain other requirements.

     As a REIT, the Company is generally not liable for federal corporate income
taxes.  If the  Company  fails to qualify  as a REIT in any  taxable  year,  the
Company will be subject to federal and state income taxes on its taxable  income
at regular  corporate tax rates. Even if the Company maintains its qualification
as a REIT,  the Company  may be subject to certain  state and local taxes on its
income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed
income. State income taxes were not material in 2003, 2002 and 2001.

     The Company  had a net  deferred  tax asset at December  31, 2003 and 2002,
which consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards,  that was reduced
to zero by a valuation allowance because of uncertainty about the realization of
the net deferred tax asset considering all available evidence.

Derivative Financial Instruments
--------------------------------
     The Company records derivative financial  instruments as either an asset or
liability  measured at the instrument's  fair value. Any fair value  adjustments
affect  either  shareholders'  equity or net income  depending  on  whether  the
derivative  instrument  qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so,
the nature of the hedging activity. See Note 15 for more information.

Concentration of Credit Risk
----------------------------
     The  Company's  tenants  include  national,  regional and local  retailers.
Financial  instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk
consist primarily of tenant  receivables.  The Company generally does not obtain
collateral or other security to support financial  instruments subject to credit
risk, but monitors the credit standing of tenants.

     The Company derives a substantial portion of its rental income from various
national and regional retail companies;  however,  no single tenant collectively
accounts for more than 5.4% of the Company's total revenues.

Earnings Per Share
------------------
     Basic  earnings  per share  ("EPS")  is  computed  by  dividing  net income


                                       63
<PAGE>

available to common  shareholders by the weighted average number of unrestricted
common shares  outstanding  for the period.  Diluted EPS assumes the issuance of
common stock for all potential dilutive common shares  outstanding.  The limited
partners' rights to convert their minority interest in the Operating Partnership
into shares of common stock are not dilutive (Note 9). The following  summarizes
the  impact of  potential  dilutive  common  shares on the  denominator  used to
compute earnings per share:

Stock-Based Compensation
------------------------
     Historically, the Company accounted for its stock-based compensation plans,
which are described in Note 19, under the recognition and measurement principles
of Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25 "Accounting  for Stock Issued to
Employees" (APB No. 25) and related Interpretations.  Effective January 1, 2003,
the Company elected to begin recording the expense associated with stock options
granted after January 1, 2003,  on a  prospective  basis in accordance  with the
fair value and  transition  provisions  of SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting  for Stock
Based  Compensation",  as amended by SFAS No. 148,  "Accounting  for Stock-Based
Compensation  - Transition  and  Disclosure - An Amendment of FASB Statement No.
123." There were no stock  options  granted  during the year ended  December 31,
2003.

     No stock-based  compensation expense related to stock options granted prior
to January 1, 2003, has been  reflected in net income since all options  granted
had an exercise  price equal to the fair value of the Company's  common stock on
the date of grant. Therefore,  stock-based  compensation expense included in net
income available to common shareholders in 2003, 2002 and 2001 is less than that
which would have been  recognized  if the fair value  method had been applied to
all  stock-based  awards since the effective date of SFAS No. 123. The following
table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company
had  applied  the fair  value  recognition  provisions  of SFAS  No.  123 to all
outstanding and unvested awards in each period:

</TABLE>

     The per share weighted  average fair value of stock options  granted during
2002 and 2001 was $3.50 and $1.75, respectively.

Comprehensive Income
--------------------
     Comprehensive  income includes all changes in  shareholders'  equity during
the  period,  except  those  resulting  from  investments  by  shareholders  and
distributions to shareholders.

Use of Estimates
----------------
     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in conformity  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and  liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial  statements,  and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses  during the reported  period.  Actual  results  could differ from those
estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
--------------------------------
     In May 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145,  "Rescission of FASB  Statements
No.  4,  44  and  64,   Amendment  of  FASB  Statement  No.  13,  and  Technical
Corrections,"  which  rescinds  SFAS No. 4. As a result,  gains and losses  from
extinguishments of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they
meet the criteria of Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No. 30 ("APB 30"). The
Company  adopted SFAS No. 145 on January 1, 2003 and has  presented  losses from
extinguishments of debt as an ordinary expense in all periods presented.

     In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB  Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,  an  interpretation of SFAS No. 5, 57, and
107,  and  rescission  of  FASB   Interpretation  No.  34."  The  interpretation
elaborates  on the  disclosures  to be  made  by a  guarantor  in its  financial
statements.  It also  requires a guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair
value of the obligation  undertaken in issuing the guarantee at the inception of
a  guarantee.   The  Company   adopted  the   disclosure   provisions   of  FASB
Interpretation  No. 45 in the fourth  quarter  2002 and  adopted  the  remaining
provisions effective January 1, 2003. See Note 17 for disclosures related to the
Company's guarantees.

     In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation
of  Variable  Interest   Entities,   an  interpretation  of  ARB  No.  51."  The
interpretation  requires the  consolidation  of entities in which an  enterprise
absorbs a majority of the entity's  expected losses,  receives a majority of the
entity's  expected  residual  returns,  or  both,  as  a  result  of  ownership,
contractual or other financial interests in the entity. Currently,  entities are
generally  consolidated  by an enterprise  when it has a  controlling  financial
interest  through  ownership of a majority voting  interest in the entity.  FASB
Interpretation  No. 46 was revised in December  2003 and the  adoption  date was
postponed  until the first interim or annual period ending after March 15, 2004.
Although   the   Company  is  still   evaluating   the  impact  of  the  revised
interpretation,  the  Company  believes  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  one
unconsolidated affiliate that is currently accounted for using the equity method
may be a variable  interest  entity under the provisions of the  interpretation.


                                       65
<PAGE>

The Company owns a 10% interest  and has a total  investment  of $18,690 in this
unconsolidated  affiliate,  which owns one  associated  center and two community
centers.  The Company  consolidates  the results of operations of the Management
Company  based  on the  criteria  described  in  Note  1 and  will  continue  to
consolidate  the  Management  Company  under the  provisions of the revised FASB
Interpretation No. 46.

     In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities."  SFAS  No.  149  amends  and
clarifies  accounting for derivative  instruments,  including certain derivative
instruments  embedded in other contracts,  and for hedging activities under SFAS
No.  133. In  particular,  SFAS No. 149  clarifies  under what  circumstances  a
contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative
as  discussed  in SFAS No. 133 and it  clarifies  when a  derivative  contains a
financing  component  that warrants  special  reporting in the statement of cash
flows.  SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts  entered into or modified  after
June 30, 2003 and for hedging  relationships  designated after June 30, 2003 and
is to be applied  prospectively.  The Company  did not engage in any  activities
after June 30, 2003 to which SFAS No. 149 applied.  The Company does not believe
that the  implementation  of SFAS No. 149 will  materially  change the Company's
accounting for the kinds of derivatives that the Company has typically  obtained
in the course of its regular financing activities.

     In May  2003,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS No.  150,  "Accounting  for  Certain
Financial  Instruments  with  Characteristics  of Both  Liabilities and Equity",
which specifies that instruments  within its scope are obligations of the issuer
and,  therefore,  the  issuer  must  classify  them  as  liabilities.  Financial
instruments within the scope of the pronouncement include mandatorily redeemable
financial  instruments,  obligations to repurchase the issuer's equity shares by
transferring  assets,  and  certain  obligations  to issue a variable  number of
shares. SFAS No. 150 is effective for all financial  instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003. However, on October 29, 2003, the FASB indefinitely
deferred  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  9 and 10 of SFAS No.  150  related to
noncontrolling interests in limited-life subsidiaries. If the Company were to be
required to comply with the  provisions  of  paragraphs  9 and 10 of SFAS 150 as
currently drafted, the Company would be required to reclassify amounts currently
included  in  minority  interests  of $2,730 and record the  minority  partners'
interest as a liability at its estimated current liquidation amount, which would
result in a charge to earnings of $12,941.  This liability  would be required to
be reviewed each quarter and changes in its current  liquidation amount recorded
through interest expense.

Reclassifications
-----------------
     Certain amounts in the 2002 and 2001 consolidated financial statements have
been  reclassified to conform with the current year  presentation.  In 2003, the
Company  recorded  a  reclassification  related  to tenant  reimbursements.  The
reclassification resulted in a decrease in tenant reimbursements revenues and an
equal decrease in property  operating  expenses.  The 2002 and 2001 consolidated
financial  statements reflect decreases of $8,179 and $7,268,  respectively,  in
tenant reimbursements revenues and property operating expenses to conform to the
current year presentation.

computed  using an  estimated  market  interest  rate of  5.10%,  since the debt

NOTE 4.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

     On January 1, 2002, the Company  adopted SFAS No. 144,  "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets." SFAS No. 144 supersedes  SFAS No.
121 and requires  that  long-lived  assets that are to be disposed of by sale be
measured  at the lower of book value or fair value less costs to sell.  SFAS No.
144 retains the  fundamental  provisions of SFAS No. 121 for (i) recognition and
measurement of the impairment of long-lived  assets to be held and used and (ii)
measurement of long-lived  assets to be disposed by sale.  SFAS No. 144 broadens
the definition of what constitutes a discontinued  operation and how the results
of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented.

     The  provisions  of  SFAS  No.  144  have  been  applied  prospectively  to
dispositions  that occurred  after January 1, 2002.  Additionally,  the disposed
assets'  results  of  operations  for 2002 and 2001  have been  reclassified  to
discontinued operations to conform to the current year presentation.

     During 2003, the Company sold six community centers for a total sales price
$17,280 and recognized a net gain on  discontinued  operations of $4,042.  Total
revenues from these  community  centers were $1,528,  $2,093 and $2,549 in 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

                                       69
<PAGE>

     During 2002, the Company sold five community centers and an office building
for a total  sales price of $36,800 and  recognized  a net gain on  discontinued
operations of $372.  Total revenues for these  properties were $2,331 and $4,844
in 2002 and 2001, respectively.

     In general,  contributions  and  distributions of capital or cash flows and
allocations  of income and expense are made on a pro rata basis in proportion to
the equity interest held by each general or limited  partner.  All debt on these
properties  is  non-recourse.  See Note 17 for a description  of guarantees  the
Company has issued related to certain unconsolidated affiliates.

2003 Activity
-------------
     On September 24, 2003,  the Company  formed  Galileo  America LLC ("Galileo
America"),  a joint  venture with Galileo  America REIT,  the U.S.  affiliate of
Australia-based  Galileo America Shopping Trust, to invest in community  centers
throughout the United States. The arrangement  provides for the Company to sell,
in three  phases,  its  interests in 51  community  centers for a total price of
$516,000 plus a 10% interest in Galileo America.

     The first phase of the  transaction  closed on October 23,  2003,  when the
Company  sold its  interests  in 41  community  centers to Galileo  America  for
$393,925, which consisted of $250,705 in cash, the retirement of $24,922 of debt
on one of the community centers, a note receivable of $4,813,  Galileo America's
assumption  of  $93,037  in debt and  $20,448  representing  the  Company's  10%
interest in Galileo  America.  The Company  used the net proceeds to fund escrow
amounts to be used in like-kind  exchanges and to reduce outstanding  borrowings
under the Company's credit facilities.  The Company recognized a gain of $71,886
from  the  first  phase  and  deferred  gain of  $7,987,  representing  the gain
attributable  to the  Company's  10%  interest  in  Galileo  America.  The  note
receivable was paid subsequent to December 31, 2003.

     The Company,  as tenant, has entered,  or will enter into,  separate master
lease agreements with Galileo America,  as landlord,  covering certain spaces in
certain of the properties sold or, to be sold, to the joint venture.  Under each
master  lease  agreement,  the Company is  obligated  to pay Galileo  America an
agreed-upon  minimum  annual  rent,  plus  a  pro  rata  share  of  common  area
maintenance expenses and real estate taxes, for each designated space for a term
of five years from the  applicable  property's  closing  date. If the Company is
able to lease a designated space to a third party,  then the amounts owed by the
Company under the master lease will be reduced by the amounts received under the
third party  lease.  If the amounts  under the third party lease are equal to or
greater  than the  Company's  obligation  for the full term of the master  lease
agreement,  then the Company's  obligation is zero.  When a third party lease is
executed that releases the Company from its obligation,  Galileo America assumes
the credit risk related to the third party lease.  This arrangement is in effect
until the end of the five-year term of the master lease.  Therefore,  if a third
party lease expires  before the  expiration  of the master lease term,  then the
Company  is  obligated  under  the  original  terms  of the  master  lease.  Two
properties  in the first  phase are  subject  to master  lease  agreements.  The
Company has recorded a liability  of $2,184 at December 31, 2003,  for the total
amounts to be paid over the remaining terms of the master lease obligations. The
Company  will reduce the  liability  for the master  lease  obligation  and will
recognize  gain to the extent it obtains third party leases that are  sufficient
to satisfy the master lease obligation.

     The  Company  may  also  receive  up to  $8,000  of  additional  contingent
consideration  if, as the  exclusive  manager  of the  properties,  it  achieves
certain leasing  objectives  related to spaces that were vacant, or projected to
soon be vacant, at the time the first phase closed. As of December 31, 2003, the
Company had earned  $3,833 for leasing  objectives  that were met as of December
31, 2003, of which $3,450 was  recognized as gain on sales of real estate assets
and $383,  representing the portion  attributable to the Company's 10% ownership
interest,  was recorded as a reduction of the  Company's  investment  in Galileo
America.

     The second  phase of the  transaction  closed on January 5, 2004,  when the
Company sold its interest in six community centers for $92,375,  which consisted
of $62,687 in cash,  the  retirement  of $25,953 of debt on one of the community
centers,  the joint  venture's  assumption of $2,816 of debt and closing cost of
$919.  The  real  estate  assets  and  related  mortgage  notes  payable  of the
properties  in the  second  phase  have  been  reflected  as held for sale as of
December 31, 2003. The Company ceased  recording  depreciation  expense on these


                                       71
<PAGE>

assets on October 23, 2003, the date that it was determined these assets met the
criteria to be reflected as held for sale.

     The Company also entered into a master lease agreement on one of the second
phase  properties  that totals $7,305.  As of December 31, 2003, the Company has
executed  leases with tenants for certain spaces that will reduce this amount by
$4,855.  These tenants are  scheduled to open at various  dates between  January
2004 and May 2004.

     The third phase is scheduled to close in January 2005 and will include five
community centers.  The total purchase price for these community centers will be
$86,800.

     Pursuant  to a  long-term  agreement,  the  Company  will be the  exclusive
manager for all of the joint venture's properties in the United States, and will
be entitled to management,  leasing, acquisition,  disposition, asset management
and financing fees.

2002 Activity
-------------
     In February  2002, the Company  contributed  its interests in two community
centers and one associated center to PPG Venture I Limited Partnership,  a joint
venture with a third party, and retained a 10% interest. The total consideration
of $63,030 consisted of cash of $46,000 and the Company's retained interest. The
Company  deferred  the  gain of  $10,983  from  the  transaction  since  certain
restrictions  included in the joint venture  agreement related to the subsequent
sale of the properties  demonstrate the Company's  continuing  involvement.  The
deferred gain is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

     In March 2002,  the Company  acquired an additional 2% interest in Kentucky
Oaks Mall Company,  an  additional  17% interest in Madison Joint Venture and an
additional  31% interest in Columbia  Mall Company as discussed in Note 3. Since
the additional  interest in Columbia Mall Company resulted in the Company having
a 79%  controlling  interest in that joint  venture,  the  Company  discontinued
accounting for it using the equity method and began  consolidating  it as of the
date the additional 31% interest was acquired.

     During  2002,  the Company  entered  into three joint  ventures  with third
parties to develop two malls, Imperial Valley Mall and Coastal Grand.

2001 Activity
-------------
     In January 2001, the Company  acquired a 48% interest in Kentucky Oaks Mall
Company, Columbia Joint Venture and Madison Joint Venture in connection with the
first stage of the Jacobs' transaction discussed in Note 3.

     As  discussed  in Note 3, the  Company  discontinued  the equity  method of
accounting for the  partnership  that owns Madison Square Mall after the Company
acquired the remaining  ownership  interest in that  partnership  on January 31,
2001.

     The secured lines of credit are secured by 19 of the Company's  properties,
which had an  aggregate  net  carrying  value of $375,198 at December  31, 2003.
Borrowings  under the secured  lines of credit had a weighted  average  interest
rate of 2.17% at December 31, 2003.

Letters of Credit

     The Company had $17,343  outstanding  for letters of credit under the above

December 31, 2003.

Covenants and Restrictions
--------------------------
     The secured and unsecured line of credit  agreements  contain,  among other
restrictions,  certain financial  covenants including the maintenance of certain
financial coverage ratios,  minimum net worth  requirements,  and limitations on
cash flow  distributions.  The Company was in compliance  with all covenants and
restrictions on its lines of credit at December 31, 2003.

     Seventeen malls,  six associated  centers and the office building are owned
by special  purpose  entities  that are included in the  Company's  consolidated
financial statements.  The sole business purpose of the special purpose entities
is to own and  operate  these  properties,  each of  which  is  encumbered  by a
commercial-mortgage-backed-securities  loan.  The real  estate and other  assets
owned by these special purpose entities are restricted under the loan agreements
in that they are not available to settle other debts of the Company. However, so
long as the loans  are not under an event of  default,  as  defined  in the loan
agreements,  the cash  flows  from  these  properties,  after  payments  of debt
service,  operating expenses and reserves, are available for distribution to the
Company.

Debt Maturities
---------------
     As of December 31, 2003, the scheduled  principal  payments on all mortgage
and other notes payable,  including  construction loans and lines of credit, are

NOTE 8.  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

Common Stock
------------
     In March 2002, the Company completed an offering of 3,352,770 shares of its
$0.01 par value common  stock at $34.55 per share.  The net proceeds of $114,705
were used to repay  outstanding  borrowings  under the Company's lines of credit
and to retire debt on certain operating properties.

Preferred Stock
---------------
     In June  1998,  the  Company  issued  2,875,000  shares  of 9.0%  Series  A
Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred  Stock") with a
face value of $25.00 per share in a public  offering.  In June 2002, the Company
purchased 200,000 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock for $5,093. On November
28, 2003, the Company redeemed the remaining 2,675,000 outstanding shares of the
Series A Preferred  Stock at its face value of $25.00 per share plus accrued and
unpaid  dividends.  In connection  with the redemption of the Series A Preferred
Stock,  the Company  recorded a charge of $2,181 to  write-off  direct  issuance
costs that were recorded as a reduction of additional  paid-in  capital when the
Series A  Preferred  Stock was  issued.  The  charge is  included  in  preferred
dividends in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

     In June 2002,  the Company  completed  an offering of  2,000,000  shares of
8.75% Series B Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Stock (the "Series B Preferred
Stock"),  having a par value of $.01 per share,  at $50.00  per  share.  The net
proceeds of $96,370 were used to reduce outstanding balances under the Company's
lines of credit and to retire term loans on several properties.

     The  dividends on the Series B Preferred  Stock are  cumulative  and accrue
from the date of issue and are payable  quarterly in arrears at a rate of $4.375
per share per annum. The Series B Preferred Stock has no stated maturity, is not
subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption, and is not convertible into
any other  securities  of the  Company.  The Series B Preferred  Stock cannot be
redeemed by the Company prior to June 14, 2007. After that date, the Company may
redeem shares,  in whole or in part, at any time for a cash redemption  price of
$50.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends.

     On August 22, 2003, the Company  issued  4,600,000  depositary  shares in a
public  offering,  each  representing  one-tenth  of a share of  7.75%  Series C
Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred Stock (the "Series C Preferred  Stock") with a
par value of $0.01 per share.  The Series C  Preferred  Stock has a  liquidation
preference of $250.00 per share ($25.00 per depositary share).

     The dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock are  cumulative,  accrue from
the date of issuance  and are payable  quarterly in arrears at a rate of $19.375
per share ($1.9375 per depositary share) per annum. The Series C Preferred Stock
has no  stated  maturity,  is not  subject  to any  sinking  fund  or  mandatory
redemption  and is not  redeemable  before August 22, 2008.  The net proceeds of
$111,227 were used to partially  fund certain  acquisitions  discussed in Note 3
and to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Company's lines of credit.

NOTE 9.  MINORITY INTERESTS

     Minority interests represent (i) the aggregate  partnership interest in the
Operating  Partnership  that is not owned by the Company and (ii) the  aggregate
ownership  interest in 11 of the Company's  shopping  center  properties that is
held by third parties.

Minority Interest in Operating Partnership
------------------------------------------
     The minority interest in the Operating Partnership is represented by common
units and special common units of limited partnership  interest in the Operating
Partnership (the "Operating Partnership Units") that the Company does not own.

     The  assets  and  liabilities  allocated  to  the  Operating  Partnership's
minority  interest  are based on their  ownership  percentage  of the  Operating
Partnership  at  December  31,  2003  and  2002.  The  ownership  percentage  is
determined  by dividing  the number of Operating  Partnership  Units held by the
minority  interest  at  December  31,  2003  and  2002  by the  total  Operating
Partnership  Units  outstanding  at  December  31, 2003 and 2002.  The  minority
interest  ownership  percentage  in  assets  and  liabilities  of the  Operating
Partnership was 45.4% and 46.3% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     Income is allocated to the Operating  Partnership's minority interest based
on their weighted average ownership during the year. The ownership percentage is
determined  by dividing the  weighted  average  number of Operating  Partnership
Units held by the  minority  interest by the total  weighted  average  number of
Operating Partnership Units outstanding during the year.

     A change in the number of shares of common stock or  Operating  Partnership
Units  changes  the  percentage  ownership  of all  partners  of  the  Operating
Partnership.  An Operating  Partnership Unit is considered to be equivalent to a
share of common stock since it generally is redeemable for cash or shares of the
Company's common stock. As a result, an allocation is made between shareholders'
equity and minority  interest in the Operating  Partnership in the  accompanying
balance sheet to reflect the change in ownership of the Operating  Partnership's
underlying  equity  when  there is a  change  in the  number  of  shares  and/or
Operating Partnership Units outstanding.

     The total minority  interest in the Operating  Partnership was $523,779 and
$497,832 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Minority Interest in Operating Partnership-Conversion Rights
------------------------------------------------------------
     Under  the  terms  of  the  Operating   Partnership's  limited  partnership
agreement,  each of the  limited  partners  has the right to  exchange  all or a
portion of its  partnership  interests  for shares of CBL's  common stock or, at
CBL's election, their cash equivalent.  When an exchange occurs, CBL assumes the
limited partner's ownership interests in the Operating  Partnership.  The number
of  shares of common  stock  received  by a  limited  partner  of the  Operating
Partnership  upon exercise of its exchange rights will be equal on a one-for-one
basis to the number of partnership  units exchanged by the limited partner.  The
amount of cash received by the limited partner,  if CBL elects to pay cash, will
be based on the five-day  trailing  average of the trading  price at the time of
exercise of the shares of common stock that would  otherwise  have been received
by the  limited  partner  in  the  exchange.  Neither  the  limited  partnership
interests in the Operating Partnership nor the shares of common stock of CBL are
subject to any right of mandatory redemption.

     The  Operating  Partnership  issued  13,159,402  special  common  units  in
connection with acquisitions discussed in Notes 3 and 5. After January 31, 2004,
holders of the special common units may exchange them for shares of common stock
or cash.  The Company  has the right to elect the form of  payment.  The special
common units receive a minimum  distribution  of $2.9025 per unit per year. When


                                       76
<PAGE>

the  distribution  on the common units  exceeds  $2.9025 per unit per year,  the
special  common  units  will  receive a  distribution  equal to that paid on the
common units.

     The Operating  Partnership issued 1,144,034 common units in connection with
acquisitions  discussed  in Notes 3 and 5. The 118,695  common  units  issued in
connection with the acquisition of Panama City Mall,  which is discussed in Note
3, receive a minimum annual dividend of $3.375 per unit until May 2012. When the
distribution  on the common units  exceeds  $3.375 per unit,  these common units
will  receive  a   distribution   equal  to  that  paid  on  the  common  units.
Additionally, if the annual distribution on the common units should ever be less
than $2.22 per unit,  the $3.375 per unit dividend will be reduced by the amount
the per unit distribution is less than $2.22 per unit.

     The Company  purchased  460,083 common units from a former executive of the
Company who retired in 1997 for $21,013 during 2003.  During 2002, third parties
converted 446,652 common units to shares of the Company's common stock.

     Outstanding   rights  to  convert  minority   interests  in  the  Operating
Partnership  to common stock were held by the following  parties at December 31,
2003 and 2002:

Minority Interest in Shopping Center Properties
-----------------------------------------------
     The  Company's   consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  assets,
liabilities and results of operations of 11 properties that the Company does not
wholly own. The minority interest in shopping center  properties  represents the
aggregate  ownership  interest of third parties in these  properties.  The total
minority  interests  in  shopping  center  properties  was  $3,652 and $2,681 at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     The assets and liabilities  allocated to the minority  interest in shopping
center properties are based on the third parties' ownership  percentages in each
shopping center  property at December 31, 2003 and 2002.  Income is allocated to
the minority  interest in shopping center properties based on the third parties'
weighted average ownership in each shopping center property during the year.

NOTE 10.  MINIMUM RENTS

     The Company  receives rental income by leasing retail shopping center space
under operating leases.  Future minimum rents are scheduled to be received under

NOTE 15.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to
changes  in  interest  rates.  The  Company  does not use  derivative  financial
instruments  for  speculative   purposes.   The  Company's  interest  rate  risk
management  policy  requires  that  derivative  instruments  be used for hedging
purposes  only  and  that  they  be  entered  into  only  with  major  financial
institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors.

     The Company's  objective in using  derivatives is to manage its exposure to
changes in interest rates. To accomplish this objective,  the Company  primarily
uses  interest  rate swap and cap  agreements  as part of its cash flow  hedging
strategy.

     At December 31, 2003,  the Company had one interest rate cap agreement that
was  already  in place on  $40,000  of  variable-rate  debt that was  assumed in
connection  with the acquisition of Sunrise Mall (see Note 3). The interest rate
cap agreement limits the maximum interest rate at 5.50% and matures in May 2004.
The  interest  rate  cap's fair  value was $0 at both the  acquisition  date and
December 31, 2003.

     Interest rate swap  agreements  designated as cash flow hedges  involve the
receipt of  variable-rate  amounts in exchange for fixed-rate  payments over the
life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying  principal amount.
During  2002,  such  derivatives  were used to hedge  the  variable  cash  flows
associated  with  variable-rate  debt.  Under an interest  rate swap in place at
December 31, 2002,  the Company  received  interest  payments at a rate equal to
LIBOR (1.44% at December  31, 2002) and paid  interest at a fixed rate of 5.83%.
The interest rate swap had a notional  amount of $80,000 and expired  August 30,
2003.

     Effective January 1, 2001, the Company  determined that, with the exception
of two swap  agreements  that  expired  during the first  quarter  of 2001,  the
Company's  derivative   instruments  were  effective  and  qualified  for  hedge
accounting in accordance  with SFAS No. 133. At December 31, 2002,  the interest
rate  swap's fair value of $2,412 was  recorded in accounts  payable and accrued
liabilities.

     The unrealized  gains/losses  recorded in accumulated  other  comprehensive
loss are reclassified to earnings as interest expense when interest payments are
made. This reclassification  correlates with the timing of when hedged items are
recognized in earnings.  The change in net unrealized  gains on cash flow hedges
in 2003 and 2002  reflects  a  reclassification  of net  unrealized  gains  from
accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss to  interest  expense in the  amounts of
$2,397 and $4,387, respectively.

     The Company is exposed to credit  losses if the  counterparty  is unable to
perform under the interest rate swap agreement. However, the Company anticipates
that the  counterparty  will be able to fully satisfy its obligations  under the
contract.  The Company does not obtain  collateral or other  security to support
financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of
counterparties.

NOTE 16.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     CBL's  Predecessor  and certain  officers of the Company have a significant
minority interest in the construction  company that the Company engaged to build
substantially  all of the  Company's  development  properties.  The Company paid
approximately $163,617, $96,185 and $94,300 to the construction company in 2003,
2002, and 2001, respectively,  for construction and development activities.  The
Company had accounts payable to the  construction  company of $8,082 and $16,963
at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     The Management  Company  provides  management  and leasing  services to the
Company's unconsolidated affiliates and other affiliated partnerships.  Revenues
recognized  for these  services  amounted to $1,077,  $2,502 and $1,450 in 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

NOTE 17.  CONTINGENCIES

     The Company is currently  involved in certain litigation that arises in the
ordinary  course  of  business.  It is  management's  opinion  that the  pending
litigation  will not  materially  affect the  financial  position  or results of
operations of the Company.  Additionally,  management  believes  that,  based on
environmental  studies completed to date, any exposure to environmental  cleanup
will not materially  affect the financial  position and results of operations of
the Company.

     The  Company  has  guaranteed  50% of the debt of Parkway  Place  L.P.,  an
unconsolidated  affiliate  in which the Company owns a 45%  interest.  The total
amount  outstanding at December 31, 2003, was $58,470,  of which the Company has
guaranteed $29,235. The Company did not receive a fee for this guaranty.

     Under  the terms of the  partnership  agreement  of Mall of South  Carolina
L.P., an unconsolidated  affiliate in which the Company owns a 50% interest, the
Company has guaranteed 100% of the  construction  debt to be incurred to develop
Coastal  Grand.  The total amount  outstanding at December 31, 2003 was $46,384.
The  Company  received a fee of $1,572 for this  guaranty  during  2003 and will
recognize  $786 of this fee as  revenue  pro rata over the term of the  guaranty
until  it  expires  in May  2006,  which  represents  the  portion  of  the  fee
attributable to the third-party partner's ownership interest. The remaining $786
attributable to the Company's  ownership  interest is recorded as a reduction in
the Company's  investment in the  partnership.  The Company  recognized  $218 of
revenue related to this guaranty during 2003.

     The Company has guaranteed  100% of the debt of Imperial  Valley Mall L.P.,
an unconsolidated  affiliate in which the Company owns a 60% interest. The total
amount  outstanding  at December  31, 2003,  was $418,  of which the Company has
guaranteed $209.

NOTE 18.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The carrying  values of cash and cash  equivalents,  receivables,  accounts
payable and accrued  liabilities  are reasonable  estimates of their fair values
because  of the short  maturity  of these  financial  instruments.  Based on the
interest rates for similar financial instruments, the carrying value of mortgage
notes  receivable is a reasonable  estimation  of fair value.  The fair value of
mortgage and other notes payable was  $3,094,285  and $2,637,219 at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The fair value was calculated by discounting future
cash flows for the notes  payable using  estimated  rates at which similar loans
would be made currently.

NOTE 19.  STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

     The Company  maintains  the CBL & Associates  Properties,  Inc.  1993 Stock
Incentive Plan, as amended, which permits the Company to issue stock options and
common stock to selected officers,  employees and directors of the Company.  The
shares  available  under the plan were  increased  from  4,000,000  to 5,200,000
during  2002.  The  Compensation  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (the
"Committee") administers the plan.

Stock Options
-------------
     Stock options  issued under the plan allow for the purchase of common stock
at the fair  market  value of the  stock on the  date of  grant.  Stock  options
granted to officers and employees vest and become exercisable in installments on
each of the first  five  anniversaries  of the date of grant and expire 10 years
after the date of grant.  Stock  options  granted to  independent  directors are
fully vested upon grant. However, the independent directors may not sell, pledge
or otherwise  transfer  their stock  options  during their board term or for one
year thereafter.

     The Company's  stock option  activity for 2003, 2002 and 2001 is summarized
as follows:

Stock Awards
------------
     Under the plan,  common stock may be awarded either alone,  in addition to,
or in tandem with other stock awards  granted under the plan.  The Committee has
the  authority  to  determine  eligible  persons  to whom  common  stock will be
awarded,  the number of shares to be  awarded,  and the  duration of the vesting
period,  as defined.  The  Committee may also provide for the issuance of common
stock  under the plan on a deferred  basis  pursuant  to  deferred  compensation
arrangements, as described in Note 20.

     In May 2003, the Company  granted awards for 43,225 shares of the Company's
common stock to employees. The terms of the awards allow for a recipient to vest


                                       82
<PAGE>

and receive  shares of common stock in equal  installments  on each of the first
five  anniversaries  of the date of grant.  Under the terms of the  awards,  the
Company pays the recipient  additional  compensation,  in an amount equal to the
dividends  paid on the Company's  common stock,  on the unvested  portion of the
award as if the recipient owned the unvested shares.

     The Company recorded  deferred  compensation of $1,870 when the awards were
granted,  based on the market value of the  Company's  common stock on the grant
date, which was $43.06 per share.  The deferred  compensation is being amortized
on a  straight-line  basis as  compensation  expense over the five-year  vesting
period. The Company  recognized $248 of compensation  expense in 2003 related to
the amortization of deferred compensation. The Company also recorded a reduction
to deferred compensation of $15 for grants that were canceled during 2003.

     During 2003, the Company issued an additional 43,606 shares of common stock
to employees with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $43.01. The shares
vested immediately.

     During  2002,  the  Company  issued  73,228  shares of common  stock with a
weighted  average  grant-date fair value of $35.21 per share.  There were 41,516
shares that vested  immediately.  The  remaining  31,712  shares vest at various
dates from 2003 to 2007.

     During  2001,  the  Company  issued  69,735  shares of common  stock with a
weighted  average  grant-date fair value of $27.62 per share.  There were 44,537
shares of common stock that vested  immediately.  The remaining 25,198 shares of
common stock vest at various dates from 2002 to 2006.

NOTE 20.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

401 (k) Plan
------------
     The Management  Company  maintains a 401(k) profit  sharing plan,  which is
qualified under Section 401(a) and Section 401(k) of the Code to cover employees
of the  Management  Company.  All  employees who have attained the age of 21 and
have  completed at least one year of service are eligible to  participate in the
plan. The plan provides for employer  matching  contributions  on behalf of each
participant equal to 50% of the portion of such participant's  contribution that
does not  exceed  2.5% of such  participant's  compensation  for the plan  year.
Additionally,  the  Management  Company has the  discretion  to make  additional
profit-sharing-type   contributions   not   related  to   participant   elective
contributions. Total contributions by the Management Company were $518, $439 and
$391 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
----------------------------
     The Company  maintains an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible
employees  to acquire  shares of the  Company's  common stock in the open market
without  incurring  brokerage  or  transaction  fees.  Under the plan,  eligible
employees  make  payroll  deductions  that are used to  purchase  shares  of the
Company's  common stock.  The shares are purchased by the fifth  business day of
the month following the month when the deductions were withheld.  The shares are
purchased at the prevailing market price of the stock at the time of purchase.

Deferred Compensation Arrangements
----------------------------------
     The Company has entered into  agreements  with certain of its officers that
allow the officers to defer receipt of selected  salary  increases  and/or bonus
compensation for periods ranging from 5 to 10 years.

     For certain officers,  the deferred compensation  arrangements provide that
when the salary increase or bonus compensation is earned and deferred, shares of
the Company's  common stock  issuable  under the 1993 Stock  Incentive  Plan are
deemed set aside for the amount deferred.  The number of shares deemed set aside


                                       83
<PAGE>

is determined by dividing the amount of compensation  deferred by the fair value
of  the  Company's  common  stock  on  the  deferral  date,  as  defined  in the
arrangements. The shares set aside are deemed to receive dividends equivalent to
those paid on the Company's common stock, which are then deemed to be reinvested
in the  Company's  common  stock  in  accordance  with  the  Company's  dividend
reinvestment plan. When an arrangement terminates, the Company will issue shares
of the Company's common stock to the officer  equivalent to the number of shares
deemed to have accumulated under the officer's arrangement. At December 31, 2003
and 2002, respectively, there were 93,796 and 80,532 shares that were deemed set
aside in accordance with these arrangements.

     For other officers,  the deferred  compensation  arrangements  provide that
their  bonus  compensation  is  deferred  in the form of a note  payable  to the
officer.  Interest  accumulates  on these  notes at  7.0%.  When an  arrangement
terminates,  the note payable  plus  accrued  interest is paid to the officer in
cash.  At  December  31,  2003 and 2002,  respectively,  the  Company  had notes
payable,  including  accrued  interest,  of  $296  and  $319  related  to  these
arrangements.

NOTE 21.  DIVIDENDS

     On October 29,  2003,  the Company  declared a cash  dividend of $0.725 per
share of common stock for the quarter ended  December 31, 2003. The dividend was
paid on January 16, 2004, to shareholders of record as of December 31, 2003. The
total  dividend  of  $21,985  is  included  in  accounts   payable  and  accrued
liabilities at December 31, 2003.

     On October 29, 2003, the Operating  Partnership  declared a distribution of
$18,309 to the  Operating  Partnership's  limited  partners.  This  distribution
represented a distribution of $0.725 per unit for each common unit and $0.726 to
$0.844 per unit for the special common units in the Operating  Partnership.  The
total  distribution is included in accounts  payable and accrued  liabilities at
December 31, 2003.
