     Cautionary  Statement  Relevant  to  Forward-Looking  Information  for  the

     This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking  statements,  such
as information relating to the Company's growth strategy,  projects targeted for
development  or  under   construction,   liquidity  and  capital  resources  and
compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  Such statements are subject
to certain risks and  uncertainties  which could cause actual  results to differ
materially,  including,  but not limited to, those set forth below.  Readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date  hereof.  The  Company  undertakes  no  obligation  to
publicly   revise  these   forward-looking   statements  to  reflect  events  or
circumstances  occurring  after the date hereof or to reflect the  occurrence of
unanticipated events.

                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

Formation of the Company

     CBL &  Associates  Properties,  Inc.  (the  "Company")  is a  self-managed,
self-administered,  fully-integrated real estate company which is engaged in the
ownership,  operation, marketing,  management, leasing, expansion,  development,
redevelopment,  acquisition  and  financing of regional  malls and community and
neighborhood  centers.  The Company was  incorporated on July 13, 1993 under the
laws of the State of Delaware to acquire an interest in substantially all of the
real  estate  properties  owned by CBL &  Associates,  Inc.  and its  affiliates
("CBL") and to provide a public  vehicle  for the  expansion  of CBL's  shopping
center business.

     The  Company  conducts  substantially  all of its  business  through  CBL &
Associates Limited  Partnership,  a Delaware limited partnership (the "Operating
Partnership"), in which the Company owns an indirect 51.1% interest and of which
the Company's  wholly-owned  subsidiary is the sole general  partner.  To comply
with certain  technical  requirements  of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code")  applicable to real estate investment  trusts'  ("REIT's"),
the  Company's  property  management  and  development   activities,   sales  of
peripheral land and maintenance and security  operations are carried out through
CBL & Associates Management, Inc. (the "Management Company").

     On November 3, 1993, the Company completed the initial public offering (the
"Offering") of 15,400,000  shares of its common stock,  par value $.01 per share
(the "Common Stock").  Simultaneously  with the completion of the Offering,  CBL
transferred to the Operating Partnership substantially all of CBL's interests in
its real estate  properties  and its management  and  development  operations in
exchange  for an interest in the  Operating  Partnership.  CBL also  acquired an
additional interest in the Operating Partnership for a cash payment. Each of the
partnership  interests in the Operating  Partnership may, at the election of its
respective  holder,  be  exchanged  for shares of Common  Stock of the  Company,
subject to certain limitations imposed by the Code.

     The Offering  and the  application  of proceeds  therefrom,  including  the
Operating  Partnership's  acquisition  of certain  property  interests,  and the
contribution  by CBL of property  interests to the  Operating  Partnership,  are
referred to herein as the "Formation."

     In September 1995, the Company completed a follow-on  offering of 4,163,500
shares of its Common Stock at $20.625 per share. CBL purchased  150,000 of these
shares.

     In January 1997,  the Company  completed a follow-on  offering of 3,000,000
shares of its Common Stock at $26.125 per share.  CBL purchased  55,000 of these
shares.

     In June 1998, the Company  completed a public offering of 2,875,000  shares
of 9.0% Series A Cumulative  Redeemable Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred
Stock") at a price to the public of $25.00 per share.  The net  proceeds  of $70
million were used to repay variable rate indebtedness  incurred in the Company's
development and acquisition programs.

     On January 31, 2001, the Company issued 12,056,692  special common units of
the  Operating  Partnership  with a fair  value of $27.25 per unit for the first
stage of the  acquisition  of The Richard E.  Jacobs  Group,  Inc.'s  ("Jacobs")
interests in 21 malls and two associated centers.

     On January 31, 2001, the Company issued 603,344 special common units of the
Operating  Partnership  with a fair value of $27.25 per unit to purchase the 50%
interest in Madison Square Mall in  Huntsville,  Alabama that it did not already
own.  In June 2001 the  Company  issued  31,008  common  units of the  Operating
Partnership  with a value of $949,000 to  purchase  the 25%  interest in Madison
Plaza in Huntsville, Alabama that it did not already own.

     After  giving  effect to the above  transactions,  at December 31, 2001 CBL
holds a 17.7% limited partner interest in the Operating Partnership, the Company
indirectly  holds a 51.1% general and limited partner  interest in the Operating
Partnership,  Jacobs holds a 22.8%  limited  partner  interest and third parties
hold a 8.3% limited partner interest.  In addition,  CBL holds approximately 2.0
million of the outstanding shares of Common Stock for a total ownership share in
the Company of 21.8%.

General

     The Company  owns  interests  in a  portfolio  of  properties,  which as of
December 31, 2001  consisted of 52 enclosed  regional  malls (the  "Malls"),  18
associated  centers  (the  "Associated  Centers"),  each of  which  is part of a
regional  shopping mall complex,  and 68 independent  community and neighborhood
shopping centers (the "Community Centers").  Of these properties nineteen Malls,
thirteen  Associated Centers and sixty-four  Community Centers were developed by
CBL or the Company.

     As of December 31, 2001 the Company owned one regional  Mall,  and one mall
expansion under construction (the "Construction  Properties").  The Company also
owned as of  December  31,  2001  options to  acquire  certain  shopping  center
development sites (the "Development Properties").

     The  Company  also  owned,   as  of  December  31,  2001,   mortgages  (the
"Mortgages")  on eight  community  and  neighborhood  shopping  centers owned by
non-CBL  affiliates.  The Mortgages were granted in connection with sales by CBL
of  certain  properties  previously  developed  by CBL.  The  Company  also owns
interests  in  two  office   buildings  in   Chattanooga,   Tennessee   ("Office
Buildings").  The Company relocated its headquarters at year end to a new Office
Building  owned  by the  Company  and  opened  in  December,  2001.  The  Malls,
Associated  Centers,  Community Centers,  Construction  Properties,  Development
Properties,  Mortgages and Office Buildings are collectively  referred to herein
as the "Properties" and individually as a "Property".

     The Company and the Operating  Partnership generally own a 100% interest in
the  Properties.  With three  exceptions,  where the Company  and the  Operating
Partnership  own  less  than  a  100%  interest  in a  Property,  the  Operating
Partnership is the sole general  partner,  managing  general partner or managing
member of the partnership or limited  liability company which owns such Property
(each a  "Property  Partnership").  For two  Malls  and one  Associated  Center,
affiliates of the Operating Partnership are non-managing general partners in the
three Property Partnerships owning those Properties.

     For a full description of the Properties, see Item 2 -- "Properties."

     For information about the Company's reportable segments, see Note 17 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

     The Company's executive offices are currently located at CBL Center,  Suite
500, 2030 Hamilton Place Blvd., Chattanooga, Tennessee 37421-6000. The telephone
number at this address is (423) 855-0001.


Management and Operation of Properties

     Management Company

     The Company is self-managed and  self-administered.  To comply with certain
technical  requirements  of the Code,  the  Company's  property  management  and
development  activities and sales of peripheral land are carried out through the
Management Company.

                  CBL & Associates Poperties, Inc. - Form 10K

     The Operating  Partnership  holds 100% of the preferred stock and 5% of the
common stock of the Management Company. The remaining 95% of the common stock is
held by Charles  Lebovitz,  his family and his associates.  Substantially all of
CBL's  asset  management,   property  management  and  leasing  and  development
operations,   including  CBL's  executive,   property,   financial,   legal  and
administrative  personnel, were transferred to the Management Company as part of
the Formation.  The Management Company manages all of the Properties (except for
Governor's  Square and Governor's  Plaza in Clarksville,  Tennessee and Kentucky
Oaks Mall in Paducah,  Kentucky -- see below) under a management  agreement that
may be terminated at any time by the Operating  Partnership upon 30 days written
notice. In addition,  the Management Company manages certain properties owned by
CBL that were not transferred to the Company in the Formation as well as certain
shopping  centers  owned by non-CBL  affiliates.  Through its  ownership  of the
Management   Company's   preferred  stock,  the  Operating   Partnership  enjoys
substantially all of the economic benefits of the Management Company's business.
The  Management  Company's  Amended and Restated  Certificate  of  Incorporation
requires  that a majority of the  Management  Company's  board of  directors  be
independent  of  CBL.  Since  November  1993,  the  board  of  directors  of the
Management  Company has consisted of the same individuals as the Company's board
of directors,  including four independent  directors until January 31, 2001 when
two directors were added one of which is an independent director.

     On-Site Management

     The on-site  property  management  functions at the Malls include  leasing,
management,  data processing, rent collection,  project bookkeeping,  budgeting,
marketing, and promotions. Each Mall, for itself and its Associated Centers, has
an on-site  property  manager  who  oversees  the  on-site  staff and an on-site
marketing director who oversees the marketing program for that Mall. The on-site
Mall managers are experienced  managers with training in mall  management.  Each
Mall  manager and  marketing  director  reports to the home  office  through six
regional  Mall managers and six regional  marketing  directors.  These  regional
managers' offices are located in the Mall properties. District managers, most of
whom  are  located  at the  Company's  headquarters,  oversee  the  leasing  and
operations at a majority of the Community Centers.

     Virtually  all  operating  activities  of the  Company are  supported  by a
computer software system which is designed to provide  management with operating
data  necessary  to make  informed  business  decisions on a timely  basis.  The
Company has a program of on-going upgrades to hardware and software that support
the accounting and management  information systems. The Company also maintains a
web site to  publish  integrated  information  on the  world  wide web about the
Company and its  properties.  These systems were  developed to more  efficiently
assist  management  in  efforts to market the  Properties,  maintain  management
quality,  enhance  investor  relations  and  communications  and enhance  tenant
relations while minimizing  operating expenses.  Retail sales analysis,  leasing
information,  budget controls,  accounts  receivable/payable,  operating expense
variance  reports and income analysis are  continually  available to management.
via the  accounting and management  information  systems.  Through these systems
management also has available  information  that facilitates the development and
monitoring of budgets and other relevant information.

     Management pursues periodic  preventative  property  maintenance  programs,
which  encompass  paving,   roofing,   HVAC  and  general  improvements  to  the
Properties' common areas. The on-site property managers oversee all such work in
accordance  with approved  budgets with the  coordination  of, and reporting to,
both regional and home office management.


     Governor's Square and Kentucky Oaks

     Governor's  Square  and  Governor's  Plaza in  Clarksville,  Tennessee  and
Kentucky  Oaks in Paducah,  Kentucky are the only  Properties  in the  Company's
portfolio  in which the  Company is not the sole  general  partner  or  managing
general  partner or managing  member.  Governor's  Square is owned by a Property
Partnership,  the managing  general partner of which is a non-CBL  affiliate and
which owns a 47.5% interest in the Mall.  The Company is a non-managing  general
partner of  Governor's  Plaza.  The Company owns a 48% interest in Kentucky Oaks
Mall and has an option to acquire an additional  2% interest.  The Mall which is
managed by a non-CBL affiliate which owns a 50% interest.  Although the managing
general  partner  of  each  of  these   partnerships   controls  the  timing  of
distributions of cash flow, the Company's approval is required for certain major
decisions,  including  permanent  financing,  refinancing  and  sale  of  all or
substantially all of the partnership's  assets.  Property  management  services,
including accounting,  auditing,  maintenance,  promotional  programs,  leasing,
collection and insurance,  are performed by a property  manager  affiliated with
the non-CBL  managing general partner for which such property manager receives a
fee.

Employees

     The   Company,   through  the   Management   Company,   currently   employs
approximately  617 full time and 461 part time persons.  None of these employees
is currently  represented by any union.  The Company does not have any employees
other than its statutory officers.

Environmental Matters

     Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations,  a
current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs
of removal or remediation of petroleum and certain hazardous or toxic substances
on,  under or in such real estate.  Such laws  typically  impose such  liability

                                       5
<PAGE>
                  CBL & Associates Poperties, Inc. - Form 10K

without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for,
the presence of such  substances.  The costs of  remediation  or removal of such
substances  may be  substantial,  and the  presence of such  substances,  or the
failure to promptly remediate such substances,  may adversely affect the owner's
or  operator's  ability  to sell such real  estate or to borrow  using such real
estate as  collateral.  Persons  who arrange for the  disposal or  treatment  of
hazardous  or toxic  substances  may also be liable  for the costs of removal or
remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility, regardless
of whether such facility is owned or operated by such person.  Certain laws also
impose requirements on conditions and activities that may affect the environment
or the impact of the  environment  on human health.  Failure to comply with such
requirements  could result in the imposition of monetary  penalties (in addition
to the costs to achieve compliance) and potential  liabilities to third parties.
Among other  things,  certain laws  require  abatement or removal of friable and
certain  non-friable  asbestos-containing  materials  ("ACMs")  in the  event of
demolition or certain  renovations  or  remodeling.  Certain laws regarding ACMs
require  building  owners and lessees,  among other things,  to notify and train
certain  employees  working in areas known or presumed to contain ACMs.  Certain
laws also impose  liability  for release of ACMs into the air and third  parties
may seek  recovery  from owners or  operators  of real  properties  for personal
injury or property damage associated with ACMs. In connection with its ownership
and operation of the Properties,  the Company, the Operating  Partnership or the
relevant Property Partnership, as the case may be, may be potentially liable for
such costs or claims.

     All of the Properties (excluding properties upon which the Company holds an
option  to  purchase  but  does  not yet  own)  have  been  subject  to  Phase I
environmental   assessments  or  updates  of  existing  Phase  I   environmental
assessments by independent environmental consultants. Such assessments generally
consisted of a visual inspection of the Properties,  review of federal and state
environmental  databases and certain information  regarding historic uses of the
Property and adjacent areas and the preparation and issuance of written reports.
Some of the Properties contain, or contained, underground storage tanks ("UST"s)
used  for  storing  petroleum  products  or  wastes  typically  associated  with
automobile  service or other  operations  conducted at the  Properties.  Certain
Properties  contain,  or  contained,   dry-cleaning   establishments   utilizing
solvents.  Where  believed to be  warranted,  samples of building  materials  or
subsurface  investigations were, or will, be undertaken.  At certain Properties,
where warranted by the conditions,  the Company has developed and implemented an
operations and maintenance  program that establishes  operating  procedures with
respect to ACMs. The costs  associated with the  development and  implementation
for such programs were not material.

     Although there can be no assurances that such environmental  liability does
not exist, none of the environmental assessments have identified and the Company
is not aware of any  environmental  liability  with respect to the properties in
which the Company or the Operating Partnership has, or had, an interest (whether
as an owner or operator) that the Company believes would have a material adverse
effect on the  Company's  financial  condition,  results of  operations  or cash
flows. Nevertheless, it is possible that the environmental assessments available
to the  Company do not  reveal all  potential  environmental  liabilities,  that
subsequent  investigations  will identify material  contamination,  that adverse
environmental  conditions  have  arisen  subsequent  to the  performance  of the
environmental assessments,  or that there are material environmental liabilities
of which  management is unaware.  Moreover,  no assurances can be given that (i)
future  laws,   ordinances   or   regulations   will  not  impose  any  material
environmental  liability  or (ii) the  current  environmental  condition  of the
Properties  has not been or will not be affected by tenants and occupants of the
Properties,  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the Properties or
by third  parties  unrelated to the Company,  the Operating  Partnership  or the
relevant Property Partnership. The existence of any such environmental liability
could have an adverse effect on the Company's  results of operations,  cash flow
and the funds available to the Company to pay dividends.

     The  Company has not  recorded in its  financial  statements  any  material

General Risks of the Company's Business

     General Factors  Affecting  Investments in Shopping  Center  Properties and
Effect of Economic and Real Estate Conditions

     A shopping  center's  revenues  and value may be  adversely  affected  by a
number of factors, including: the national and regional economic climates; local
real estate  conditions (such as an oversupply of retail space);  perceptions by
retailers  or shoppers  of the safety,  convenience  and  attractiveness  of the
shopping center;  and the willingness and ability of the shopping center's owner
to provide  capable  management and  maintenance  services.  In addition,  other
factors may adversely  affect a shopping  center's  value without  affecting its
current revenues, including: changes in governmental regulations,  zoning or tax
laws;  potential  environmental  or other  legal  liabilities;  availability  of

                                       6

financing;  and changes in interest  rate levels.  There are  numerous  shopping
facilities  that compete with the  Properties in  attracting  retailers to lease
space. In addition,  retailers at the Properties face continued competition from
discount  shopping  centers,   outlet  malls,   wholesale  clubs,  direct  mail,
telemarketing,  television  shopping  networks and  shopping  via the  Internet.
Competition  could  adversely  affect the Operating  Partnership's  revenues and
funds  available  for  distribution  to partners,  which in turn will affect the
Company's revenues and funds available for distribution to stockholders.

     Geographic Concentration

     The Properties are located  principally in the  southeastern  United States
(Alabama,  Florida,  Georgia,  Kentucky,   Mississippi,  North  Carolina,  South
Carolina,  Tennessee and Virginia).  Thirty Malls,  fifteen Associated  Centers,
fifty Community Centers and the two Office Buildings are located in this region.
The Company's  results of operations  and funds  available for  distribution  to
stockholders  therefore will be subject generally to economic  conditions in the
southeastern  United States. The Properties  located in the southeastern  United
States accounted for 58.9% of the Company's total assets,  and provided 59.5% of
the Company's total revenues from all properties for the year ended December 31,
2001.

     Third Party Interests In Certain Properties

     The  Operating  Partnership  owns  partial  interests  in ten  Malls,  four
Associated Centers,  one Community Center, two Office Buildings,  one Mall under
development  and one Mall under  construction.  The Operating  Partnership or an
affiliate  of the  Company  is the  managing  general  partner  of the  Property
Partnerships  that own such Properties,  except for the Governor's  Square Mall,
Governor's Plaza and Kentucky Oaks Mall.

     Where the  Operating  Partnership  serves as  managing  general  partner of
Property  Partnerships,  it may have certain fiduciary  responsibilities  to the
other partners in those partnerships.  In certain cases, the approval or consent
of the other  partners is required  before the Operating  Partnership  may sell,
finance,  expand or make other  significant  changes in the  operations  of such
Properties. To the extent such approvals or consents are required, the Operating
Partnership may experience  difficulty in, or may be prevented from implementing
its plans with respect to  expansion,  development,  financing or other  similar
transactions with respect to such Properties.

     With respect to Governor's Square, Governor's Plaza and Kentucky Oaks Mall,
the  Operating  Partnership  does not have  day-to-day  operational  control  or
control  over  certain  major  decisions,  including  the  timing  and amount of
distributions,  which could result in decisions by the managing  general partner
that do not fully  reflect the  interests  of the Company,  including  decisions
relating  to the  standards  that the Company is required to satisfy in order to
maintain its status as a real estate investment trust for tax purposes. However,
decisions  relating to sales,  expansions,  dispositions of all or substantially
all of the assets,  and  financings  are subject to  approval by the  Operating
Partnership.

     Dependence on Significant Properties

     Eleven months of revenue at Hanes Mall in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and
the full years  revenue at  Coolsprings  Galleria in  Nashville,  Tennessee  and
Hamilton Place Mall in Chattanooga,  Tennessee accounted for approximately 3.9%,
3.6% and 3.6%,  respectively,  of total  revenues  of the Company for the period
ended  December  31,  2001.  The  Company's  financial  position  and results of
operations  will  therefore be somewhat  affected by the results  experienced at
these Properties.

     Dependence on Significant Markets

     In certain  markets the  Company  may have more than one Mall.  The top six
markets with one or more of the Company's Malls and various  Associated  Centers
and  Community  Centers  are:  three  Malls,  three  Associated  Centers and one
Community  Center in Nashville  Tennessee,  one Mall, four  Associated  Centers,
three Community Centers and two Office Buildings in Chattanooga,  Tennessee, one
Mall in Winston-Salem,  North Carolina, two Malls in Charleston,  South Carolina
and one Mall in  Minneapolis  (Burnsville),  Minnesota.  The Company's  share of
revenues derived from these markets  represent 10.1%,  4.6%, 3.9%, 3.5% and 3.4%
of the Company's  revenues for the year ended  December 31, 2001,  respectively.
Total revenue for eleven months of operations at two Malls in Madison, Wisconsin
represent  3.5% of total  revenues for all of the Company's  properties  for the
year ended December 31, 2001. The Company's share of revenues from the two Malls
in  Madison,  Wisconsin,  however  represent  only 2.0% of the  Company's  total
revenue for the Year ended December 31, 2001.. The Company's  financial position
and results of operations will therefore be affected by the results  experienced
at these Properties in these six markets.

     Dependence on Key Tenants

     As of December  31,  2001,  The Limited  Inc.  Stores  (including  Intimate
Brands,  Inc.) maintained 189 stores in the Company's properties and in the year
ended  December 31, 2001 accounted for  approximately  6.4% of total revenues of
the Company.  As of December 31, 2001, the Gap. Inc.. (The Gap, Old Navy, Banana
Republic  and Gap Kids ) had 67 stores and in the year ended  December 31, 2001,
accounted  for 2.7% of the total  revenues of the  Company.  As of December  31,
2001, the Footlocker,  Inc. (Footlocker,  Ladies Footlocker, Kids Footlocker and
Champs Sports) had 117 stores and in the year ended December 31, 2001, accounted
for 2.6% of the total  revenues of the Company.  The loss or bankruptcy of these
or any other  key  tenants  could  negatively  affect  the  Company's  financial
position and results of operations.


The Company's Strategy for Growth

     Management  believes  that per share  growth in the  Company's  Funds  from
Operations, as defined below, is one of the key factors in enhancing shareholder
value.  Management  also  believes  that Funds from  Operations is a widely used
measure of the operating performance of REITs, and its consistent  determination
provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. It is the objective of the
Company's  management  to achieve  growth in Funds from  Operations  through the
aggressive  management of the Company's existing  Properties,  the expansion and
renovation of existing Properties, the development of new properties, and select
acquisitions.  Funds from  Operations can also be affected by external  factors,
such as inflation, fluctuations in interest rates or changes in general economic
conditions, which are beyond the control of the Company's management.

     "Funds  from  Operations"  is defined by the  Company as net income  (loss)
before property depreciation,  other non-cash items, gains or losses on sales of
real estate assets and gains or losses on investments in marketable  securities.
Effective  January 1, 2000, the National  Association of Real Estate  Investment
Trusts ("NAREIT") clarified FFO to include all operating results - recurring and
non-recurring  - except those  results  defined as  "extraordinary  items" under
accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the  United  States.  Funds from
Operations does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by accounting
principals  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  ("GAAP")  and  is  not
necessarily  indicative of cash available from  operations to fund all cash flow
needs and should not be  considered as an  alternative  to net income (loss) for
purposes of evaluating the Company's operating  performance or as an alternative
to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

     The  Company   classifies  its  regional  malls  into  three  categories  -
stabilized  malls  ("Stabilized  Malls")  which  have  completed  their  initial
lease-up,  new malls ("New Malls") which are in their initial  lease-up phase or
are  being  redeveloped  and  newly  acquired  malls  ("Newly  Acquired  Malls")
representing the 21 mall portfolio acquired on January 31, 2001. At year end the
New Mall category was comprised of Springdale Mall in Mobile,  Alabama which was
acquired  in  September  1997  and  which is  currently  being  redeveloped  and
retenanted;  Parkway  Place Mall in  Huntsville,  Alabama  which was acquired in
December,  1998  and  which  is  being  redeveloped,   Arbor  Place  in  Atlanta
(Douglasville),  Georgia,  which  opened in  October  1999 and The Lakes Mall in
Muskegon, Michigan which opened in August 2001.

     Specifically,  the Company has  implemented  its  objective  of growing its
Funds from Operations and will continue to do so by:

-        Acquiring existing retail properties where cash flow can be enhanced by
         improved management, leasing, redevelopment and expansion.

                  Management believes that an opportunity for growth exists
                  through the acquisition of shopping centers that meet the
                  Company's investment criteria and targeted returns. In
                  general, the Company seeks to acquire well-located shopping
                  centers in middle-market geographic areas consistent with
                  management's experience where management believes significant
                  value can be created through its development, leasing and
                  management expertise.

                           On January 31, 2001, the Company acquired from The
                           Richard E. Jacobs Group interests in twenty-one Malls
                           and two Associated Centers, including the acquisition
                           of minority interests in certain properties, the
                           Newly Acquired Malls defined above. The total gross
                           leasable area of the twenty-three properties is 19.2
                           million square feet, or an average gross leasable
                           area of 914,000 square feet per Mall. The gross
                           leasable area of mall stores is approximately 5.9
                           million square feet. The Malls are located in middle
                           markets predominantly in the Southeast and the
                           Midwest. Certain information on the Properties that
                           wereacquired is as follows on the next page (as of
                           the acquisition date of January 31, 2001):

                  In addition to the Construction Properties as of February 28,
                  2002, the Company was pursuing the development of a number of
                  sites which the Company believes are viable for future
                  development as Malls, Associated Centers and Community Centers
                  Regional Mall development sites were being pursued in Georgia,
                  Mississippi and South Carolina, an Associated Center site was
                  being pursued in Texas and Community Center sites were being
                  pursued in Florida, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania
                  and Tennessee.

                  In general, the Company seeks out development opportunities in
                  middle-market trade areas that it believes are under-serviced
                  by existing retail facilities, have demonstrated improving
                  demographic trends or otherwise afford an opportunity for
                  effective market penetration and competitive presence.

Risks Associated with the Company's Growth Strategy

     In connection with the implementation of this growth strategy,  the Company
and the Operating  Partnership  will incur various risks including the risk that
development or expansion opportunities explored by the Company and the Operating
Partnership may be abandoned;  the risk that construction costs of a project may
exceed original estimates  possibly making the project not profitable;  the risk
that the  Company and the  Operating  Partnership  may not be able to  refinance
construction loans which are generally with full recourse to the Company and the
Operating  Partnership;  the risk that occupancy  rates and rents at a completed
project will not meet projections and will therefore be insufficient to make the
project  profitable;  and the need for  anchor,  mortgage  lender  and  property
partner  approvals  for  certain  expansion  activities.  In  the  event  of  an
unsuccessful  development project, the Company's and the Operating Partnership's
loss could exceed its investment in the project.

     The Company has in the past elected not to proceed with certain development
projects  and  anticipates  that it will do so  again  from  time to time in the
future. If the Company elects not to proceed with a development opportunity, the
development costs associated therewith ordinarily will be charged against income
and Funds From  Operations for the  then-current  period.  Any such charge could
have a material  adverse  effect on the Company's  results of operations for the
period in which the charge is taken.

Competition

     There are numerous shopping  facilities that compete with the Properties in
attracting  retailers  to lease  space.  The  Malls  are  generally  located  in
middle-markets.  Management  believes  that the Malls  have  strong  competitive
positions  because they generally are the only or largest  enclosed malls within
their  respective  trade areas.  In addition,  retailers at the Properties  face
continued  competition from discount shopping centers,  outlet malls,  wholesale
clubs, direct mail, telemarketing, television shopping networks and shopping via
the Internet.  Competition  could adversely  affect the Operating  Partnership's
revenues and funds available for  distributions to partners,  which in turn will
affect  the  Company's   revenues  and  funds  available  for   distribution  to
stockholders.

Seasonality

     The  Company's  business is somewhat  seasonal in nature with tenant  sales
achieving the highest  levels during the fourth  quarter  because of the holiday
season.  The Malls earn most of their  "temporary"  rents (rents from short-term
tenants)  during  the  holiday  period.   Thus,  occupancy  levels  and  revenue
production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year. Results
of  operations  realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results
likely to be experienced over the course of the entire year.

Qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust

     The Company has elected to be taxed as real estate  investment  trust under
the Code,  commencing  with its taxable year ended  December 31, 1993,  and will
seek to maintain such status.  As a qualified real estate  investment trust, the
Company  generally  will not be subject  to Federal  income tax to the extent it
distributes  at least 90% of its  current  year  real  estate  investment  trust
taxable  income to its  shareholders.  If the Company fails to qualify as a real
estate  investment  trust in any taxable  year,  the Company  will be subject to
Federal income tax (including  any  applicable  alternative  minimum tax) on its
taxable income at regular corporate rates.

Insurance

     The Operating Partnership carries comprehensive  liability,  fire, extended
coverage (including  coverage  for acts of terrorism) and rental loss  insurance
covering  all the  Properties,  with policy  specifications  and insured  limits
customarily  carried  for  similar  properties.  Management  believes  that  the
Properties are adequately insured in accordance with industry standards.


ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.

Malls

     Each of the  Malls is an  enclosed  regional  shopping  complex.  Each Mall
generally  has at least  three  Anchors  which  own or lease  their  stores  and
numerous  non-anchor  stores  with GLA  less  than  30,000  square  feet  ("Mall
Stores"),  most of which are  national  or  regional  retailers,  located  along
enclosed  malls  connecting  the  Anchors.  At  most  of the  Malls,  additional
freestanding  restaurants  and retail stores are located on the periphery of the
Mall complex. For the purposes of calculating sales per square foot,  non-Anchor
stores over 10,000  square feet are excluded but are  classified  as mall stores
for all other purposes.  The  freestanding  stores are, in most cases,  owned by
their  occupants.  Fifteen of the Mall complexes  include one or more Associated
Centers.

     The total GLA of the 52 Malls is approximately  41.5 million square feet or
an average GLA of approximately  778,000 square feet per Mall. Mall Store GLA is
14.7 million square feet including  leased  free-standing  buildings at December
31, 2001.  The Company  wholly owns all but ten of its Malls and manages all but
two of them.

     In the  years  ended  December  31,  1999,  2000 and  2001,  Mall  revenues
represented  approximately  76.9%,  77.3%  and  84.7%,  respectively,  of  total
revenues from the Company's Properties.

</TABLE>

     Occupancy  costs as a  percentage  of sales for  tenants in the  Stabilized
Malls (excluding malls acquired in 1999 from the 1999  calculation)  were 11.5%,
11.9%  and  11.3%  for the  years  ended  December  31,  1999,  2000,  and 2001,
respectively.

     The Malls are generally located in middle-markets. Management believes that
the Malls have strong competitive positions because they generally are the only,
or the dominant enclosed malls within their respective trade areas.  Trade areas
have  been  identified  by  management   based  upon  a  number  of  sources  of
information,   including  the  location  of  other  malls,   publicly  available
population information, customer surveys, surveys of customer automobile license
plates, as well as ZIP codes and third-party market studies.

     The three largest  revenue-producing Malls are Coolsprings Galleria,  Hanes
Mall and Hamilton Place Mall. Coolsprings Galleria is located on a 150-acre site
in Nashville,  Tennessee and  represented,  as of December 31, 2001, 2.1% of the
Properties'  total GLA, 2.3% of total Mall Store GLA and 3.6% of total  revenues
of the Company. Hanes Mall is located on a 112-acre site in Winston-Salem, North
Carolina and represented, as of December 31, 2001, 2.9% of the Properties' total
GLA,  3.4% of total Mall Store GLA and 3.9% of total  revenues  of the  Company.
Hamilton Place Mall is located in on a 187-acre site in  Chattanooga,  Tennessee
and  represented,  as of December 31, 2001, 2.2% of the  Properties'  total GLA,
2.2% of total Mall Store GLA and 3.6% of total revenues of the Company.

     Forty-three  of  the  fifty-two   Malls  have  undergone  an  expansion  or
renovation since their opening,  and all but six of the existing  Stabilized and
New Malls have either been built, renovated or expanded in the last 10 years one
of which,  Parkway  Place in  Huntsville,  Alabama  has been  demolished  and is
undergoing redevelopment.  During 2001, the Company completed the renovation and
first phase  expansion of Meridian  Mall in Lansing  Michigan,  completed a food
court  addition  at Georgia  Square  Mall in Athens  Georgia  and  completed  an
expansion of Springdale Mall in Mobile,  Alabama.  During 2001, the Company also
renovated  Burnsville Center in Minneapolis  (Burnsville),  Minnesota and two of
the Newly Acquired Malls;  Cary Towne Center in Cary, North Carolina and Fashion
Square in Saginaw,  Michigan. In 2002 the Company plans renovations for Columbia
Mall in Columbia, South Carolina;  Parkdale Mall in Beaumont,  Texas; Hanes Mall
in Winston-Salem,  North Carolina;  Kentucky Oaks Mall in Paducah,  Kentucky; St
Clair Square in Fairview  Heights,  Illinois;  Hickory Hollow Mall in Nashville,
Tennessee; and Stroud Mall in Stroudsburg,  Pennsylvania. Four of the Malls have
available  Anchor  pads  providing  expansion  potential.  Forty-eight  existing
Anchors  at  twenty-three  Malls have  aggregate  expansion  potential  at their
existing  stores of  approximately  1,532,000  buildable  square feet subject in
certain  cases to  maintaining  approved  parking  ratios and / or  approval  of
governmental  agencies. New  department  stores  opening in 2002 are as follows:
Target at Citadel Mall,  Charleston,  South  Carolina;  Belk at College  Square,
Morristown,  Tennessee;  Dillard's at Randolph Mall,  Asheboro,  North Carolina,
Foley's at Parkdale  Mall in Beaumont,  Texas and  Dillard's at Asheville  Mall,
Asheville,  North  Carolina.  All of these new  department  stores are replacing
previous anchors or anchor vacancies.

     The land  underlying the Malls is owned in fee simple in all cases,  except
for Walnut Square,  WestGate Mall, St. Clair Square, Bonita Lakes Mall, Meridian
Mall,  Stroud Mall,  Wausau  Center and Eastgate  Mall which are each subject to
long-term ground leases for all or a portion of the land underlying these Malls.

     Anchors.  Anchors  are a critical  factor in a Mall's  success  because the
public's  identification with a property typically focuses on its Anchors.  Mall
Anchors  generally are department  stores whose  merchandise  appeals to a broad
range of  shoppers.  Although  the Malls  derive a smaller  percentage  of their
operating  income from Anchor stores than from Mall Stores,  strong Anchors play
an important part in generating  customer traffic and making the Malls desirable
locations for Mall Store tenants.

     Anchors  either  own  their  stores  together  with  the land  under  them,
sometimes  with adjacent  parking  areas,  or enter into  long-term  leases with
respect to their  stores at rental rates that are  significantly  lower than the
rents charged to tenants of Mall Stores.  Anchors account for approximately 6.4%
of the total revenues from the Company's Properties.  Each Anchor which owns its
own store has entered  into a  reciprocal  easement  agreement  with the Company
covering,  among  other  things,  operating  covenants,   reciprocal  easements,
property operations, initial construction and future expansions.

     The Malls at  December  31, 2001 have a total of 226 Anchors and one vacant
Anchor  storesat  each of the following  Malls:  Asheville  Mall,  Citadel Mall,
College Square Mall,  Parkdale Mall and Randolph Mall. New department stores are
scheduled to open in 2002 eliminating these vacant anchor stores. One new Anchor
vacancy  occurred  after  December 31, 2001 at Kentucky Oaks Mall. The following
table  indicates all Mall Anchors and sets forth the aggregate  number of square
feet owned or leased by Anchors in the Malls as of December 31, 2001.

     Cost of  Occupancy.  Management  believes  that in  order to  maximize  the
Company's Funds from Operations,  tenants in Mall Stores must be able to operate
profitably.  A major factor contributing to tenant profitability is the tenant's
cost of occupancy.

     The following table  summarizes for Stabilized Mall and Newly Acquired Mall
Store  tenants the  occupancy  costs under their leases as a percentage of total
Mall Store sales for the last three years.

Associated Centers

     The  eighteen  Associated  Centers  are  each  part of a Mall  complex  and
generally have one or two Anchor  tenants and various  smaller  tenants.  Anchor
tenants in these centers include such retailers as Books-A-Million, Target, Toys
"R" Us, TJ Maxx, and Goody's, which are category dominant retailers that benefit
from the regional draw of the Malls.  The  Associated  Centers also increase the
draw to the total Mall complex.

     Total leasable GLA of the eighteen  Associated Centers is approximately 3.2
million square feet,  including Anchors, or an average of approximately  178,000
square feet per center.  As of December 31, 2001, 95.6% of total leasable GLA at
the  Associated  Centers was  occupied.  During 2001 the Company  completed  the
expansion of one Associated Center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

     In the years ended  December 31, 1999,  2000,  and 2001,  revenues from the
Associated Centers represented  approximately 3.7%, 4.1 and 2.6%,  respectively,
of total revenues from the Company's Properties.

     In the years ended December 31, 1999,  2000 and 2001,  average tenant sales
per square foot at the  Associated  Centers were  approximately  $184,  $185 and
$198, respectively.

     Average base rent per square foot at the Associated  Centers decreased from
$9.88 at December 31, 2000 to $9.73 at December 31, 2001.

Community and Power Centers

     In addition to Mall development, the Company's development activities focus
on  Community  Centers,   and  power  centers.   Community  Centers  pose  fewer
development  risks than Malls because they have shorter  development  timetables
and lower  up-front  costs.  Community  Centers  also  afford  the  Company  the
opportunity  to meet the needs of  retailers  for whom a  "convenience"  type of
location is more appropriate and the needs of customers whose trade areas cannot
support a regional mall. Power centers are larger than other Community  Centers,
with several large anchor  stores which draw  shoppers  from a wider  geographic
area.

     The Company's  Community  Center  developments in the 1980's were generally
anchored by  supermarkets,  and, in certain cases, by drug stores.  Management's
current  focus has  expanded  to  include  the  development  of larger  centers,
anchored by mass  merchandisers  and  department  stores,  while  continuing the
development of smaller centers anchored by supermarkets and drug stores.  During
2001, the Company opened the 404,000  Creekwood  Crossing in Bradenton,  Florida
and completed expansions at Coastal Way in Springhill, Florida; Massard Crossing
in Ft. Smith, Arkansas;  Sutton Plaza in Mt. Olive, New Jersey; and Chesterfield
Crossing in  Richmond,  Virginia.  During 2001,  the Company sold six  Community
Centers for total proceeds of $78.2 million. The proceeds were used primarily to
retire debt. The Company also sold one Community Center in January 2001.

     Community  Centers,  other than power  centers,  range in size from  25,000
square feet to in excess of 420,000  square feet.  Anchors in Community  Centers
generally  lease  their  store space and occupy  60-85% of a center's  GLA.  The
number of stores in a  Community  Center  ranges from one to  seventeen  with an
average of nine stores per center.

     The Company's two power  centers,  which were  completed and opened in 1997
and 1998,  average  786,000 square feet and have an average of nine major anchor
stores and  additional  small shop space  ranging  from  38,000  square  feet to
136,000  square feet.  These power centers are included in the Community  Center
classification in this report.

     Total GLA of the 68 Community  Centers is approximately  8.5 million square
feet, or an average of approximately  125,000 square feet per center.  Excluding
power centers the average is 105,000 square feet per center.  As of December 31,
2001, 97.0% of total leasable GLA at the Community Centers was leased.

     In the years ended  December 31,  1999,  2000 and 2001,  revenues  from the
Community Centers represented approximately 17.8%, 17.5 and 11.7%, respectively,
of total revenues from the Company's Properties.

     Occupancy at the  Community  Centers  decreased  from 97.8% at December 31,
2000 to 97.0% at December 31, 2001.

     Average base rent per square foot at the Community  Centers  increased from
$8.85 at December 31, 2000, to $9.43 at December 31, 2001.

     As of December 31, 2001, Food Lion, a major regional  supermarket  operator
with  headquarters  in North  Carolina  served as an anchor  tenant in 25 of the
Company's  Community  Centers.  For the year ended December 31, 2001,  Food Lion
accounted  for  approximately  1.1% of the revenues  generated by the  Company's
Properties.

     With the exception of Suburban  Plaza,  Lions Head Village,  MarketPlace at
Flower Mound and Willowbrook Plaza , which were acquired by the Company in March
1995,  July  1998,  March  2000 and  February  2001,  respectively,  each of the
Community Centers was developed by the Company.

Mortgages

     The Company owns six Mortgages which were granted prior to the Offering and
two granted  since in connection  with sales by CBL of  properties  which it had
previously developed.

     The Company holds fee mortgages on eight community centers, which mortgages
had, as of December 31, 2001, an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $8.1
million. Such mortgages entitle the Company to receive substantially all of such
properties' current cash flow in the form of periodic debt service payments. The
encumbered  properties  all  opened  between  1981 and 1990 and have two  Anchor
vacancies.

     In the years ended  December 31, 1999,  2000,  and 2001,  revenues from the
Mortgages  represented  less  than  0.5% of total  revenues  from the  Company's
Properties.

Mortgage Debt and Ratio to Total Market Capitalization

     As of December 31, 2001, the Operating Partnership's proportionate share of
indebtedness  of all  Properties  (whether  or not  consolidated  for  financial
statement  reporting  purposes,   including  the  Construction  Properties)  was
approximately  $2.393 billion.  The Company's total market  capitalization  (the
aggregate  market  value of the  Company's  outstanding  shares  of  Common  and
Preferred Stock, assuming the full exchange of the limited partnership interests
in the Operating  Partnership  for Common Stock,  plus the $2.393  billion total
debt of the Operating  Partnership)  as of December 31, 2001 was $4.04  billion.
Accordingly,  the  Company's  debt to total  market  capitalization  ratio as of
December  31, 2001 was 59.2%.  The debt to total  market  capitalization  ratio,
which is based  upon  the  Company's  proportionate  share of  consolidated  and
unconsolidated   indebtedness   and  market  values  of  equity,   differs  from
debt-to-book   capitalization   ratios,   which  are  based  upon   consolidated
indebtedness and book values.

     The following table sets forth certain information  regarding the mortgages
and secured lines of credit encumbering the Properties.

         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

     The  following  discussion  and  analysis of the  financial  condition  and
results  of  operations  should  be read in  conjunction  with CBL &  Associates
Properties, Inc. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.

     Information included herein may contain "forward-looking statements" within

actual results,  financial and otherwise,  may differ materially from the events
and results discussed in the  forward-looking  statements.  We direct you to the
Company's  other  filings  with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  and

GENERAL BACKGROUND

     On November 3, 1993,  CBL & Associates  Properties,  Inc.  (the  "Company")
completed an initial public offering of 15,400,000 shares of common stock priced
at $19.50 per share (the "Offerings").  In connection with the Offerings,  CBL &
Associates, Inc. and its affiliates contributed their interests in properties to
CBL & Associates Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership").  The Company
is the 100% owner of two qualified REIT  subsidiaries,  CBL Holdings I, Inc. and
CBL Holdings II, Inc.,  which are the sole general  partner and majority  owner,
respectively,  of the Operating  Partnership.  As a result, the CBL & Associates
Properties, Inc. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto reflect the
consolidated financial results of the Operating  Partnership,  which includes at
December 31, 2001, the operations of a portfolio of properties  consisting of 45
regional malls, 16 associated centers,  two power centers, 66 community centers,
two office buildings,  joint venture investments in seven regional malls and two
associated  centers,  and income  from eight  mortgages  (the"Properties").  The
Operating  Partnership  currently has under  construction  one mall and one mall
expansion,  and owns  options to acquire  certain  shopping  center  development
sites. The consolidated  financial  statements also include the results of CBL &
Associates Management,  Inc. (the "Management Company").

     The  Company   classifies  its  regional  malls  into  three  categories  -
stabilized  malls which have completed their initial  lease-up;  new malls which
are in their initial lease-up phase;  and newly acquired malls  representing the
21 mall  portfolio  acquired  on January  31,  2001.  The new mall  category  is
presently comprised of Springdale Mall in Mobile, Alabama, which was acquired in
September  1997  and is  being  redeveloped  and  retenanted;  Parkway  Place in
Huntsville,  Alabama, which was acquired in December 1998 and is currently being
redeveloped;  Arbor Place Mall in Atlanta (Douglasville),  Georgia, which opened
in October 1999 and The Lakes Mall in Muskegon,  Michigan which opened in August
2001.

     On  January  31,  2001,  the  Company  completed  the  first  stage  of the
acquisition  of The  Richard E.  Jacobs  Group's  interests  in 21 malls and two
associated  centers for total  consideration  of  approximately  $1.26  billion,
including  the  acquisition  of minority  interests in certain  properties.  The
purchase price is comprised of $124.5 million in cash,  including  closing costs
of  approximately  $12 million;  the  assumption of $745.5  million in primarily
non-recourse  mortgage debt; and the issuance of 12,056,692 special common units
of the Operating  Partnership  a value of $27.25 per unit.  The cash portion was
funded  from  a  new  $212  million  unsecured  credit  facility  provided  by a
consortium  of banks led by Wells  Fargo.  The Company  will close on the second
stage in 2002,  which will consist of cash of $0.3  million,  the  assumption of
$25.7 million in non-recourse mortgage debt, and the issuance of 499,733 special
common  units of the  Operating  Partnership.  In the second  stage  closing the
Company will acquire additional  interests in properties accounted for under the
equity method of accounting.  In a separate  transaction,  the Company issued an
additional 603,344 special common units of the Operating Partnership to purchase
the remaining 50% interest in Madison Square Mall in Huntsville, Alabama that it
did not already own. In June 2001 the Company  issued 31,008 common units of the
Operating  Partnership  to  purchase  the  25%  interest  in  Madison  Plaza  in
Huntsville, Alabama that it did not already own.

                     Condition and Results of Operations

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Sales

     Mall shop sales, for those tenants who have reported,  in the 48 stabilized
malls in the Company's  portfolio,  decreased by 1.5% on a comparable per square
foot basis as shown below:

     Total sales volume in the mall  portfolio,  including new malls,  decreased
0.5% to $2.901 billion in 2001 from $2.915 billion in 2000.

     Occupancy  costs as a percentage of sales for the years ended  December 31,
2001,  2000 and 1999, for the stabilized  malls  (excluding the mall acquired in
1999 from that year) were 11.3%, 11.9% and 11.5%, respectively.

</TABLE>

     In 2001 and 2000,  revenues  from the Malls  represented  84.7% and  77.3%,
respectively, of total revenues from consolidated and unconsolidated properties;
revenues  from  Associated  Centers  represented  2.6% and  4.1%,  respectively;
revenues from Community Centers represented 11.7% and 17.5%,  respectively;  and
revenues  from  Mortgages  and the Office  Building  represented  1.0% and 1.1%,
respectively.    Accordingly,   revenues   and   results   of   operations   are
disproportionately impacted by the malls' achievements.

     The  shopping  center  business is somewhat  seasonal in nature with tenant
sales  achieving  the highest  levels during the fourth  quarter  because of the
holiday  season.  The malls earn most of their  "temporary"  rents  (rents  from
short-term  tenants)  during the  holiday  period.  Thus,  occupancy  levels and
revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year.
Results of  operations  realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the
results likely to be experienced over the course of the entire year.

COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2001 TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FOR 2000

     Total revenues in 2001  increased by $187.9  million,  or 52.7%,  to $544.4
million  compared with $356.5 million in 2000. Of this  increase,  minimum rents
increased by $126.8 million,  or 56.3%,  to $352.3 million  compared with $225.5
million in 2000;  percentage rents increased by $0.9 million,  or 10.4%, to $9.7
million  compared  with $8.8  million in 2000;  other  rents  increased  by $4.4
million,  or 69.9%,  to $10.6 million  compared  with $6.2 million in 2000;  and
tenant  reimbursements  increased by $55.1 million,  or 51.6%, to $161.8 million
compared with $106.8 million in 2000.

     Approximately  $161.5  million of the  increase in revenues  resulted  from
operations at the eighteen new centers,  which were acquired on January 31, 2001
from The Richard E. Jacobs Group and are included in the consolidated  financial
statements.  These  properties  are  those  properties  with  a 50%  or  greater
ownership  by  the  Company  described  in  the  Development,   Expansions,  and
Acquisitions section of this report:

     Approximately  $25.6  million of the  increase  in revenues  resulted  from
operations  at the  eight  new  centers  opened  or  acquired  during  the  past
twenty-four  months  offset by a  decrease  in  revenues  of $5.5  million  from
nineteen  centers  sold in the last  twenty-four  months.  The eight new centers
consist of:

                Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
                     Condition and Results of Operations

     Improved  occupancies,  improved  operations  and  increased  rents  in the
Company's  operating  portfolio  generated  approximately  $3.0  million  of the
increased  revenues.  Revenues  from the  early  termination  of  tenant  leases
increased by $3.3 million to $4.1 million in 2001  compared with $0.7 million in
2002.

     Management, development and leasing fees increased in 2001 by $1.0 million,
or 23.4%, to $5.2 million compared with $4.2 million in 2000. Interest and other
income decreased in 2001 by $0.3 million, or 5.5%, to $4.8 million compared with
$5.1  million in 2000.  This  decrease  resulted  primarily  from a decrease  in
interest  income  during 2001 from  interest  income  received on proceeds  from
community center sales held in escrow in 2000.

     Property  operating  expenses,  including real estate taxes and maintenance
and repairs,  increased in 2001 by $66.5  million,  or 62.2%,  to $173.4 million
compared with $106.9  million in 2000.  This increase is primarily the result of
the twenty-six new centers opened or acquired over the past twenty-four  months.
The  Company's  cost  recovery  ratio,  not  including  bad debt expense of $5.9
million  was  96.6% in 2001  compared  with  99.9% in 2000 due to  decreases  in
occupancy and the bankruptcy of tenants who have been temporarily  replaced with
tenants whose recovery clauses are more restrictive.

     Depreciation and amortization increased in 2001 by $27.0 million, or 44.5%,
to $87.6 million  compared with $60.6  million in 2000.  This increase  resulted
primarily  from  depreciation  and  amortization  on the  twenty-six new centers
opened or acquired over the past  twenty-four  months and the Company's  capital
investment in operating properties.

     Interest  expense  increased in 2001 by $59.9 million,  or 63.3%, to $154.4
million  compared with $94.6 million in 2000.  This increase is primarily due to
increased interest expense on the twenty-six new centers opened or acquired over
the past  twenty-four  months offset by  reductions in interest  expense on debt
retired with the proceeds from the sales of properties.

     General and administrative  expenses increased in 2001 by $1.0 million,  or
5.9%,  to $18.8 million  compared with $17.8 million in 2000.  This increase was
due to  increases  in  general  overhead  to manage 21 malls and two  associated
centers  that were  acquired  in January  2001.  The amount of the  increase  in
general and administrative  expense is offset by a $1.0 million reduction in the
reserve for state taxes.

     Gain on sales of real estate assets was $10.6 million in 2001 compared with
$16.0  million in 2000.  The  majority  of the gain on sales in 2001 is from the
$8.4 million gain on six community  centers sold in 2001. The centers sold were:
Jean Ribaut Square in Beaufort,  South  Carolina;  Bennington  Place in Roanoke,
Virginia;  Sand Lake  Corners in Orlando,  Florida;  Park  Village in  Lakeland,
Florida;  Sutton  Plaza in Mt.  Olive,  New Jersey  and  Creekwood  Crossing  in
Bradenton,  Florida.  Additional  gains were generated by outparcel sales at The
Lakes Mall in Muskegon, Michigan which opened on August 15, 2001.

     Equity in earnings of unconsolidated  affiliates  increased in 2001 by $3.5
million to $7.2 million  compared  with $3.7 million in 2000.  This increase was
the  result  of  acquiring  a  non-controlling  interest  in four  malls and one
associated  center in three  partnerships,  all  accounted  for under the equity
method of accounting.  The increase was offset by decreases as the result of the
end of operations at Parkway Place Mall in Huntsville,  Alabama,  which is being
redeveloped,  and by the acquisition of the remaining interest in Madison Square
Mall in Huntsville,  Alabama. Since the Company now owns 100% of the interest in
the Madison  Square Mall,  this property is now accounted for as a  consolidated
property  rather than under the equity  method.  The new centers  accounted  for
under the equity method are:  Columbia Mall in Columbia,  South  Carolina;  East

COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2000 TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FOR 1999

     Total  revenues in 2000  increased by $38.9  million,  or 12.2%,  to $356.5
million  compared with $317.6 million in 1999. Of this  increase,  minimum rents
increased by $22.4 million,  or 11.1%,  to $225.5  million  compared with $203.0
million in 1999;  percentage rents increased by $1.4 million,  or 19.1%, to $8.8
million  compared  with $7.4  million in 1999;  other  rents  increased  by $0.8
million,  or 14.8%,  to $6.2 million  compared  with $5.4  million in 1999;  and
tenant  reimbursements  increased by $17.0 million,  or 18.9%, to $106.8 million
compared with $89.8 million in 1999.

     Approximately  $22.3 million of the increase in revenues  resulted from the
ten new centers  opened or acquired  during 1999 and 2000. The centers opened or
acquired  in 1999 and  contributing  to 2000  increases  are Arbor Place Mall in
Atlanta  (Douglasville),   Georgia;  The  Landing  at  Arbor  Place  in  Atlanta
(Douglasville),  Georgia; York Galleria in York, Pennsylvania; Sand Lake Corners
in Orlando,  Florida; and Fiddler's Run in Morganton,  North Carolina, which was
sold in 2000. The five new centers opened or acquired in 2000 are Marketplace at
Flower  Mound in Dallas  (Flower  Mound),  Texas;  Coastal  Way in Spring  Hill,
Florida;  Chesterfield  Crossing  in  Richmond,  Virginia;  Gunbarrel  Pointe in
Chattanooga,  Tennessee;  and Sutton Plaza  Expansion  in Mt Olive,  New Jersey.

                Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
                     Condition and Results of Operations

Improved  occupancies  and  operations  and  increased  rents  in the  Company's
operating  portfolio  generated  approximately  $21.8  million of the  increased
revenues,  with the largest  increases derived from Rivergate Mall in Nashville,
Tennessee,  and Meridian Mall in Lansing,  Michigan. These increases were offset
by a decrease in revenues of $2.2 million from 13 community centers sold in 2000
and a decrease of $3.1 million in management and development  fees relating to a
one-time fee earned in the Company's co-development program in 1999.

     Management, development and leasing fees decreased in 2000 by $3.6 million,
or 46.7%,  to $4.2  million  compared  with $7.8  million  in 1999.  Most of the
decrease was due to a one-time fee of $3.1 million earned in the  co-development
program  in 1999.  The  balance  of the  decrease  was due to the  reduction  in
continuing  co-development  fees. Interest and other income increased in 2000 by
$0.9 million, or 21.4%, to $5.1 million compared with $4.2 million in 1999. This
increase  resulted  primarily  from other  income at the two malls  acquired and
opened over the past twenty-four months and interest income on the proceeds from
community center sales held in escrow during the year.

     Property  operating  expenses,  including real estate taxes and maintenance
and repairs,  increased in 2000 by $10.7  million,  or 11.1%,  to $106.9 million
compared  with $96.2  million in 1999.  This increase is primarily the result of
the ten new centers  opened or acquired over the past  twenty-four  months.  The
Company's  cost recovery  ratio,  which  includes  redistribution  of utilities,
increased  to 99.9% in 2000  compared  with  93.3% in 1999 due to  increases  in
occupancy which occurred at the end of 1999 and continued  through calendar year
2000.

     Depreciation and amortization  increased in 2000 by $7.1 million, or 13.2%,
to $60.6 million  compared with $53.5  million in 1999.  This increase  resulted
primarily from  depreciation  and  amortization on the ten new centers opened or
acquired over the past twenty-four  months and the Company's capital  investment
in operating properties.

     Interest  expense  increased in 2000 by $12.1 million,  or 14.7%,  to $94.6
million  compared with $82.5 million in 1999.  This increase is primarily due to
increased  interest  expense on the ten new centers  opened or acquired over the
past twenty-four months offset by reductions in interest expense on debt retired
with the proceeds from the sales of properties.

     General and administrative  expenses increased in 2000 by $1.6 million,  or
9.6%,  to $17.8  million  compared with $16.2 million in 1999. A portion of this
increase  was due to  increases  in general  overhead in  preparation  to assume
management  of The  Richard  E.  Jacobs  Group's  interests  in 21 malls and two
associated centers that were subsequently acquired in January 2001.

     Gain on sales of real estate assets was $16.0 million in 2000 compared with
$8.4 million in 1999. The majority of the gain in 2000 is from the $10.5 million
gain on 13  community  centers sold in 2000.  The centers sold were:  Centerview
Plaza in China Grove,  North Carolina;  Clark's Pond in South  Portland,  Maine;
Dorchester Crossing in Charleston,  South Carolina;  Fiddler's Run in Morganton,
North Carolina; Genesis Square in Crossville,  Tennessee;  Hollins Plantation in
Roanoke,  Virginia; Karns Korner in Knoxville,  Tennessee;  Lakeshore Station in
Gainsville,  Georgia;  Sparta  Crossing  in Sparta,  Tennessee;  Sterling  Creek
Commons in Portsmouth,  Virginia; Tyler Square in Radford, Virginia;  University
Crossing in Pueblo, Colorado; and Wildwood Plaza in Salem, Virginia.  Additional
gains were generated by outparcel and pad sales at two centers under development
in 2000,  Creekwood  Crossing  in  Bradenton,  Florida,  and The  Lakes  Mall in
Muskegon,  Michigan, as well as outparcel sales at Sand Lake Corners in Orlando,
Florida, which opened in 1999.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     The principal  uses of the Company's  liquidity and capital  resources have
historically  been  for  property  development,   acquisitions,   expansion  and
renovation programs, and debt repayment. To maintain its qualification as a real
estate  investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code, the Company  currently
is required to distribute to its  shareholders  at least 90% of its "Real Estate
Investment  Trust  Taxable  Income" as defined in the  Internal  Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code").

     As of  December  31,  2001,  the  Company had $47.6  million  available  in
unfunded  construction loans to be used for completion of construction  projects
and   replenishment  of  working  capital   previously  used  for  construction.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2001, the Company had obtained revolving credit
lines and term loans  totaling  $389.4  million,  of which  $171.8  million  was

available. Also, as a publicly traded company, the Company has access to capital
through both the public equity and debt  markets.  The Company has filed a shelf
registration  statement  authorizing  shares  of  the  Company's  common  stock,
preferred  stock,  and warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock
with an aggregate public offering price of up to $350 million, with $278 million
available as of December 31, 2001. The Company  anticipates that the combination
of these sources will, for the foreseeable future, provide adequate liquidity to
enable it to continue its capital programs substantially as in the past and make
distributions  to its  shareholders in accordance  with the Code's  requirements
applicable to real estate investment trusts.

     Management  expects to refinance the majority of the mortgage notes payable
maturing over the next five years with replacement loans.

     The Company's  capital  structure at December 31, 2001,  includes  property
specific mortgages, which are generally non-recourse, revolving lines of credit,
common  stock,  preferred  stock,  and a  minority  interest  in  the  Operating
Partnership.  The minority interest in the Operating Partnership  represents the
17.7%  ownership  interest in the Operating  Partnership  held by certain of the
Company's executive and senior officers which may be exchanged for approximately
8.9 million  shares of common stock.  Additionally,  these  executive and senior
officers and the Company's directors own approximately 2.0 million shares of the
outstanding  common stock of the Company,  for a combined  total interest in the
Operating  Partnership on December 31, 2001 of  approximately  21.8%.  Ownership
interests  issued to fund  acquisitions  in January 2001 may be exchanged  after
January  2004 for  approximately  12.6  million  shares  of common  stock  which
represent a 25.3%  interest in the Operating  Partnership.  Ownership  interests
issued to fund  acquisitions  in other years and interests of former  executives
may be  exchanged  for  approximately  2.9 million  shares of common stock which
represent a 5.9% interest in the Operating Partnership. Assuming the exchange of
all limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership for common stock,
there would be  approximately  50.1 million  shares of common stock  outstanding
with a market value of approximately  $1.579 billion at December 31, 2001 (based
on the  closing  price of the  Company's  common  stock of  $31.50  per share on
December 31,  2001).  The  Company's  total market  equity is $1.652  billion at
December 31, 2001, including 2.9 million shares of preferred stock (based on the
closing price of its preferred  stock of $25.20 per share on December 31, 2001).
The Company's current executive and senior officers'  ownership  interests had a
market value of approximately $343.8 million at December 31, 2001.

     Mortgage debt consists of debt on certain  consolidated  properties as well
as debt on eight properties in which the Company owns non-controlling interests,
accounted for under the equity method of  accounting.  At December 31, 2001, the
Company's share of funded mortgage debt on its consolidated properties (adjusted
for minority  investors'  interests in eight  properties) was $1.439 billion and
its pro rata share of mortgage debt on unconsolidated  properties (accounted for
under the equity method) was $70.0 million for total fixed-rate debt obligations
of $1.509 billion with a  weighted-average  interest rate of 7.5%.  Consolidated
and  unconsolidated  variable-rate  debt  accounted  for $883.9  million  with a
weighted-average  interest  rate of 4.2%.  Total debt  obligations  amounted  to
$2.393  billion.  Variable-rate  debt accounted for  approximately  36.9% of the
Company's  total  debt  and  21.9%  of its  total  capitalization.  Through  the
execution of interest rate swap  agreements,  the Company has fixed the interest
rates on $220.0 million of  variable-rate  debt at a  weighted-average  interest
rate of 6.4%. Of the Company's  remaining  variable-rate debt of $663.9 million,
$67.0 million of debt is subject to variable  rates on  construction  properties
and $596.6 million of debt is subject to variable rates on operating properties.
There were no fees charged to the Company related to these swap agreements.  The
Company's  interest rate swap  agreements in place at December 31, 2001,  are as

                Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
                     Condition and Results of Operations

     At  January  1,  2001,  the  Company  implemented  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards ("SFAS") No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and  Hedging  Activities",  as  amended,  ("SFAS  No.  133")  which  establishes
accounting and reporting  standards  requiring that every derivative  instrument
(including  certain  derivative  instruments  embedded  in other  contracts)  be
recorded in the balance  sheet as either an asset or  liability  measured at its
fair value. At January 1, 2001 the Company determined that with the exception of
two swap  agreements that expired during the first quarter of 2001 the Company's
derivative  instruments were effective and qualified for hedge  accounting.  The
Company also determined that new swap agreements obtained in 2001 were effective
and qualified for hedge  accounting.  The Company measured the  effectiveness of
these  instruments  in place during each quarter in the year ended  December 31,
2001 and determined  that the swap agreements  continued to be highly  effective
and continued to qualify for hedge  accounting.  The effective  swap  agreements
were  recorded on the  consolidated  balance  sheet at their fair values of $6.8
million in accrued liabilities and in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Over
time, the unrealized  gains and losses held in accumulated  other  comprehensive
loss will be reclassified  to earnings as interest  expense as swap payments are
made to the swap  counterparties.  This  reclassification is consistent with the
timing of when hedged items are  recognized in earnings.  Within the next twelve
months,  the Company  expects to reclassify  to earnings as interest  expense an
estimated  $5.2  million  of the  current  balance  held  in  accumulated  other
comprehensive loss.

     The  outstanding   balance  of  $216.3  million  on  the  Company's  credit
facilities  had a  weighted-average  interest rate of 3.2% (before  applied swap
agreements)  at  December  31,  2001.  Each of the credit  facilities  includes
covenants  that  require  the  Company to  maintain  minimum  net worth  levels,
maintain  interest and debt  coverage  ratios,  maintain  total  obligations  to
capitalized value ratios,  and maintain  limitations on variable-rate  debt. The
credit facilities also require that the Company's senior management  continue to
consist  of certain  individuals  and to  maintain  certain  levels of  minority
ownership in the Operating Partnership. The First Tennessee Bank credit facility
provides that if the Company  completes an offering of its securities,  not less
than  75% of the net  proceeds  of any such  offering  will be  applied  for the
benefit of the Operating Partnership.

     The following table sets forth the Company's credit  facilities at December
31, 2001 (in millions):

     During 2001 the Company closed fixed rate permanent and variable rate loans
totaling  $544.7  million  at a  weighted-average  interest  rate  of 4.8% as of
December 31, 2001.  The details of the fixed rate permanent  loans are:  Fayette
Mall in Lexington,  Kentucky with a $98 million loan at 7.0%, Brookfield Mall in
Milwaukee  (Brookfield),  Wisconsin with a loan addition of $30 million at 6.87%
and Asheville Mall in Asheville,  North Carolina with a loan of $71.2 million at
6.98%.  The  details of the  variable  rate loans are:  Midland  Mall in Midland
Michigan,  Parkdale  Mall in Beaumont,  Texas,  Fashion  Square Mall in Saginaw,
Michigan,  Jefferson  Mall in Louisville,  Kentucky,  Columbia Mall in Columbia,
South Carolina and Northwoods  Mall in North  Charleston,  South Carolina all of
which were refinanced with separate  variable rate loans totaling $314.1 million
for terms of up to three years.  The Regency Mall in Racine,  Wisconsin  loan of
$28.6 million was refinanced with proceeds from the Company's credit  facilities
The  proceeds of these loans were used to prepay and retire  fixed rate loans of
$362.7 million, repay variable-rate  indebtedness on loans and credit facilities
of $165.5,  fund  prepayment  penalties  of $13.0  million  and to fund fees and
accrued interest of $4.0 million.

     On January 31, 2001, the Company assumed, as part of the acquisition of The
Richard E. Jacobs  Group's  interests  in 21 malls and two  associated  centers;
total debt  obligations of $745.5  million,  including  permanent debt of $661.5
million (adjusted for a minority interest in one property);  variable-rate  debt
of $12.5  million;  and its pro rata share of  mortgage  debt on  unconsolidated
properties  (accounted  for  under  the  equity  method)  of $71.5  million.  In
addition,  the Company closed a $212 million  unsecured credit facility provided
by a consortium of banks led by Wells Fargo. The balance on this credit facility
at  December  31,  2001 was $55.1  with  $94.3  million  available  for  capital
improvements.

     Based on the debt (including construction projects) and the market value of
equity described above, the Company's debt to total market  capitalization (debt
plus market value  equity)  ratio was 59.2% at December 31, 2001,  compared with
59.4% at December 31, 2000.

</TABLE>

     The Company has also  entered  into a number of option  agreements  for the
development  of future  regional malls and community  centers.  Except for these
projects and as further  described  below,  the Company  currently  has no other
capital commitments.

     It is  management's  expectation  that the  Company  will  continue to have
access to the  capital  resources  necessary  to expand  and grow its  business.
Future development and acquisition  activities will be undertaken by the Company
as  suitable  opportunities  arise.  Such  activities  are  not  expected  to be
undertaken unless adequate sources of financing are available and a satisfactory
budget with targeted returns on investment has been internally approved.

     The Company  will fund its major  development,  expansion  and  acquisition
activity  with its  traditional  sources  of  construction  and  permanent  debt
financing  as well as from other debt and equity  financings,  including  public
financings, and its credit facilities.


OTHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

     Management prepares an annual capital expenditures budget for each property
which is intended to provide for all necessary  recurring  capital  improvements
and maintenance items. Management believes that its annual operating reserve for
maintenance and recurring capital  improvements as well as  reimbursements  from
tenants will provide the necessary  funding for such  requirements.  The Company
intends to distribute approximately 50% to 90% of its funds from operations with
the  remaining 10% to 50% to be held as a reserve for capital  expenditures  and
continued growth opportunities.

     Major  tenant  finish costs for  currently  vacant space are expected to be
funded with working capital,  operating reserves,  or revolving lines of credit.
Funds  invested  for tenant  finish  costs are expected to earn a return on that
investment.  For the year ended December 31, 2001,  revenue  generating  capital
expenditures,  or tenant allowances for improvements,  were $23.5 million. These
capital  expenditures  generate  a return  through  increased  rents  from these
tenants over the term of their leases.  Revenue enhancing capital  expenditures,
or remodeling and renovation  costs,  were $26.6 million,  the majority of which
was for  the  renovation  of  Burnsville  Center  in  Minneapolis  (Burnsville),
Minnesota  and  Meridian  Mall in Lansing  (Okemos),  Michigan  in the  existing
portfolio and Fashion Square Mall in Saginaw,  Michigan and Cary Towne Center in
Cary, North Carolina in the newly acquired  portfolio.  Certain items of revenue
enhancing capital  expenditures such as flooring and parking lot resurfacing are
billed to tenants  and a portion is  recovered  from  tenants.  Revenue  neutral
capital  expenditures,  such as  parking  lot and roof  repairs,  are  billed to
tenants and a portion is recovered  from  tenants.  During 2001 Revenue  neutral
expenditures were $14.0 million. The billing and recovery of revenue neutral and
certain revenue  enhancing  expenditures  occurs  generally over a 10 to 20 year
period.


Environmental Matters

     The Company  believes that the Properties are in compliance in all material
respects with all federal,  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding
the  handling,  discharge,  and emission of hazardous or toxic  substances.  The
Company has not been notified by any governmental authority and is not otherwise
aware of any material  noncompliance,  liability, or claim relating to hazardous
or toxic substances in connection with any of its present or former  properties.
The Company has not recorded in its financial  statements any material liability
in connection with environmental matters.

Cash Flows

     Cash flows  provided by operating  activities  for 2001  increased by $51.3
million,  or 43.6%, to $169.1 million from $117.8 million in 2000. This increase
was primarily due to increases in cash provided by the  operations of thirty-one
new  centers  opened  or  acquired  in the last  twenty-four  months  offset  by
decreases in cash flow from the sales of nineteen properties. Cash flows used in
investing  activities for 2001 increased by $80.0 million,  or 63.0%,  to $207.1
million compared with $127.1 million in 2000. This increase was primarily due to
the acquisition of 21 malls and two associated centers and capital investment in
properties in 2001 compared with the smaller number of acquisitions  and capital
investment  in 2000.  Cash  flows  provided  by  financing  activities  for 2001
increased by $35.6  million,  or 482.8%,  to $43.0  million from $7.4 million in
2000. This increase is primarily due to increases in the acquisition program.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

     In the last three years,  inflation has not had a significant impact on the
Company because of the relatively low inflation rate.  Substantially  all tenant
leases do, however,  contain provisions designed to protect the Company from the
impact of inflation.  Such provisions  include  clauses  enabling the Company to
receive  percentage  rentals  based on tenants'  gross  sales,  which  generally
increase as prices rise, and/or  escalation  clauses,  which generally  increase
rental rates during the terms of the leases. In addition, many of the leases are
for  terms of less than ten  years  which may  enable  the  Company  to  replace
existing  leases  with new leases at higher base  and/or  percentage  rentals if
rents from the existing leases are below the then-existing  market rate. Most of
the  leases  require  the  tenants  to pay their  share of  operating  expenses,
including  common area  maintenance,  real estate taxes and  insurance,  thereby
reducing the  Company's  exposure to increases in costs and  operating  expenses
resulting from inflation.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     In December 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission requested that all
registrants  list their most  "critical  accounting  policies" in MD&A.  The SEC
indicated that a "critical  accounting policy" is one which is both important to
the  portrayal  of a company's  financial  condition  and  results and  requires
significant judgement or complex estimation processes.  Management believes that
the Company's accounting policies that are the most significant and that require
the most judgement are within its accounting for the  development of real estate
projects. Management believes that the following accounting policies within this
process  fit  the   definition   described   above.   The  Company   capitalizes
predevelopment costs paid to third parties incurred on a project. All previously

                                       47

                Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
                     Condition and Results of Operations

capitalized predevelopment costs are expensed when it is no longer probable that
the project will be completed.  Once  development  of a project  commences,  the
Company  capitalizes  all  direct  costs  incurred  to  construct  the  project,
including  interest  and real estate  taxes.  In addition,  certain  general and
administrative  expenses are allocated to the projects and capitalized  based on
the personnel assigned to development and the investment in the project relative
to all development projects.  Once a project is completed and placed in service,
it is depreciated over its estimated useful life. Buildings and improvements are
depreciated  generally  over 40 years and leasehold  improvements  are amortized
over the lives of the  applicable  leases or the  estimated  useful  life of the
asset, whichever is shorter.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In June 2001,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 141,  "Business  Combinations"  and
SFAS  No.  142  "Goodwill  and  Other  Intangible   Assets"   (collectively  the
"Standards").  The Standards will be effective for fiscal years  beginning after
December 15, 2001.  Companies with fiscal years  beginning  after March 15, 2001
may early  adopt,  but only as of the  beginning of that fiscal year and only if
all existing  goodwill is  evaluated  for  impairment  by the end of that fiscal
year.  SFAS No. 141 will require  companies to recognize  acquired  identifiable
assets  separately from goodwill if control over the future economic benefits of
the assets  results from  contractual  or other legal  rights or the  intangible
assets is capable of being separated or divided and sold, transferred, licensed,
rented,  or  exchanged.  The  Standards  will  require  the value of  separately
identifiable intangible assets meeting any of the criteria to be measured at its
fair value.  SFAS No. 142 will require that goodwill not be amortized,  and that
amounts recorded as goodwill be tested for impairment. Upon adoption of SFAS No.
142,  goodwill will be reduced if it is found to be impaired.  Annual impairment
tests  will have to be  performed  at the  lowest  level of an entity  that is a
business and that can be  distinguished,  physically and  operationally  and for
internal reporting purposes, from the other activities,  operations,  and assets
of the entity.  The Company  believes the impact of the new goodwill  impairment
standards will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or
results of operations.

     In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets".  SFAS No. 144 addresses financial  accounting
and reporting for the impairment of long-lived  assets and for long-lived assets
to be disposed of. SFAS No. 144  supersedes  SFAS No. 121,  "Accounting  for the
Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to be Disposed of""
and among other factors,  establishes  criteria beyond that previously specified
in SFAS No. 121 to be determine  when a long-lived  asset is to be considered as
held for sale. The Company adopted SFAS No. 144 effective January 1, 2002 and is
currently evaluating its impact.

Funds from Operations

     Management   believes  that  Funds  from  Operations  ("FFO")  provides  an
additional  indicator of the financial  performance  of the  Properties.  FFO is
defined by the Company as net income (loss) before  depreciation  of real estate
assets,  gains or  losses  on sales  of real  estate  and  gains  or  losses  on
investments in marketable  securities.  FFO also includes the Company's share of
FFO in unconsolidated  properties and excludes minority  interests' share of FFO
in  consolidated  properties.  The Company  computes FFO in accordance  with the
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' ("NAREIT") recommendation
concerning finance costs and non-real estate depreciation.  The Company excludes
gains or losses on outparcel  sales,  even though NAREIT permits their inclusion
when  calculating FFO. Gains on outparcel sales would have added $2.2 million to
FFO in 2001 compared with $5.4 million in 2000.

     The use of FFO as an indicator of financial  performance  is influenced not
only by the operations of the Properties,  but also by the capital  structure of
the Operating Partnership and the Company. Accordingly,  management expects that
FFO will be one of the significant  factors considered by the Board of Directors
in determining the amount of cash  distributions the Operating  Partnership will
make to its partners (including the Company).  Management also believes that FFO
is a widely used measure of the  operating  performance  of REITs and provides a
relevant basis for comparison among companies.  FFO does not represent cash flow
from operations as defined by accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
United States  ("GAAP"),  is not necessarily  indicative of cash from operations
available  to fund all cash flow  needs,  and  should  not be  considered  as an
alternative  to net income for purposes of evaluating  the  Company's  operating
performance,  for evaluating the impact of capital  investments in the Company's
properties or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

     Effective  January 1, 2000,  NAREIT  clarified FFO to include all operating
results  -  recurring  and  non-recurring  - except  those  results  defined  as
"extraordinary  items" under  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
United States.  The Company  implemented this clarification in the first quarter
of 2000 and no  longer  adds  back to FFO the  write-off  of  development  costs
charged to net income.  This amount was  $2,032,000  for the year ended December
31, 2001 and $127,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. The cost of interest
rate caps and finance costs on the  Company's  lines of credit are amortized and
included in interest expense and, therefore, reduces FFO.

                Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
                     Condition and Results of Operations

     In 2001,  FFO  increased  by $62.0  million,  or 46.9%,  to $194.0  million
compared  with  $132.0  million  in  2000.  The  increase  in FFO was  primarily
attributable  to the income from  operations  from  twenty-three  Newly Acquired
Properties  and the opening and  acquisitions  of eight  properties  in the last
twenty-four months and higher rents in the Company's stabilized portfolio offset
by decreases in FFO from the sales of properties.

The Company's calculation of FFO is as follows (in thousands):

ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7 above and in Note 9 to the
Financial Statements.

     The fair  value of the  Company's  long  term  debt is  estimated  based on
discounted  cash flows at interest rates that management  believes  reflects the
risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



To CBL & Associates Properties, Inc.:

     We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of CBL &
ASSOCIATES  PROPERTIES,  INC. (a Delaware  corporation)  and  subsidiaries as of
December  31,  2001  and  2000,  and  the  related  consolidated  statements  of
operations,  shareholders'  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the  period  ended  December  31,  2001.  These  financial  statements  are  the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of CBL & Associates Properties,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the United States.

     Our audit was made for the  purpose  of  forming  an  opinion  on the basic
financial  statements  taken as a whole.  The  schedules  listed in the index to
financial  statements  are  presented  for the  purpose  of  complying  with the
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission's  rules  and  are not  part of the  basic
financial  statements.  These  schedules  have been  subjected  to the  auditing
procedures  applied in the audit of the basic  financial  statements and, in our
opinion, fairly state in all material respects the financial data required to be
set forth  therein in  relation  to the basic  financial  statements  taken as a
whole.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.       ORGANIZATION

     CBL & Associates Properties,  Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation,
is engaged in the development,  acquisition,  and operation of regional shopping
malls and community  centers,  primarily in the Southeast and select  markets in
the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States.  The Company is the 100%
owner of two qualified REIT subsidiaries,  CBL Holdings I, Inc. and CBL Holdings
II, Inc.,  which are the sole general partner and majority owner,  respectively,
of CBL & Associates  Limited  Partnership  (the "Operating  Partnership").  As a
result,  the Company  conducts its business  through the Operating  Partnership,
which at December  31,  2001,  owns  controlling  interests  in a  portfolio  of
properties consisting of 45 regional malls; 16 associated centers, each of which
is part of a regional  shopping mall complex;  two power  centers;  68 community
centers; and two office buildings.  Additionally, the Operating Partnership owns
non-controlling  interests in seven regional  malls and two associated  centers.
The Operating  Partnership  has one mall and one mall expansion  currently under
construction and has options to acquire certain development  properties owned by
third  parties.  At December 31, 2001, CBL Holdings I, Inc. owned a 1.9% general
partnership interest and CBL Holdings II, Inc. owned a 49.2% limited partnership
interest  in the  Operating  Partnership  for a  combined  interest  held by the
Company of 51.1%.

     The minority interest in the Operating Partnership is held primarily by CBL
& Associates,  Inc. and its affiliates (collectively "CBL") and by affiliates of
the Richard E Jacobs Group, Inc. ("Jacobs").  CBL contributed their interests in
certain real estate  properties and joint ventures to the Operating  Partnership
in exchange for a limited partnership  interest in connection with the formation
of  the  Operating  Partnership  in  November  1993.  Jacobs  contributed  their
interests in certain real estate  properties and joint ventures to the Operating
Partnership in exchange for a limited  partnership  interest in connection  with
the acquisition by the Operating  Partnership of 23 properties discussed in Note
3. At  December  31,  2001,  CBL and  Jacobs  owned a 17.7%  and  22.8%  limited
partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, respectively (Note 11).

     To comply with certain technical  requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the  "Code"),  the  Operating  Partnership  carries out the
Company's  property   management  and  development   activities  through  CBL  &
Associates   Management,   Inc.  (the  "Management   Company").   The  Operating
Partnership  holds 100% of the preferred stock and 5% of the common stock of the
Management  Company,  with CBL holding the  remaining  95% of the common  stock.
Through the ownership of the preferred stock, the Operating Partnership receives
substantially all of the cash flow and, therefore,  enjoys  substantially all of
the  economic  benefits  of  the  Management  Company's  operations.  Due to the
Company's ability, as sole general partner, to control the Operating Partnership
and the  Operating  Partnership's  rights to  substantially  all of the economic
benefits of the Management Company,  the accounts of each entity are included in
the accompanying  consolidated financial statements.  The Company, the Operating
Partnership,  and the  Management  Company are referred to  collectively  as the
"Company".

     All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in the consolidated presentation.

2.       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Real Estate Assets

     Costs directly related to the development of real estate assets,  including
overhead costs directly attributable to property  development,  are capitalized.
Interest costs  incurred  during the  development  and  construction  period are
capitalized.

     Ordinary   repairs  and  maintenance   are  expensed  as  incurred.   Major
replacements  and  improvements  are  capitalized  and  depreciated  over  their
estimated  useful  lives.  Depreciation  is  computed on a  straight-line  basis
generally over 40 years for buildings,  10 to 20 years for certain  improvements
and seven to ten years for  equipment  and  fixtures.  Tenant  improvements  are
capitalized  and  depreciated  on a  straight-line  basis  over  the life of the
related lease.

                   Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

Long-Lived Assets

     The Company periodically  evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets
to be held and used when  events or  changes  in  circumstances  warrant  such a
review. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the
projected  undiscounted future cash flow of such asset is less than its carrying
value.  Management  believes that no material impairment existed at December 31,
2001, and accordingly, no loss was recognized.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Cash and cash equivalents include all cash and cash equivalent  investments
with original maturities of three months or less, primarily consisting of demand
deposits in banks.

Deferred Financing Costs

     Deferred  financing costs are included in other assets in the  accompanying
consolidated balance sheets, include fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term
financing,  and are being  amortized  and charged to interest  expense  over the
terms of the respective  notes  payable.  Amortization  expense was  $4,766,000,
$2,072,000 and $1,506,000 in 2001,  2000,  and 1999,  respectively.  Accumulated
amortization  was  $13,096,000  and  $9,872,000  as of  December  2001 and 2000,
respectively.  Unamortized  deferred  financing costs are written off when notes
payable are retired before the maturity date.

Revenue Recognition

     Rental  revenue  attributable  to  operating  leases  is  recognized  on  a
straight-line basis over the initial term of the related leases. Certain tenants
are required to pay additional rent if sales volume exceeds  specified  amounts.
The Company  recognizes this additional rent as revenue when such amounts become
determinable.  A substantial  portion of the Company's  rental income is derived
from various national and regional retail companies.

Tenant Reimbursements

     The Company  receives  reimbursements  from  tenants  for certain  costs as
provided  in the lease  agreements.  These costs  consist of real estate  taxes,
common area maintenance,  and other recoverable costs. Tenant reimbursements are
recognized as revenue in the period the costs are incurred.

Management, Development and Leasing Fees

     The Company's  derives its management fees and development  fees from third
parties  and  unconsolidated  affiliates.  Management  fees  are  charged  as  a
percentage of rentals and are recognized as revenue as they are earned.  Leasing
fees are  charged  for newly  executed  leases.  These  fees are  recognized  as
revenues as they are earned. Development fees are recognized as revenue on a pro
rata basis over the development period.

Gain on Sales of Real Estate Assets

     Gain on sales of real estate  assets is recognized at the time title to the
asset is  transferred  to the buyer,  subject  to the  adequacy  of the  buyer's
initial and continuing  investment and the assumption by the buyer of all future
ownership risks of the asset.

Income Taxes

     The Company is qualified as a real estate  investment  trust under Sections
856 through 860 of the Code and  applicable  treasury  regulations.  In order to
maintain  qualification  as a real  estate  investment  trust,  the  Company  is
currently  required  to  distribute  at  least  90% of  its  taxable  income  to
shareholders  and meet  certain  other  asset and income  tests as well as other
requirements.  As a real estate investment trust, the Company will generally not
be liable for federal  corporate  income  taxes.  Thus, no provision for federal
income  taxes  has been  included  in the  accompanying  consolidated  financial
statements. If the Company fails to qualify as a real estate investment trust in
any  taxable  year,  the  Company  will be subject to federal  income tax on its
taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if the Company maintains its
qualification for taxation as a real estate investment trust, the Company may be
subject to certain  state and local  taxes on its  income and  property,  and to
federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed  income. State income taxes
were not significant in 2001, 2000 and 1999.

                   Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

Derivative Financial Instruments

     Interest rate cap and swap  agreements,  which are principally  used by the
Company in the  management  of interest rate  exposure,  are accounted for on an
accrual  basis.  At  January 1,  2001,  the  Company  implemented  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 133,  "Accounting  for Derivative
Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities",  as  amended,  ("SFAS  No.  133")  which
establishes  accounting and reporting  standards requiring that every derivative
instrument   (including  certain  derivative   instruments   embedded  in  other
contracts)  be  recorded in the  balance  sheet as either an asset or  liability
measured at its fair value.  Amounts to be paid or received  under interest rate
cap and swap agreements are recorded in interest  expense in the period in which
they accrue. See Note 9 for additional information.

Concentration of Credit Risk

     The Company's  tenants consist of national,  regional and local  retailers.
Financial instruments which subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk
consist primarily of tenant receivables.  The Company does not obtain collateral
or other security to support  financial  instruments  subject to credit risk but
monitors the credit standing of tenants.

Earnings Per Share

     Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing earnings available
to common  shareholders by the  weighted-average  number of unrestricted  common
shares  outstanding  for the period.  Diluted EPS assumes the issuance of common
stock  for  all  potential  dilutive  common  shares  outstanding.  The  limited
partners' rights to convert their minority interest in the Operating Partnership
into shares of common stock are not dilutive  (Note 11). The difference in basic
and diluted EPS is due to the assumed exercise of outstanding  stock options and
restricted stock resulting in 475,000,  140,000,  and 187,000 potential dilutive
common shares in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

     The  Company  accounts  for  its  stock-based   compensation   plans  under
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to
Employees"  (APB No. 25).  Effective in 1996, the Company adopted the disclosure
option of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation." SFAS No. 123
requires companies that do not choose to account for stock-based compensation as
prescribed  by the statement to disclose the pro forma effects on net income and
earnings  per  share as if SFAS No.  123 had been  adopted.  See Note 13 for the
required disclosures.

Use of Estimates

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in conformity  with  accounting
principles  generally accepted in the United States requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements,  and the  reported  amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

3.       ACQUISITIONS

     On  January  31,  2001,  the  Company  completed  the  first  stage  of the
acquisition of Jacobs interests in 21 malls and two associated centers for total
consideration  of  approximately  $1.26  billion,  including the  acquisition of
minority  interests in certain  properties.  The purchase price was comprised of
$124.5 million in cash,  including  closing costs of approximately  $12 million;
the assumption of $745.5 million in non-recourse mortgage debt; and the issuance
of 12,056,692 special common units of the Operating  Partnership with a value of
$27.25 per unit.  The cash portion was funded from a new $212 million  unsecured
credit  facility  provided  by a  consortium  of banks led by Wells  Fargo.  The
Company  will close on the second  stage in 2002,  which will consist of cash of
$0.3 million, the assumption of $25.7 million in non-recourse mortgage debt, and
the issuance of 499,733 special common units of the Operating  Partnership.  The
results of operations  attributable to the properties  acquired from Jacobs have
been included in the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  from the date of
acquisition.

     The following unaudited pro forma financial  information for the year ended

7.      MINIMUM RENTS

     Tenant  leases are usually for 5 to 20 year periods and  generally  provide
for renewals and annual rentals which are subject to upward adjustments based on
tenant sales volume.  Future  minimum  rents are scheduled to be received  under
noncancellable tenant leases at December 31, 2001, as follows (in thousands):

     No single tenant  collectively  accounts for more than 10% of the Company's
total revenues.

8.      PREFERRED STOCK

     The Company has  authorized  5,000,000  shares of preferred  stock of which
2,875,000  shares of 9% Series A  Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Stock  (the
"Series A  Preferred  Stock")  with a face  value of $25.00  per share have been
issued.  The dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are cumulative and accrue
from the date of issue and are payable  quarterly  in arrears at a rate of $2.25
per share per annum. The Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity, is not
subject to any sinking fund or mandatory  redemption and is not redeemable prior
to July 1, 2003.  On or after July 1, 2003,  the Company may redeem the Series A
Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time for a cash redemption price of
$25.00 per share, plus dividends accrued and unpaid.

9.      DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The  Company  has  only  limited  involvement  with  derivative   financial
instruments and does not use them for trading purposes.  They are used to manage
well defined interest rate risks.

     Under interest rate swap agreements,  the Company agrees with other parties
to exchange,  at specified  intervals,  the  difference  between  fixed rate and
variable  rate  interest  amounts  calculated  by  reference  to an  agreed-upon
notional amount. Under these agreements,  the Company receives interest payments
at a rate equal to LIBOR (5.33% at December 31, 2001) and pays interest at fixed
rates shown below.

     The Company has the following  interest rate swaps in place at December 31,
2001, totaling $220 million:

                   Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements


     The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of  nonperformance  by
the   counterparties   to  its  interest  rate  swap  agreements.   The  Company
anticipates,  however,  that  counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their
obligations under the contracts. The Company does not obtain collateral or other
security to support  financial  instruments  subject to credit risk but monitors
the credit standing of counterparties.

     Effective January 1, 2001 the Company determined that with the exception of
two swaps that expired during the first quarter of 2001 the Company's derivative
instruments were effective and qualified for hedge accounting in accordance with
SFAS No. 133. The Company also determined that new swap agreements  obtained in
2001 were effective and qualified for hedge accounting. The Company measured the
effectiveness  of these  instruments  in place  during each  quarter in the year
ended December 31, 2001 and determined that the swap agreements  continued to be
highly effective and continued to qualify for hedge accounting.  At December 31,
2001 the effective swap agreements  were recorded on the  consolidated  balance
sheet  at  their  fair  values  of  $6.8  million  in  accrued  liabilities  and
accumulated other comprehensive loss. Over time, the unrealized gains and losses
held in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to earnings as
interest  expense as swap  payments  are made to the swap  counterparties.  This
reclassification  is  consistent  with  the  timing  of when  hedged  items  are
recognized in earnings.  Within the next twelve months,  the Company  expects to
reclassify  to earnings as interest  expense an  estimated  $5.2  million of the
current balance held in accumulated other comprehensive loss.


10.     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The carrying  values of cash and cash  equivalents,  receivables,  accounts
payable,  and accrued liabilities are reasonable  estimates of their fair values
because  of the short  maturity  of these  financial  instruments.  Based on the
interest rates for similar financial instruments, the carrying value of mortgage
notes receivable is a reasonable estimation of fair value. The carrying value of
mortgage and other notes payable,  based on borrowing rates currently  available
to the Company,  is a reasonable  estimation  of fair value at December 31, 2001
and 2000.

11.     CONVERSION RIGHTS

     Pursuant to the Operating Partnership agreement,  the limited partners have
the right to convert their  partnership  interests in the Operating  Partnership
into  shares of common  stock,  subject  to certain  limits,  and to sell to the
Company part or all of their partnership  interest in the Operating  Partnership
in exchange for shares of common stock or their cash equivalent at the Company's
election, as defined.

     In  connection  with the  acquisitions  discussed in Note 3, the  Operating
Partnership issued 12,659,677 special common units in the Operating Partnership.
After  January 31, 2004 the special  common units may be exchanged for shares of
common stock or cash at the Company's  election.  The distribution  rate for the
special  common units is $2.9025 per unit.  The special  common units  receive a
minimum  distribution of $2.9025 per unit.  When the  distribution on the common
units  exceeds  $2.9025 per unit,  the special  limited  partnership  units will
receive a distribution equal to that paid on the common units.

     The  Operating  Partnership  acquired  properties  from CBL in exchange for
1,336 common units in the Operating  Partnership  valued at $27,000 during 2000.
In October 1999 the Company issued 79,715 common units valued at $1,928,000 to a
third party in exchange for land.

     At December 31, 2001 and 2000, there remained outstanding rights to convert
CBL's minority interest in the Operating  Partnership to 8,884,728 and 8,884,728
shares of common  stock,  respectively.  At December  31,  2001 and 2000,  there
remained  outstanding rights to convert third parties' minority interests in the
Operating  Partnership  to  2,972,486  and  2,941,360  shares of  common  stock,
respectively.  The  total  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  and  Operating
Partnership  units was 350,134,000 and 36,893,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2000,
respectivley.

12.     401(K) PROFIT SHARING PLAN

     The Management  Company  maintains a 401(k) profit  sharing plan,  which is
qualified under Section 401(a) and Section 401(k) of the Code to cover employees
of the  Management  Company.  All  employees who have attained the age of 21 and
have  completed at least one year of service are eligible to  participate in the
plan. The plan provides for employer  matching  contributions  on behalf of each
participant equal to 50% of the portion of such participant's contribution which

                                       71

                   Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements


does not  exceed  2.5% of such  participant's  compensation  for the plan  year.
Additionally,  the  Management  Company has the  discretion  to make  additional
profit-sharing-type   contributions   not   related  to   participant   elective
contributions.   Total   contributions  by  the  Management   Company  were  not
significant for 2001, 2000, and 1999.

13.     STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

     The Company  maintains  the CBL & Associates  Properties,  Inc.  1993 Stock
Incentive  Plan,  as amended  (the "Plan")  which  permits the issuance of stock
options and common stock to selected  officers,  employees  and directors of the
Company.  The shares  available  under the plan were increased from 2,800,000 to
4,000,000 during 2001. The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors (the "Committee").

     Stock options  issued under the Plan allow for the purchase of common stock
at the fair  market  value of the  stock at the  date of  grant.  Stock  options
granted to officers and employees under the Plan vest and become  exercisable in
installments  on each of the first five  anniversaries  of the date of grant and
expire ten years after the date of grant.  Stock options  granted to independent
directors are fully vested upon grant, but may not be sold, pledged or otherwise
transferred in any manner during the director's term or for one year thereafter.

     The Company accounts for its stock-based  compensation  plans under APB No.
25, under which no  compensation  expense has been  recognized for stock options
granted as all employee  options have been granted with an exercise  price equal
to the fair value of the Company's  common stock on the date of grant.  For SFAS
No.  123  purposes,  the  fair  value of each  employee  option  grant  has been
estimated as of the date of grant using the  Black-Sholes  option  pricing model
and the following weighted average assumptions for 2001, 2000 and 1999.

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                                   2001             2000            1999

<S>                                 <C>              <C>             <C>
Risk free interest rate             5.07%            6.65%           5.25%
Dividend yield                      8.34%            8.98%           8.33%
Expected volatility                18.00%           17.00%          16.00%
Expected life                   5.9 years        6.0 years       7.2 years
</TABLE>

     Using  these  assumptions,  the fair value of the  employee  stock  options
granted in 2001, 2000 and 1999 is $568,000, $500,000 and $468,000, respectively,
which would be amortized as compensation  expense over the vesting period of the
options.  Had compensation  cost for the Plan been determined in accordance with
SFAS No. 123, utilizing the assumptions  detailed above, the Company's pro forma
net income and net  income  per share  would have been as follows  for the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively (in thousands,  except per
share data):

</TABLE>


     The pro forma effect on net income in this disclosure is not representative
of the pro forma effect on net income in future  years  because it does not take
into consideration pro forma  compensation  expense related to grants made prior
to 1995.

15.        CONTINGENCIES

     The  Company is  currently  involved in certain  litigation  arising in the
ordinary  course  of  business.  In  the  opinion  of  management,  the  pending
litigation  will not  materially  affect the  financial  position  or results of
operations  of  the  Company.  Additionally,   based  on  environmental  studies
completed to date on the real estate  properties,  management  believes exposure
related to environmental  cleanup will not be material to the financial position
and results of operations of the Company.
