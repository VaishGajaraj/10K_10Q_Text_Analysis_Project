<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Overview  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ameriprise Financial,&nbsp;Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Delaware primarily engaged in business through its subsidiaries. Accordingly,
references
below to "we," "us" and "our" may refer to Ameriprise Financial,&nbsp;Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies or to one or more of our subsidiaries. Our headquarters are located at 55
Ameriprise Financial Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55474. We also maintain executive offices in New York City. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are engaged in providing financial planning, products and services that are designed to be utilized as solutions for our clients' cash and liquidity, asset accumulation, income,
protection, and estate and wealth transfer needs. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, we had approximately 2.8&nbsp;million individual, business and institutional clients and a network of more than
11,800 financial advisors and registered representatives ("affiliated financial advisors"). Our asset management, annuity, and auto and home protection products are also distributed outside of our
affiliated financial advisors, through third party advisors and affinity relationships. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
strive to deliver solutions to our clients through an approach focused on building long term personal relationships. We offer financial planning and advice that aims to be responsive
to our clients' evolving needs and helps them achieve their identified financial goals by recommending clients' actions and a range of product "solutions" consisting of investment, annuities,
insurance, banking and other
financial products that position our clients to realize a positive return or form of protection while accepting what they determine to be an appropriate range and level of risk. The financial product
solutions we offer through our affiliated advisors include both our own products and services and products of other companies. Our financial planning and advisory process is designed to provide
comprehensive advice, when appropriate, to address our clients' cash and liquidity, asset accumulation, income, protection, and estate and wealth transfer needs. We believe that our focus on personal
relationships, together with our strengths in financial planning and product development, allows us to better address our clients' financial needs, including the financial needs of our primary target
market segment, the mass affluent and affluent, which we define as households with investable assets of more than $100,000. This focus also puts us in a strong position to capitalize on significant
demographic and market trends, which we believe will continue to drive increased demand for our financial planning and other financial services. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
multi-platform network of affiliated financial advisors is the means by which we develop personal relationships with clients. We refer to the affiliated financial advisors who use
our brand name (who numbered more than 10,200 at December&nbsp;31, 2007) as our branded advisors, and those who do not use our brand name but who are affiliated as registered representatives of ours
as our unbranded advisors (who numbered over 1,600 at December&nbsp;31, 2007). Our branded advisor network is also the primary distribution channel through which we offer our investment products and
services, as well as a range of banking and protection products. We offer our branded advisors training, tools, leadership, marketing programs and other field and centralized support to assist them in
delivering product solutions to clients. We believe our approach not only improves the products and services we provide to clients, but also allows us to reinvest in enhanced services for clients and
support available to our affiliated financial advisors. This integrated model also affords us a better understanding of our client base, which allows us to better manage the risk profile of our
businesses. We believe our focus on meeting clients' needs through personal financial planning results in more satisfied clients with deeper, longer lasting relationships with our company and higher
retention of experienced financial advisors. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Our Principal Brands  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use two brand names for our businesses: Ameriprise Financial and RiverSource. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
use Ameriprise Financial as our holding company brand, as well as the name of our branded advisor network and certain of our retail products and services. The retail products and
services that utilize the Ameriprise brand include some products and services that we provide through our branded advisors (e.g.,&nbsp;investment advisory accounts, retail brokerage services and
banking products) and some products and services that we market directly to consumers (e.g.,&nbsp;personal auto and home insurance). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
use our RiverSource brand for our asset management, annuity, and the majority of our protection products. Products that utilize the RiverSource name include retail and institutional
asset management products, annuities and life and disability income insurance products. We believe that using a distinct brand for these products, including our retail mutual funds, permits
differentiation from our branded advisor network. </FONT></P>

financial planning approach helps to meet our clients' financial needs and fosters deep and long-term client relationships. We estimate that, of those clients who have received a financial
plan or who have entered into an agreement to receive and have paid for a financial plan from our branded advisors, over 75% have been with us for three or more years, with an attrition rate of less
than 1% per year. Our branded advisor clients with more than $100,000 in assets with us have been with us, on average, more than twelve years. More than 67% of these clients have received a financial
plan or have entered into an agreement to receive and have paid for a financial plan and these clients hold an average of more than four products. We believe the depth of our branded advisor client
relationships and portion of a client's liquid or investable assets (excluding 401(k) assets, employee stock plans and real estate) is leading in the industry.

segment.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Our branded advisors offer our clients financial planning and other advisory services as well as certain banking and brokerage services. Our branded advisor network
included the largest number of CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER&reg; professionals of any retail advisory force (based on data filed at adviserinfo.sec.gov and documented by the Certified Financial
Planner Board of Standards,&nbsp;Inc. as of December&nbsp;31, 2006). Ameriprise is America's largest financial planning company. We believe our focus
on financial planning positions us well to capitalize on the demographic trends in our target segment, particularly as they prepare for retirement. The mass affluent and affluent market segment
accounts for about 90% of the $21 trillion of U.S. investable assets (according to the MacroMonitor 2006-2007 consumer survey prepared by SRI Consulting Business Intelligence). We have
found that more than 58% of consumers in our target segment are willing to pay a knowledgeable advisor for financial advice to address their immediate and long-term needs in the context of
their entire financial situation (MacroMonitor 2006-2007 survey prepared by SRI Consulting Business Intelligence). We believe the financial planning process not only helps us to develop
more tailored solutions designed to address our clients' financial needs, but also helps us develop a better understanding of the demographics and trends among our clients. We believe our approach
results in increased client satisfaction, longer-term relationships with our clients and better risk profiles in our Protection segment. Our experience has shown that by helping our
clients in their efforts to meet their financial needs through our financial planning approach, clients with an implemented financial planning relationship hold approximately three times more invested
assets with our company than clients without a financial plan.

presence also played a prominent role in the evolution of our advertising for the Ameriprise brand in 2007. New network and cable television advertising drove consumers to our Ameriprise.com
website, and reinforced the message that "Today, more people come to Ameriprise for financial planning than any other company." To increase RiverSource brand awareness among investment professionals,
in 2007 RiverSource Investments launched its first advertising campaign, which included a series of print and online advertisements in financial trade publications. We also utilize alliance
arrangements to expand awareness of our brands, to support financial advisor recruitment and client acquisition efforts, and to define our advantages for prospective new clients and distribution
partners. For more information on our alliances, see "Business&#151;Our Segments&#151;Advice&nbsp;&amp; Wealth Management&#151;Brokerage and Investment Advisory

our branded advisors address the changing needs of our clients, we continue to develop methods for advisors to introduce, when appropriate, non-financial plan clients to the financial
planning process and to assist financial planning clients to more fully implement plans they have in place. We are also increasing our efforts to assist our advisors in delivering a consistent and
compelling client experience. We have created segmented service offerings, such as Ameriprise Gold Advantage and Ameriprise Platinum Advantage, to provide recognition, special benefits and higher
levels of service to our mass affluent and affluent clients. In addition, through the information we learn from supporting our branded advisor network and the market research we conduct with our
existing client base, we identify opportunities to build deeper relationships with clients by addressing potentially underserved needs. We believe that deeper, longer-term relationships
with our clients foster, among other things, increased satisfaction among our clients and branded financial advisors and greater owned, managed and administered assets. We also believe that strong
relationships with existing clients foster the acquisition of new clients through referrals, which has long been a leading source of new clients.

and 2020, the 45-64 age group&#151;typically the prime financial and asset accumulation years for retirement&#151;is projected to grow by 34%, with most of that growth
occurring by 2010. In addition, we provide support to our branded advisors

continue to enhance the productivity of our affiliated financial advisor network, including our branded and unbranded platforms, by providing leading technological tools, client acquisition programs

seek to offer franchises to quality individuals, offering a choice of affiliation (employee, franchisee or employee or contractor of a franchisee). We continue to enhance the support available to our
branded advisors in areas such as leadership, technology, training, marketing, financial planning and a broad set of products and services. We charge a fee to our franchisee branded advisors for some
of these services. We believe this support helps our branded advisors acquire more of our target clients, deliver a more consistent experience and serve clients with a wide range of products and
services. We are continuing our focused recruitment efforts by recruiting individuals who are new to the industry, as well as attracting experienced financial advisors through both individual
recruitment and practice acquisitions. Our branded advisor network model provides flexibility to our branded advisors in building and managing their individual practices, which we believe leads to
better retention. We design our compensation plans, including our equity compensation plans for employee and franchisee branded advisors, to foster, among other things, greater levels of financial
advisor productivity and retention. With regard to our unbranded advisors, who are offered a lower level of firm-provided support in exchange for higher levels of compensation, our
strategy is to continue to profitably grow this platform.

continuing to leverage our top talent and selectively growing our investment management talent pool. We intend to grow our talent pool by organic means (through strengthening of our investment
management teams), by external means (through continuing to recruit individuals and teams of investment professionals with strong track records and potentially making
opportunistic acquisitions of well-performing investment management firms) and through the utilization of sub-advisors as appropriate. We intend to continue investing in tools
and resources to assist both our fixed income and equity investment management teams to improve performance while managing risk effectively through the consistent application of risk management
processes. Our fixed income investment management teams utilize BlackRock Solutions&reg;, a leading portfolio management, trading and risk management tool, in better analyzing and isolating
the effects of specific factors affecting performance of fixed income portfolios. In equities, we employ a multi-platform approach using highly accountable investment management teams with dedicated
analytical and equity trading resources. Each team focuses on particular investment strategies that are accessible through multiple distribution channels, supported by the Charles River equity trading
and compliance system. We believe that maintaining consistent investment performance will positively impact long-term growth in our managed assets.

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our company has more than 110&nbsp;years of history of providing financial solutions designed to help our clients achieve their financial objectives.
Our
earliest predecessor company, Investors Syndicate, was founded in 1894 to provide face-amount certificates to consumers with a need for conservative investments. By 1937, Investors
Syndicate had expanded its product offerings through Federal Housing Authority mortgages, and later, mutual funds, by establishing Investors Mutual, one of the pioneers in the mutual fund industry. In
1949, Investors Syndicate was renamed Investors Diversified Services,&nbsp;Inc., or IDS. In 1957, IDS added life insurance products, and later, annuity </FONT></P>

through IDS Life Insurance Company (now known as "RiverSource Life Insurance Company"). In 1972, IDS began to expand its distribution network by delivering investment products directly to
clients of unaffiliated financial institutions. IDS also introduced its comprehensive financial planning process to clients, integrating the identification of client needs with the products and
services to address those needs in the 1970's, and it introduced fee-based planning in the 1980's. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
1979, IDS became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alleghany Corporation pursuant to a merger. In 1983, our company was formed as a Delaware corporation in connection with American
Express' 1984 acquisition of IDS Financial Services from Alleghany Corporation. We changed our name to "American Express Financial Corporation" ("AEFC") and began selling our products and services
under the American Express brand in 1994. To provide retail clients with a more comprehensive set of products and services, in the late 1990's we began significantly expanding our offering of mutual
funds of other companies. We continued to expand our investment product offerings in 2002 with the acquisition of our Cambridge, Mass.-based quantitative investment management office and the
establishment of our Boston equity investment management office. In 2003, we acquired Threadneedle Investments. On September&nbsp;30, 2005, American Express consummated a distribution of the shares
of AEFC to American Express shareholders (the "Distribution"), at which time we became an independent, publicly traded company and changed our name to "Ameriprise Financial,&nbsp;Inc." </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with the Distribution, we entered into certain agreements with American Express. The principal agreements consisted of a Separation and Distribution Agreement, a Tax
Allocation Agreement, a Marketing and Branding Agreement, and a Stock Purchase Agreement providing for the
sale of AMEX Assurance Company to American Express. Although the terms of these agreements generally have expired and are no longer operative, certain terms (such as indemnity obligations, cooperation
covenants and obligations to provide information related to contract performance) survive until applicable limitation periods have expired. We believe that we complied with the terms of these
agreements, and we have not been notified of any basis for material indemnity claims. Our separation from American Express is complete. </FONT></P>

flows. We also earn net investment income on owned assets primarily from certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-proprietary
products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our proprietary products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for

client's allocation of savings and investment&#151;as well as products to address these objectives with clients accepting what they determine to be an appropriate range and level of risk. Our
experience has shown that our financial planning relationships with our clients are characterized by an ability to better understand clients' specific needs which enables us to better help our clients
meet those needs, achieve higher overall client satisfaction, have more products held and increase assets under management. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
financial planning clients pay a fixed fee for the receipt of financial planning services. This fee is based on the complexity of a client's financial and life situation and their
advisor's particular practice experience, and is not based on or related to, actual investment performance. If clients elect to implement their financial plan with our company, we and our affiliated
financial advisors generally receive a sales commission and/or sales load and other revenues for the products that we sell to them. These commissions, sales loads and other revenues are separate from
and in addition to financial planning fees we and our affiliated financial advisors may receive. We achieved branded financial planning net cash sales in 2007 of $202&nbsp;million, a 10% increase
over 2006. In addition, sales of financial plans increased in 2007, and approximately 45% of our retail clients have received a financial plan or have entered into an agreement to receive and have
paid for a financial plan. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to purchases of proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds and other securities on a stand-alone basis, clients may purchase mutual
funds, among other securities, in connection with investment advisory fee-based "wrap account" programs or services, and pay fees based on a percentage of their assets. This fee is for the
added services and investment advice associated with these accounts. We currently offer both discretionary and non-discretionary investment advisory wrap accounts. In a discretionary wrap
account, we (or an unaffiliated investment advisor) choose the underlying investments in the portfolio on behalf of the client, whereas in a non-discretionary wrap account, clients choose
the underlying investments in the portfolio based, to the extent the client elects, on the recommendations of their financial advisor. Investors in discretionary and non-discretionary wrap
accounts generally pay an asset-based fee (for advice and other services) that is based on the assets held in their wrap accounts as well as any related fees or costs included in the underlying
securities held in that account (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>e.g.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, underlying mutual fund operating expenses, Rule&nbsp;12b-1 fees, etc.). A portion of our
proprietary mutual fund sales are made through wrap accounts. Client assets held in proprietary mutual funds in a wrap account generally produce higher revenues than client assets held in proprietary
mutual funds on a stand-alone basis because, as noted above, we receive an investment advisory fee based on the asset values of the assets held in a wrap account in addition to revenues we normally
receive for investment management of the funds included in the account. </FONT></P>

Premier is Ameriprise Strategic Portfolio Service Advantage, a non-discretionary wrap account service. The Strategic Portfolio Service Advantage wrap account program had total client
assets under management of $75.1&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2007, compared to $63.5&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2006. We also sponsor separately managed accounts ("SMAs"), a
discretionary wrap account service through which clients invest in strategies offered by us and affiliated and non-affiliated investment managers. SMAs had total client assets under
management of $2.3&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2007, compared to $2.4&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2006. In the first quarter of 2007, we launched </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Active Portfolios</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> investments, a

registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Owners of our certificates invest funds and are entitled to receive, at maturity or at the end of a stated term, a
determinable amount of money equal to their aggregate investments in the certificate plus interest at rates we declare from time to time, less any withdrawals and early withdrawal penalties. For two
types of certificate products, the rate of interest is calculated in whole or in part based on any upward movement in a broad-based stock market index up to a maximum return, where the maximum is a
fixed rate for a given term, but can be changed at our discretion for prospective terms. </FONT></P>

predominantly
provides U.S. domestic products and services, and Threadneedle Investments predominantly provides international investment products and services. U.S. domestic retail products are primarily
distributed through our Advice&nbsp;&amp; Wealth Management segment and also through unaffiliated advisors. International retail products are primarily distributed through third parties. Products
accessed by consumers on a retail basis include mutual funds, variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts, separately managed accounts and collective funds. Asset
Management products are also distributed directly to institutions through an institutional sales force. Institutional asset management products include traditional asset classes separate accounts,
collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds and property funds. Revenues in this segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by both market movements and
net asset flows. This segment earns intersegment revenue for investment management services. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our
Advice&nbsp;&amp; Wealth Management, Annuities and Protection segments. All intersegment activity is eliminated in consolidation. In 2007, 20% of our total revenues from external clients were
attributable to our Asset Management business. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December&nbsp;31, 2007, our Asset Management segment had $286.6&nbsp;billion in managed assets worldwide, compared to $294.3&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2006. Managed
assets include managed external client assets and managed owned assets. Managed external client assets include client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of
the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>RiverSource</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> family of mutual funds, the assets of the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Threadneedle</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> funds and assets of institutional
clients. Managed assets include assets managed by sub-advisors selected by us. These external client assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Managed owned assets
include certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (such as the assets of the general account and the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>RiverSource</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Variable Product funds held in
the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries) for which the Asset Management segment provides management services and recognizes management fees. The assets managed by our Asset Management

have a performance incentive adjustment that adjusts the level of management fees received, upward
or downward, based on the fund's performance as measured against a designated external index of peers. This has a corresponding impact on management fee revenue. In 2007, revenues were adjusted upward
by $2&nbsp;million due to performance incentive adjustments. We earn commissions for distributing the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>RiverSource</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Funds through sales charges
(front-end or back-end loads) on certain classes of shares and distribution and servicing-related (12b-1) fees based on a percentage of fund assets, and receive
intercompany allocation payments. This revenue is impacted by our overall asset levels. We experienced net asset inflows in recent quarters due to strong sales growth resulting from strong investment
performance, new product introductions and effective wholesaling efforts, reversing the experience of significant outflows of prior years. </FONT></P>

registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and offered primarily through banks and other financial institutions to institutional clients such as retirement, pension and
profit-sharing plans. We currently serve as investment manager to 45 collective funds covering a broad spectrum of investment strategies. We receive fees for investment management services that are
generally based upon a percentage of assets under management rather than performance-based fees. We continue to provide our collective funds to retirement plans that were involved in the sale of our
defined contribution recordkeeping business. </FONT></P>

Threadneedle's revenue. Threadneedle provides investment management products and services to Zurich for assets generated by Zurich through the sale of its life insurance products, variable annuity,
pension and general insurance products, as well as other assets on the balance sheet of Zurich. Threadneedle entered into an agreement with Zurich when we acquired Threadneedle Investments in 2003 for
Threadneedle to continue to manage certain assets of Zurich. For investment management of the assets underlying Zurich's U.K. life insurance and pension policyholder products (which represent 87% of
the assets managed for Zurich as of December&nbsp;31, 2007), the initial term of the agreement is through October 2011. For investment management of Zurich's other assets, the initial term ended in
October 2006 and was extended in connection with a restructuring of the portfolio and a move to more market-aligned rates and terms. The agreement also provided for a property fee review in September
2008. Threadneedle also offers its funds directly or within a multi-manager wrap through an independent U.K. distribution platform operated by Openwork Limited. Threadneedle provides sales and

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Annuities segment provides RiverSource Life variable and fixed annuity products to retail clients primarily distributed through our affiliated
financial
advisors and to the retail clients of unaffiliated advisors through third-party distribution. Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account
balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account
balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on owned
assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment
reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>RiverSource</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
Funds under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice&nbsp;&amp; Wealth Management segment, as well as
expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in consolidation. In 2007, 25% of our revenues from external clients were
attributable to our Annuities business. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
offer annuity products issued almost exclusively through the RiverSource Life companies. Our products include deferred variable and fixed annuities, in which assets accumulate until
the contract is surrendered, the contractholder (or in some contracts, annuitant) dies or the contractholder or annuitant begins receiving benefits under an annuity payout option. We also offer
immediate annuities,
in which payments begin within one year of issue and continue for life or for a fixed period of time. In addition to the revenues we generate on these products, which are described below, we also
receive fees charged on assets allocated to our separate accounts to cover administrative costs, and a portion of the management fees from the underlying investment accounts in which assets are
invested, as discussed below under "&#151;Variable Annuities." Investment management performance is critical to the profitability of our </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>RiverSource</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> annuity business as annuity holders have access to
multiple investment options within the annuity. </FONT></P>

result of an increase in variable annuities sales, partially offset by a decline in fixed annuity sales. The relative proportion between fixed and variable annuity sales is generally driven by the
relative performance of the equity and fixed income markets. In times of lackluster performance in equity markets, fixed sales are generally stronger. In times of superior performance in equity
markets, variable sales are generally stronger. The relative proportion between fixed and variable annuity sales is also influenced by product design and other factors. Our recent sales of fixed
annuity products have been substantially limited in response to consumer demand and market conditions. </FONT></P>

Portfolio Navigator asset allocation program is available under our variable annuities. The Portfolio Navigator program is designed to help a contract purchaser select an asset
allocation model portfolio from the choices available under the program, based on the purchaser's stated investment time horizon, risk tolerance and investment goals. We believe the benefits of the
Portfolio Navigator asset allocation program include a well-diversified annuity portfolio, disciplined, professionally created asset allocation models, simplicity and ease of use, access
to multiple well-known money managers within each model portfolio and automatic rebalancing of the client's contract value on a quarterly basis. The model portfolios under the Portfolio
Navigator asset allocation program are designed and periodically updated by our investment management subsidiary, RiverSource Investments, based on recommendations from Morningstar Associates. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contract
purchasers can choose to add various optional benefit provisions to their contracts to meet their needs. These include enhanced guaranteed minimum death benefit provisions,
guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit provisions and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit provisions. We are continually evaluating client needs and developing new variable annuity product
solutions to meet those needs. For example, in 2007 we introduced a new variable annuity feature called </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>SecureSource</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> rider, an updated version of our
optional guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit rider that provides for joint as well as single life coverage. In general, these features can help protect contractholders and beneficiaries from a
shortfall in death or living benefits due to a decline in the value of their underlying investment accounts. </FONT></P>

whole life
and term life, and disability income insurance (we discontinued underwriting new long term care policies as of December&nbsp;31, 2002). Universal life insurance is a form of permanent life insurance
characterized by its flexible premiums, its flexible death benefit amounts and its unbundling of the pricing factors (i.e.,&nbsp;mortality, interest and expenses). Traditional life insurance refers
to whole and term life insurance policies that pay a specified sum to a beneficiary upon death of the insured for a fixed premium. Variable universal life insurance combines
the premium and death benefit flexibility of universal life with underlying fund investment flexibility and the risks associated therewith. </FONT></P>

individual disability income insurance benefits with social security or similar benefit plans and to help them protect their disability income insurance benefits from the risk of inflation. For the
nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2007, we were ranked as the seventh largest provider of individual (non-cancellable) disability income insurance based on premiums (according to

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reinsure a portion of the insurance risks associated with our life, disability income and long term care insurance products through reinsurance
agreements
with unaffiliated reinsurance companies. We use reinsurance in order to limit losses, reduce exposure to large risks and provide additional capacity for future growth. To manage exposure to losses

the terms of the treaties. Our insurance companies remain primarily liable as the direct insurers on all risks reinsured. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally,
we reinsure 90% of the death benefit liability related to individual fixed and variable universal life and term life insurance products. As a result, the RiverSource Life
companies typically retain and are at risk for, at most, 10% of each policy's death benefit from the first dollar of coverage for new sales of these policies, subject to the reinsurer actually paying.
The RiverSource Life
companies began reinsuring risks at this level during 2001 and 2002 for term life insurance and 2002 and 2003 for variable and universal life insurance. Policies issued prior to these dates are not
subject to these reinsurance levels. Generally, the maximum amount of life insurance risk retained by the RiverSource Life companies is $750,000 on any policy insuring a single life and
$1.5&nbsp;million on any flexible premium survivorship variable life policy. For existing long term care policies, RiverSource Life (and RiverSource Life of NY for 1996 and later issues) retained
50% of the risk and ceded on a coinsurance basis the remaining 50% of the risk to a subsidiary of Genworth Financial. Risk on variable life and universal life policies is reinsured on a yearly
renewable term basis. Risk on most term life policies starting in 2001 is reinsured on a coinsurance basis, a type of reinsurance in which the reinsurer participates proportionately in all material
risks and premiums associated with a policy. See Note&nbsp;2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally,
RiverSource Life Insurance Company retains at most $5,000 per month of risk per life on disability income policies sold on policy forms introduced in October, 2007 in most
states and reinsures the remainder of the risk on a coinsurance basis with unaffiliated reinsurance companies. RiverSource Life companies retain all risk for new claims on disability income contracts
sold on other policy forms. Our insurance companies also retain all risk on accidental death benefit claims and substantially all risk associated with waiver of premium provisions. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
also reinsure a portion of the risks associated with our personal auto and home insurance products through two types of reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurance
companies. We purchase reinsurance with a limit of $4.65&nbsp;million per loss and we retain $350,000 per loss. We purchase catastrophe reinsurance and retain $10&nbsp;million of loss per event
with loss recovery up to $80&nbsp;million per event. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We operate in a highly competitive industry. Because we are a diversified financial services firm, we compete directly with a variety of financial
institutions
such as registered investment advisors, securities
brokers, asset managers, banks and insurance companies depending on the type of product and service we are offering. We compete directly with these entities for the provision of products and services
to clients, as well as for our financial advisors and investment management personnel. Our products and services also compete indirectly in the marketplace with the products and services of our
competitors. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
financial advisor force competes for clients with a range of other advisors, broker-dealers and direct channels, including wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, independent

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
acquire and maintain owned, managed and administered assets, we compete against a substantial number of firms, including those of the categories listed above. Our mutual funds, like
other mutual funds, face competition from other mutual fund families and alternative investment products, such as exchange traded funds. Additionally, for mutual funds, high ratings from rating
services, such as Morningstar or Lipper, as well as favorable mention in financial publications, may influence sales and lead to increases in managed assets. As a mutual fund's assets increase,
management fee revenue increases and the fund may achieve economies of scale that make it more attractive to investors because of potential resulting reductions in the fund's expense ratio.
Conversely, low ratings and negative mention in financial publications can lead to outflows, which reduce management fee revenues and can impede achieving the benefits of economies of scale.
Additionally, reputation and brand integrity are becoming increasingly more important as the mutual fund industry generally and certain firms in particular have come under regulatory and media
scrutiny. Our mutual fund products compete against products of firms like Fidelity, American Funds and Oppenheimer. Competitive factors affecting the sale of mutual funds include investment
performance in terms of attaining the stated objectives of </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
banking subsidiary, Ameriprise Bank, is subject to regulation by the OTS, which is the primary regulator of federal savings banks, and by the FDIC in its role as insurer of
Ameriprise Bank's deposits. As its controlling company, we are a savings and loan holding company, and we are subject to supervision by the OTS. Furthermore, our ownership of Threadneedle Investments
subjects us to the EU Financial Conglomerates Directive to designate a global consolidated supervisory regulator, and we have designated the OTS for this purpose. Because of our status as a savings
and loan holding company, our activities are limited to those that are financial in nature, and the OTS has authority to oversee our capital and debt, although there are not specific holding company
capital requirements. Ameriprise Bank is subject to specific capital rules and if its capital falls below certain levels, the OTS is required to take certain remedial actions and may take other
actions, including the imposition of limits on dividends or business activities, and the OTS could direct us to divest the subsidiary. Ameriprise Bank is also subject to limits on capital
distributions, including payment of dividends to us and on transactions with affiliates. In addition, an array of community reinvestment, fair lending, and other consumer protection laws and
regulations apply to Ameriprise Bank. Either of the OTS or the FDIC may bring administrative enforcement actions against Ameriprise Bank or its officers, directors or employees if any of them are
found to be in violation of the law or engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
trust company is primarily regulated by the Minnesota Department of Commerce (Banking Division) and is subject to capital adequacy requirements under Minnesota law. It may not
accept deposits or make personal or commercial loans. As a provider of products and services to tax-qualified retirement plans and IRAs, certain aspects of our business, including the
activities of our trust company, fall within the compliance oversight of the U.S. Departments of Labor and Treasury, particularly the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, commonly referred
to as ERISA, and the tax reporting requirements applicable to such accounts. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Minnesota Department of Commerce (Insurance Division), the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the New York State Insurance Department (the "Domiciliary
Regulators") regulate certain of the RiverSource Life companies, IDS Property Casualty, and Ameriprise Insurance Company depending on each company's state of domicile, which affects both our
Protection and Annuities segments. The New York State Insurance Department regulates RiverSource Life of NY. In addition to being regulated by their Domiciliary Regulators, our RiverSource Life
companies and Property Casualty companies are regulated by each of the insurance regulators in the states where each is authorized to transact the business of insurance. Other states also regulate
such matters as the licensing of sales personnel and, in some cases, the underwriting, marketing and contents of insurance policies and annuity contracts. The primary purpose of such regulation and
supervision is to protect the interests of contractholders and policyholders. Financial regulation of our RiverSource Life companies and Property Casualty companies is extensive, and their financial
and intercompany transactions (such as intercompany dividends, capital contributions and investment activity) are often subject to pre-notification and continuing evaluation by the
Domiciliary Regulators. Virtually all states require participation in insurance guaranty associations which assess fees to insurance companies in order to fund claims of policyholders and
contractholders of insolvent insurance companies. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") defines risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements for insurance companies. The RBC requirements are used by the
NAIC and state insurance regulators to identify companies that merit regulatory actions designed to protect policyholders. Our RiverSource Life companies and Property Casualty companies would be
subject to various levels of regulatory intervention should their total adjusted statutory capital fall below the RBC requirement. At the "company action level," defined as total adjusted capital
level between 100% and 75% of the RBC requirement, an insurer must submit a plan for corrective action with its primary state regulator. The "regulatory action level," which is between 75% and 50% of
the RBC requirement, subjects an insurer to examination, analysis and specific corrective action prescribed by the primary state regulator. If a company's total adjusted capital falls between 50% and
35% of its RBC requirement, referred to as "authorized control level," the insurer's primary state regulator may place the insurer under regulatory control. Insurers with total adjusted capital below
35% of the requirement will be placed under regulatory control. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
the federal level, there is periodic interest in enacting new regulations relating to various aspects of the insurance industry, including taxation of annuities and life insurance
policies, accounting procedures, the use of travel in underwriting, and the treatment of persons differently because of gender with respect to terms, conditions, rates or benefits of an insurance
policy. Adoption of any new federal regulation in any of these or other areas could potentially have an adverse effect upon our RiverSource Life companies. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
businesses may be adversely affected by the current global credit crisis and repricing of credit risk. During the last half of our fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007,
difficulties in the mortgage and broader credit markets in the United States and elsewhere, coupled with the repricing of credit risk,
created extremely difficult market conditions. These conditions resulted in greater volatility, less liquidity, variability of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency. By example, the widening
of credit spreads has significantly impacted certain market-value structured investment vehicles and other structured credit products, which have experienced rapid deterioration in value and/or
failures to meet scheduled payments based on declines in the market value of underlying collateral pools, increased costs or unavailability of credit default hedges or liquidity to their structures,
and/or the triggering of covenants that accelerate the amortization or liquidation of these structures. Each of our segments operates in these markets with exposure for ourselves and our clients in
securities, loans, derivatives, alternative investments, seed capital and other commitments. The difficult and highly volatile conditions in the markets persist. It is difficult to predict how long
these conditions will exist, which of our markets, products and businesses will continue to be directly affected in revenues, management fees and investment valuations and earnings, and to what extent
our clients may seek to bring claims arising out of investment performance. As a result, these factors could materially adversely impact our results of operations. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain
of our insurance and annuity products and certain of our investment and banking products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, and our future costs associated with such
variations may differ from our historical costs. In addition, interest rate fluctuations could result in fluctuations in the valuation of certain minimum guaranteed benefits contained in some of our
variable annuity products. Although we typically hedge against such fluctuations, a significant change in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
periods of increasing market interest rates, we must offer higher crediting rates on interest-sensitive products, such as fixed universal life insurance, fixed annuities,
face-amount certificates and certificates of deposit, and we must increase crediting rates on inforce products to keep these products competitive. Because returns on invested assets may
not increase as quickly as current interest rates, we may have to accept a lower spread and thus lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related
assets. In addition, increases in market interest rates may cause increased policy surrenders, withdrawals from life insurance policies, annuity contracts and certificates of deposit and requests for
policy loans, as policyholders, contractholders and depositors seek to shift assets to products with perceived higher returns. This process may lead to an earlier than expected flow of cash out of our
business. Also, increases in market interest rates may result in extension of certain cash flows from structured mortgage assets. These withdrawals and surrenders may require investment assets to be
sold at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in market interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. Increases in crediting rates, as well as
surrenders and withdrawals, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. An increase in surrenders and withdrawals also may require us to accelerate amortization
of deferred acquisition costs or other intangibles or cause an impairment of goodwill, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net earnings. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
periods of falling interest rates, our "spread," or the difference between the returns we earn on the investments that support our obligations under these products and the
amounts that we must pay policyholders, contractholders and depositors, may be reduced or could become negative, primarily because some of these products have guaranteed minimum crediting rates. Due
to the long-term nature of the liabilities associated with certain of our businesses, such as fixed annuities and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in
long-term interest rates may subject us to reinvestment risks and increased hedging costs. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest
rate fluctuations also could have an adverse effect on the results of our investment portfolio. During periods of declining market interest rates, the interest we receive on
variable interest rate investments decreases. In addition, during those periods, we are forced to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower-yielding
high-grade instruments or in lower-credit instruments to maintain comparable returns. Issuers of certain callable fixed income securities also may decide to prepay their obligations in
order to borrow at lower market rates, which increases the risk that we may have to invest the cash proceeds of these securities in lower-yielding or lower-credit instruments. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant
downturns and volatility in equity markets could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Market downturns and volatility may cause
potential new purchasers of our products to refrain from purchasing products, such as mutual funds, variable annuities and variable universal life insurance, which have returns linked to the
performance of the equity markets. Downturns may also cause current shareholders in our mutual funds and contractholders in our annuity and protection products to withdraw cash values from those
products. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
downturns and volatility in equity markets can have an adverse effect on the revenues and returns from our asset management services, wrap accounts, and variable annuity
contracts. Because the profitability of these products and services depends on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, declines in the equity markets will reduce our revenues
because the value of the investment assets we manage will be reduced. In addition, some of our variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum death benefits and guaranteed minimum withdrawal and
accumulation benefits. A significant equity market decline, or volatility in equity markets, could result in guaranteed minimum benefits being higher than what current account values would support,
thus producing a loss as we pay the benefits, having an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we have hedged a portion of the guarantees for the variable
annuity contracts in order to mitigate the financial loss of equity market declines or volatility, there can be no assurance that such a decline or volatility would not materially impact the
profitability of certain products or product lines or our financial condition or results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that investment performance is an important factor in the growth of many of our businesses. Poor investment performance could impair our revenues and earnings, as well as our
prospects for growth. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from investment management agreements with the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>RiverSource</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> family of mutual funds
that are terminable on 60&nbsp;days' notice. In addition, although some contracts governing investment management services are subject to termination for failure to meet performance benchmarks,
institutional and individual clients can generally terminate their relationships with us or our financial advisors at will or on relatively short notice. Our clients can also reduce the aggregate
amount of managed assets or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures, for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest
rates, changes in investment preferences, changes in our (or our financial advisors') reputation in the marketplace, changes in client management or ownership, loss of key investment
management personnel and financial market performance. A reduction in managed assets, and the associated decrease in revenues and earnings, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Moreover, certain money market funds we advise carry net asset protection mechanisms which can be triggered by a decline in market value of underlying portfolio assets; this could cause us to make a
capital contribution to the funds without consideration, which would result in a loss. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, during periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions, the level of individual investor participation in the global markets may also decrease, which would negatively
impact the results of our retail businesses. Fluctuations in global market activity could impact the flow of investment capital into or from assets under management and the way customers allocate
capital among </FONT></P>

periods of unfavorable economic conditions, unemployment rates often increase, which can result in higher loan delinquency and default rates, and this can have a negative impact on our banking
business. Uncertain economic conditions and heightened market volatility may also increase the likelihood that clients or regulators present or threaten legal claims, that regulators may increase the

assets
had ratings below investment-grade. Moreover, economic downturns and corporate malfeasance can increase the number of companies, including those with investment-grade ratings, that default on their
debt obligations. Default-related declines in the value of our fixed income securities portfolio or consumer credit products could cause our net earnings to decline and could also cause us to
contribute capital to some of our regulated subsidiaries, which may require us to obtain funding during periods of unfavorable market conditions. Higher delinquency and default rates in our bank's

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use reinsurance to mitigate our risks in various circumstances as described in Item&nbsp;1 of this Annual Report on
Form&nbsp;10-K&#151;"Business&#151;Our Segments&#151;Protection&#151;Reinsurance." Reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our
policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. Accordingly, we bear credit and performance risk with respect to our reinsurers. A reinsurer's insolvency or its inability or unwillingness to
make payments under the terms of our reinsurance agreement could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations that could be material. See Note&nbsp;2 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, we use a variety of derivative instruments (including options, forwards, and interest rate and currency swaps) with a number of counterparties to hedge several business
risks. The amount and breadth of exposure to derivative counterparties has increased significantly in connection with our strategies to hedge guaranteed benefit obligations under our variable annuity
products. If our counterparties fail to honor in a timely manner their obligations under the derivative instruments, our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective. That failure could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. This risk of failure of our hedge transactions may be increased by capital market volatility, such as the volatility that

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our businesses operate in intensely competitive industry segments. We compete based on a number of factors including name recognition, service, the
quality of
investment advice, investment performance, product features, price, perceived financial strength, and claims-paying and credit ratings. Our competitors include broker-dealers, banks, asset managers,
insurers and other financial institutions. Many of our businesses face competitors that have greater market share, offer a broader range of products, have greater financial resources, or have higher
claims-paying or credit ratings than we do. Some of our competitors may possess or acquire intellectual property rights that could provide a competitive advantage to them in certain markets or for
certain products, which could make it more difficult for us to introduce new products and services. Some of our competitors' proprietary products or technology could be similar to our own, and this
could result in disputes that could impact our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, over time certain sectors of the financial services industry have become considerably more
concentrated, as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. This convergence could result in our competitors gaining
greater resources and we may experience pressures on our pricing and market share as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices. </FONT></P>

and a commensurate drop in profits as sales of other companies' mutual funds are less profitable than those from our own mutual funds. A decline in investment performance could also adversely affect
the realization of benefits from investments in our strategy to expand alternative distribution channels for our own products, including third-party distribution of our mutual funds. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We operate in highly regulated industries, and are required to obtain and maintain licenses for many of the businesses we operate in addition to being
subject to
regulatory oversight. Securities regulators have significantly increased the level of regulation in recent years and have several outstanding proposals for additional regulation. Significant
discussion and activity by regulators concerns the sale and suitability of financial products and services to persons planning for retirement, as well as to older investors. In addition, we are
subject to heightened requirements and associated costs and risks relating to privacy and the protection of customer data. Our information systems, moreover, may be subject to increased efforts of
"hackers" by reason of the customer data we possess. These requirements, costs and risks, as well as possible legislative or regulatory changes, may constrain our ability to market our products and
services to our target demographic and potential customers, and could negatively affect our profitability and make it more difficult for us to pursue our growth strategy. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
insurance companies are subject to state regulation, so must comply with statutory reserve and capital requirements. State regulators are continually reviewing and updating these
requirements and other requirements relating to the business operations of insurance companies, including their underwriting and sales practices. Moreover, our life insurance companies are subject to
capital requirements for variable annuity contracts with guaranteed death or living benefits. These requirements may have an impact on future statutory reserves and regulatory capital in the event
equity market values fall in the future. Moreover, there is active discussion at the NAIC of moving to a principles-based reserving system. This could change statutory reserve requirements
significantly, and it is not possible to estimate the impact at this time. Further, we cannot predict the effect that proposed federal legislation, such as the option of federally chartered insurers,
may have on our insurance businesses or their competitors. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance
with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive. Moreover, the evaluation of our compliance with broker-dealer, investment advisor, insurance
company and banking regulation by the SEC, OTS and other regulatory organizations is an ongoing feature of our business, the outcomes of which may not be foreseeable. Changes in these laws and
regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business. Our financial advisors may decide that the direct cost of compliance and the indirect cost
of time spent on compliance matters outweigh the benefits of a career as a financial advisor, which could lead to financial advisor attrition. The costs of the compliance requirements we face, and the
constraints they impose on our operations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. </FONT></P>

client. We have procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address conflicts of interest. However, identifying and appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and our
reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, the SEC and other federal and state regulators have increased their scrutiny
of potential conflicts of interest. It is possible that potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions. It is possible also that the regulatory scrutiny of, and

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We establish reserves as estimates of our liabilities to provide for future obligations under our insurance policies, annuities and investment
certificate
contracts. We also establish reserves as estimates of the potential for loan losses in our consumer lending portfolios. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation, but rather are estimates of
contract benefits or loan losses and related expenses we expect to incur over time. The assumptions and estimates we make in establishing reserves require certain judgments about future experience
and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. We cannot determine with precision the actual amounts that it will pay for contract benefits, the timing of payments, or whether the assets supporting its
stated reserves will increase to the levels it estimates before payment of benefits or claims We monitor our reserve levels continually. If we were to conclude that our reserves are insufficient to
cover actual or expected contract benefits or loan collections, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination,
which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For more information on how we set our reserves, see Note&nbsp;2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in
our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We set prices for </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>RiverSource</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> life insurance and some annuity products based upon expected claim
payment
patterns, derived from assumptions we make about the morbidity rates, or likelihood of sickness, and mortality rates, or likelihood of death, of our policyholders and contractholders. The
long-term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing assumptions. For example, if morbidity rates are higher, or mortality rates are
lower, than our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments under disability income insurance policies and immediate annuity contracts than we had projected. The same holds true
for long term care policies we previously underwrote to the extent of the risks that we have retained. If mortality rates are higher than our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make greater
payments under our life insurance policies and annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum death benefits than we had projected. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
risk that our claims experience may differ significantly from our pricing assumptions is particularly significant for our long term care insurance products notwithstanding our
ability to implement future price increases. As with life insurance, long term care insurance policies provide for long-duration coverage and, therefore, our actual claims experience will
emerge over many years. However, as a relatively new product in the market, long term care insurance does not have the extensive claims experience history of life insurance, and, as a result, our
ability to forecast future claim rates for long term care insurance is more limited than for life insurance. We have sought to moderate these uncertainties to some extent by partially reinsuring long
term care policies we previously underwrote and by limiting our present long term care insurance offerings to policies underwritten fully by an unaffiliated third party, and we have also implemented
rate increases on certain inforce policies as described in Item&nbsp;1 of this Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K&#151;"Business&#151;Our

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prices and expected future profitability of our life insurance and deferred annuity products are based in part upon assumptions related to
persistency, which
is the probability that a policy or contract will remain inforce from one period to the next. The effect of persistency on profitability varies for different products. For most of our life insurance
and deferred annuity products, actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability, especially in the early years of a policy or contract,
primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
our long term care insurance, actual persistency that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability. If these policies remain inforce
longer than we assumed, then we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we had anticipated when we priced or partially reinsured these products. Some of our long term care insurance
policies have experienced higher persistency and poorer loss experience than we had assumed, which led us to increase premium rates on certain of these policies. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
our assumptions regarding persistency experience are inherently uncertain, reserves for future policy benefits and claims may prove to be inadequate if actual persistency
experience is different from those assumptions. Although some of our products permit us to increase premiums during the life of the policy or contract, we cannot guarantee that these increases would
be sufficient to maintain profitability. Additionally, some of these pricing changes require regulatory approval, which may not be forthcoming. Moreover, many of our products do not permit us to
increase premiums or limit those
increases during the life of the policy or contract, while premiums on certain other products (primarily long term care insurance) may not be increased without prior regulatory approval. Significant
deviations in experience from pricing expectations regarding persistency could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred acquisition costs ("DAC") represent the costs of acquiring new business, principally direct sales commissions and other distribution and
underwriting
costs that have been deferred on the sale of annuity, life and disability income insurance and, to a lesser extent, marketing and promotional expenses for personal auto and home insurance, and
distribution expense for certain mutual fund products. For annuity and universal life products, DAC are amortized based on projections of estimated gross profits over amortization periods equal to the
approximate life of the business. For other insurance products, DAC are generally amortized as a percentage of premiums over amortization periods equal to the premium-paying period. For certain mutual
fund products, we generally amortize DAC over fixed periods on a straight-line basis. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our

what our models indicate. This could cause us to incur investment losses or cause our hedging and other risk management strategies to be ineffective. Other risk management methods depend upon the
evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us, which may not always be accurate, complete,

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We operate our business from two principal locations, both of which are located in Minneapolis, Minnesota: the Ameriprise Financial Center, an 897,280
square
foot building that we lease, and our 903,722 square foot Client Service Center, which we own. Our lease term for the Ameriprise Financial Center began in November 2000 and is for 20&nbsp;years, with
several options to extend the term. Our aggregate annual rent for the Ameriprise Financial Center is $15&nbsp;million. We also own the 170,815 square foot Oak Ridge Conference Center, a training
facility and conference center in Chaska, Minnesota, which can also serve as a disaster recovery site if necessary. We also lease space in an operations center located in Minneapolis, and we occupy
space in a second operations center located in Phoenix, Arizona. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
property and casualty subsidiary, IDS Property Casualty, leases its corporate headquarters in DePere, Wisconsin, a suburb of Green Bay. In December 2004, it entered into a
sale-and-leaseback agreement with Inland Real Estate Acquisitions,&nbsp;Inc., and sold that property for $18&nbsp;million. Under the terms of the agreement, Inland leased
the property back to IDS Property Casualty for a ten-year term with an option to renew the lease for up to six renewal terms of five years each. The lease is a net lease, which means our
subsidiary is responsible for all costs and expenses relating to the property in addition to annual rent. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAI
leases its corporate headquarters, containing approximately 88,000 square feet, in LaVista, Nebraska, under a lease that runs through January&nbsp;31, 2018 with renewal options.
SAI also maintains data centers and disaster recovery facilities in Omaha, Nebraska and Kansas City, Missouri. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threadneedle
leases two office facilities in London, England and also one in Swindon, England. It is the sole tenant of its principal headquarters office, a 60,410 square foot building,
under a lease expiring in June 2018. Threadneedle also leases part of a building in Frankfurt, Germany and rents offices in a number of other European cities to support its non-U.K.
operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally,
we lease the premises we occupy in other locations, including the executive and bank offices that we maintain in New York City and branch offices for our employee branded
advisors throughout the United States. We believe that the facilities owned or occupied by our company suit our needs and are well maintained. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in the normal course of business in legal, regulatory and arbitration proceedings, including class
actions,
concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of its activities as a diversified financial services firm. These include proceedings specific to the Company as well as proceedings generally
applicable to business practices in the industries in which it operates. The Company can also be subject to litigation arising out of its general business activities, such as its investments,
contracts, leases and employment relationships. Uncertain economic conditions and heightened volatility in the financial markets, such as those which have been experienced particularly since the
summer of 2007, may increase the likelihood that clients and other persons or regulators may present or threaten legal claims or that regulators increase the scope or frequency of examinations of us
or the financial services industry generally. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
with other financial services firms, the level of regulatory activity and inquiry concerning our businesses remains elevated. From time to time, we receive requests for information
from, and have been subject to examination by, the SEC, FINRA (then known as the National Association of Securities Dealers), OTS, state insurance regulators, state attorneys general and various other
governmental and quasi-governmental authorities concerning our business activities and practices, including: sales and product or service features of, or disclosures pertaining to, financial plans,
our mutual funds, annuities, insurance products and brokerage services; non-cash compensation paid to our field leaders and financial advisors; supervision of our financial advisors; and
sales of, or brokerage or revenue sharing practices relating to, other companies' real estate investment trust ("REIT") shares, mutual fund shares or other investment products. Other open matters
relate, among other things, to the administration of death claims to multiple beneficiaries under our variable annuities, the portability (or network transferability) of our </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>RiverSource</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> mutual funds,
supervisory practices in connection with financial advisors' outside business activities, sales practices associated with the
sale of fixed and variable annuities, the suitability of product recommendations made to retail financial planning clients and the delivery of financial plans, and the suitability of particular
trading strategies. The number of reviews and investigations has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry, including Ameriprise. We have cooperated and
will continue to cooperate with the applicable regulators regarding their inquiries. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These
legal and regulatory proceedings are subject to uncertainties and, as such, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may result. An adverse outcome in one
or more of these proceedings could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other relief that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or
results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain
legal and regulatory proceedings are described below. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
June 2004, an action captioned John E. Gallus et al. v. American Express Financial Corp. and American Express Financial Advisors&nbsp;Inc., was filed in the United States District
Court for the District of Arizona, and was later transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged that they were investors in several of our mutual
funds and they purported to bring the action derivatively on behalf of those funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The plaintiffs alleged that fees allegedly paid to the defendants by the
funds for investment advisory and administrative services were excessive. On July&nbsp;6, 2007, the Court granted our motion for summary judgment, dismissing all claims with prejudice. Plaintiffs
have appealed the Court's decision. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
March 2006, a lawsuit captioned Good, et al. v. Ameriprise Financial,&nbsp;Inc., et al. (Case No.&nbsp;00-cv-01027) was filed in the United States
District Court for the District of Minnesota. The lawsuit had been brought as a putative class action and plaintiffs purported to represent all of our </FONT></P>

who sold shares of REITs and tax credit limited partnerships between March 2000 and March 2006. Plaintiffs sought unspecified compensatory and restitutionary damages as well as injunctive
relief, alleging that we incorrectly calculated commissions owed advisors for the sale of these products. On January&nbsp;18, 2008, the Court denied plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The
Court requested supplemental briefs addressing whether the Court continues to have subject-matter jurisdiction over the two individual plaintiffs' claims. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
previously reported two adverse arbitration awards issued in 2006 by FINRA panels against SAI and former registered representatives of SAI. Those arbitrations involved customer
claims relating to suitability, disclosures, supervision and certain other sales practices. Other clients of those former registered representatives have presented similar claims. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
October 2007, the State of New Hampshire commenced an action against us captioned, "In the Matter of Ameriprise Financial,&nbsp;Inc., Ameriprise Financial
Services,&nbsp;Inc.&nbsp;&amp; Larry Post." The action includes claims of New Hampshire statutory violations related to the alleged failure to deliver financial plans sold to clients, instances of
forgery and failure to supervise. The parties have agreed to stay the action while discussing possible resolution. </FONT></P>

accompanying Condensed Financial Statements include the accounts of Ameriprise Financial,&nbsp;Inc. (the "Registrant," "Ameriprise Financial" or "Parent Company") and, on an equity basis, its
subsidiaries and affiliates. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and all adjustments made were of a normal, recurring
nature. The financial information of the Parent Company should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes of Ameriprise Financial. Parent Company revenues and

Financial was formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of American Express Company ("American Express"). On February&nbsp;1, 2005, the American Express Board of Directors announced its
intention to pursue the disposition of 100% of its shareholdings in Ameriprise Financial (the "Separation") through a tax-free distribution to American Express shareholders. In preparation
for the disposition, Ameriprise Financial approved a stock split of its 100 common shares entirely held by American Express into 246&nbsp;million common shares. Effective as of the close of business
on September&nbsp;30, 2005, American Express completed the separation of Ameriprise Financial and the distribution of the Ameriprise Financial common shares to American Express shareholders (the
"Distribution"). The Distribution was effectuated through a pro-rata dividend to American Express shareholders consisting of one share of Ameriprise Financial common stock for every 5
shares of American Express common stock owned by its shareholders on September&nbsp;19, 2005, the record date. Prior to August&nbsp;1, 2005, Ameriprise Financial was named American Express
Financial Corporation. </FONT></P>
