<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overview of Our Business</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>We are a leading producer of ion implantation, dry strip and
photostabilization equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors in the United
States, Europe and Asia Pacific. We have recently introduced rapid thermal processing
equipment, which is used in semiconductor manufacturing primarily before and after the
ion implantation process.  In addition, we provide extensive aftermarket service and
support, including spare parts, equipment upgrades, maintenance services and customer
training. We have a 50-50 joint venture with Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd. in Japan.
This joint venture, which is known as Sumitomo Eaton Nova Corporation, or SEN, licenses
technology from us for ion implantation, has exclusive rights to the territory of Japan
and is the leading producer of ion implantation equipment in Japan.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <B>Industry Overview</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>Semiconductors are used in personal computers, telecommunication equipment,
digital consumer electronics, wireless communication products and other applications.
Most semiconductors are built on a wafer of silicon.  The transistor formation process
creates the electrically active junction for the semiconductor within the silicon wafer,
and those junctions create, typically, either transistors or capacitors. Later, metal
interconnections are formed on top of the silicon that connect the transistor or
capacitor components.</P>

<P>Semiconductor manufacturers seek efficiency improvements through increased equipment
utilization, higher manufacturing yields, the addition of manufacturing equipment in existing
fabrication facilities and the construction of new fabrication facilities. During the period
from early 1999 through 2000, semiconductor manufacturers met the increased demand for chips
mostly by building new fabrication facilities, and by making additional equipment purchases
to expand existing fabrication facilities.</P>

<P>Periodically, and historically every seven or eight years, the semiconductor industry
adopts a larger wafer size to achieve greater economics. By increasing the wafer size,
semiconductor manufacturers can produce more chips per wafer, thus reducing the overall
manufacturing cost per chip. The more advanced wafer fabrication facilities are currently
using wafers with a diameter of 200 millimeters. Currently, the industry has started a
transition to 300 millimeter wafers. Some semiconductor manufacturers have launched pilot
and production lines using 300 millimeter wafers. It is anticipated that additional manufacturers
will add new 300 millimeter production capabilities over the next two to five years, which
will lead to increased demand for equipment with 300 millimeter equipment.</P>

<P>Given the magnitude of the investment needed to build a new fabrication facility,
which today exceeds $1 billion, and the very large volume of product each fab can produce,
independent semiconductor manufacturers, or foundries, have emerged to serve semiconductor
producers who design but do not manufacture chips and are typically smaller companies. In
addition, foundries manufacture semiconductors for large producers who choose to outsource
part of their demand. Foundries, which are predominantly located in Taiwan and Singapore,
have become significant purchasers of semiconductor equipment. </P>


<B><P>Ion Implantation Systems</P>
</B>
<P>Ion implantation is a principal step in the manufacturing process for semiconductors.
An ion implanter is a large, technically advanced machine that injects charged ions, or
dopants, such as arsenic, boron or phosphorus, into a silicon wafer through an accurately
controlled electric field, with a precisely defined amount of energy ranging between several
hundred and three million volts. Certain areas of the silicon wafer are blocked off by a
material known as photoresist so that the dopants will only enter the wafer where needed.
The dopants change the electrical properties of the silicon wafer to create the active
components of a chip. The amount of energy determines the depth to which the dopant penetrates
the wafer, and the amount of dopant or dose determines how much the electrical properties of
the silicon wafer are changed.</P>

<P>There are three types of ion implantation machines: high energy, high current and high
tilt/medium current. Each type injects ions either at greater density, creating more ions per
area (such as in high current tools), or with more energy, driving the ions deeper into the
silicon  (such as in high energy tools). Typically, a wafer will receive from 10 to up to 35
ion implants as it is manufactured, depending on the complexity of the device. The industry
trend is to design and build more complex, highly integrated chips which require more implants
to create. We have designed our products to enhance the manufacturers' flexibility in combining
machines during the implant process.</P>

<P>A high energy implanter is typically used to implant dopant deep in the wafer, which
allows improved isolation of adjoining circuits on the same chip. As a result, in recent years
the use of high energy implanters has expanded into the manufacture of virtually all types of
chips. They are used in the manufacture of smaller, more complex chips, such as those used in
cellular phones and other hand held devices because they enable more functionality with less
power consumption. They are also increasingly used in the manufacture of chips that are used
in personal computers because they permit greater computing power from a chip of a given size.</P>

<P>For implants that require high dose and medium to very shallow depth, a high current
implanter is most often used. In some applications, very shallow, high-dose implants result
in faster chips, an important feature for microprocessors, digital signal processors and other chips. </P>

<P>Most ion implant steps occur with the ion beam perpendicular to the wafer.  A high
tilt/medium current implanter, however, is primarily used for the implant step that requires
the ion beam to be positioned at an angle to the wafer to implant dopants below preexisting
features. The use of the high tilt/medium current implanter extends into some high energy
applications to allow customers greater flexibility in selecting the most optimal combination
of implanters for their needs.</P>

<P>We manufacture a complete line of high energy, high current and high tilt/medium current
implanters.  The following chart lists our principal products:</P>

<P>Our implanters have been designed with a process overlap that allows customers to tailor the
combination of high energy, high current and high tilt/medium current implanters to their specific
needs. High energy and high current implanters can be used to cover most high tilt/medium current
applications, and the high tilt/medium current implanter can be used for some high energy applications.
All of our ion implantation systems share certain of the same modular subsystems for efficiency and
convenience. The subsystems for wafer handling robot, ion source, vacuum system and operator interface
are common among our three implanters. This common platform reduces our design and production time and
costs, and overall cost of ownership for our customers by minimizing training, spare parts inventory
and maintenance.</P>

<P>Our GSD/HE product is the industry's only ion implantation product to be rated "best product"
and was the "Grand Award" winner among semiconductor capital equipment products, an award sponsored
by Semiconductor International, an industry publication.</P>

<P>We have recently introduced our LED implanter, which extends the energy range of our GSD/200E(2)
implanter to lower energies than can be achieved with traditional high current implanters. These machines
respond to the demand for high dose, ultra shallow implants that increase chip speed at acceptable
machine throughput rates.</P>

<P>Our high tilt/medium current ion implanter complements our high energy and high current
implanters. Our 8250HT targets high tilt applications that cannot be performed with high energy
or high current implanters and extends into some high energy applications to allow customers a
flexible combination of implanters. We target our 8250HT high tilt/medium current machine for
the relatively few steps that our high energy and high current machines cannot complete. The
most important step is an angular implant designed to insert dopants below preexisting features
on the wafer. Our recently introduced MC3 high tilt/medium current implanter is designed to process
300 millimeter wafers.</P>

<P>During the past three years, we have also produced a small number of ion implanters used
in the production of laptop computer screens and other flat panel displays. </P>

<B><P>Surface Preparation Products</P>

<P><I>Dry Strip and Photostabilization Systems</I>. </B> We entered the dry strip and
photostabilization product markets through our acquisition of Fusion Systems, Inc. in August
1997.  Fusion pioneered the development of photostabilization in 1983.  In the process steps
prior to ion implantation, a light sensitive, polymer-based liquid, called photoresist, is
spread in a uniformly thin film on the wafer.  Photostabilization uses ultraviolet light
to harden the photoresist in order to provide better performance for the subsequent implant
step. After the implant step, the used photoresist must be removed. The primary means of
removing excess photoresist and residue is called dry strip. Our dry strip machines, often
called ashers, use microwave energy to turn process gases into plasma, which then acts on
the surface of the wafer to remove the photoresist and unwanted residue. Dry strip and
photostabilization are also used for surface preparation processes throughout the wafer fab.</P>

</pre>



<FONT SIZE=2><P>Our FusionGemini dual chamber platform is the foundation for both our dry
strip and our photostabilizer products. Fusion pioneered photostabilization technology, and
we believe that our products remain the industry standard. Our dry strip tools are capable
of removing bulk photoresist from the wafer, as well as the residue left behind after bulk
strip. This reduces or eliminates the need for further wet chemical stripping by eliminating
the use of hazardous chemicals traditionally used for this step. Manufacturing cost is further
reduced by the fact that our ashers do not require side access, conserving expensive cleanroom
space. Our Fusion ES3 dry strip product, a 300 millimeter dry strip machine, was tested by
Sematech, an industry association of semiconductor manufacturers, and met Sematech's 300 millimeter
requirements. Satisfaction of Sematech's standard requirements indicates that our Fusion ES3 product
has achieved a level of performance required by many semiconductor manufacturers.</P>

<P>Our photostabilizers are used by a majority of integrated circuit manufacturers worldwide
because of our proprietary ultraviolet light source and the high throughput of the FusionGemini
dual chamber platform. Our recently introduced Fusion PS3 machine has 300 millimeter wafer
capability and we believe that it is the only 300 millimeter production-ready photostabilizer
available on the market. It has been installed in 300 millimeter pilot production facilities.</P>

<B><P><I>Rapid Thermal Processing Systems.</I>  </B>We introduced our rapid thermal processing
products in 1999.  At a number of points during the manufacturing process, silicon wafers need to
be heated rapidly, often to 900 degrees centigrade or higher, in order to complete chemical or
electronic reactions. This heating process is referred to as rapid thermal processing, or RTP.</P>

<P>Our RTP machine employs a patented design to process a single wafer in a hot wall vertical
reactor. The reactor has three zones that are heated by heating coils, as well as an actively
cooled base, which create a uniform temperature gradient from top to bottom. The resulting stable
temperature profile is inherently repeatable, accurate and reliable. Rapid heating and cooling of
the wafer is achieved by simply adjusting the vertical position of the wafer within the reactor.
Most other RTP equipment manufacturers use more expensive lamp-based RTP systems, which require
frequent lamp replacement and require expensive control systems. For this reason, we believe our
RTP machines have lower overall operating costs than these lamp-based systems.</P>

<P>&#9;The following chart lists our principal RTP products:</P></FONT>

<B><P><I>Post Sales Support and Services.</I>  </B>We offer our customers extensive post sales
service and support throughout the lifecycle of the equipment we manufacture. We believe that more
than 3,200 of our products, including products shipped by SEN, are in use worldwide. The service
and support that we provide include spare parts, equipment upgrades, maintenance services and
customer training. We offer service at 66 locations in ten countries; 13 of these are combined
sales and service offices, and the balance are service-only offices, mostly located in our principal
customers' fabrication facilities.</P>

<P>Our customer support network includes over 500 sales and marketing personnel and service
engineers, including field service engineers, spare parts support staff and applications engineers.
An additional 300 persons located at our three manufacturing facilities work with our customers
to provide advanced equipment support, applications support, customer training and documentation.  </P>

<P>Most of our customers maintain spare parts inventories for our machines. In 1997, we launched
a web-based spare parts management and replenishment tracking program, or SMART, to facilitate internet
communication and e-commerce with our customers. The implementation of our SMART program has helped us
to achieve reduced order fulfillment costs and cycle times resulting in an expanded customer base for
this service offering .</P>

<P>Our process technology center in Beverly, Massachusetts is available to customers for developing
and testing advanced ion implantation and RTP processes, and our process technology center in Rockville,
Maryland is available to customers for developing and testing dry strip and photostabilization processes.
At these facilities, we also make available to our customers advanced testing and analysis equipment. In
addition, we are constructing a 140,000 square foot addition to the Beverly facility, which will house
an advanced process development, product demonstration and customer training center for all of the equipment
we produce.</P>

<P>The ability to provide prompt and effective field support is critical to our sales efforts, due
to the substantial operational and financial commitments made by customers that purchase our systems.
Our customer support programs, combined with our research and development efforts, have served to
encourage use of our systems in production applications and have accelerated penetration of certain
key accounts.</P>

<B><P>Sales and Marketing</P>

</B><P>We primarily sell our equipment and services through our direct sales force. We have 13
sales offices in seven countries.  Aftermarket service and support is also offered at all of these
offices. In the United States, we conduct sales and marketing activities from seven locations.
Outside of the United States, our sales offices are located in Taiwan, South Korea, Germany, Singapore,
Italy and France. In addition, isolated sales are made in smaller markets through distributors and
manufacturers representatives.  We have over 500 sales and marketing personnel and service engineers.
Our sales objective is to work closely with customers to secure purchase orders for multiple systems
as they expand existing facilities and build new wafer facilities. We believe that our marketing efforts
are enhanced by the technical expertise of our research and development personnel. </P>

<P>In Japan, we market our products through two channels: one, we sell our ion implant products only
through our SEN joint venture, which sells its machines and services directly to semiconductor fabricators;
and two, we sell our photostabilizers, dry strip and rapid thermal processing products to semiconductor
fabricators through an exclusive distribution agreement with Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd. entered into
in 1999. The distribution agreement also provides for the parties to discuss the manufacture and sale of
these products through SEN if the parties agree that sales volume will justify manufacturing these products
in Japan in the future. The distribution arrangement expires in 2002 and thereafter is renewable from year
to year, unless either party has given the other party six months prior written notice.</P>

<P>International sales, including export sales from our U.S. manufacturing facilities to foreign
customers and sales by our foreign subsidiaries and branches, accounted for 69.4% of total net sales
in 2000, 53.5% of total net sales in 1999, and 49.4% in 1998. Substantially all of our sales are
denominated in U.S. dollars. SEN's sales are denominated in Japanese yen.</P>

<B><P>Customers</P>

</B><P>In 2000, the top 20 semiconductor manufacturers accounted for approximately 79% of total
semiconductor industry capital spending. These manufacturers are from the four largest semiconductor
manufacturing regions in the world: the United States, Asia Pacific (Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore),
Japan and Europe. We and SEN serve all of the 20 largest semiconductor manufacturers. We believe that
more than 3,200 of our products, including products shipped by SEN, are in use worldwide.</P>

<P>Net sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 56.3%, 59.1% and 37.6% of net sales,
respectively, in 2000, 1999 and 1998. We expect that sales of our products to relatively few customers
will continue to account for a high percentage of net sales for the foreseeable future. In 2000, net
sales to STMicroelectronics N.V., accounted for 13.9%, of our net sales. No other customer accounted
for as much as 10% of our net sales in 2000. In 1999, net sales to STMicroelectronics N.V., Motorola,
Inc and Texas Instruments Incorporated accounted for 15.9%, 10.6% and 10.5%, respectively, of our net
sales.  In 1998, no single customer accounted for as much as 9.0% of our net sales.</P>

<B><P>SEN Joint Venture</P>

</B><P>In 1982, we established our SEN joint venture with Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd. to
provide us with additional manufacturing capacity for our ion implant products and local access to
the Japanese semiconductor equipment market. Under our arrangements with Sumitomo Heavy Industries,
Ltd., our ion implant products may be sold in Japan only through the joint venture. SEN may sell its
products outside Japan only with our consent and through us as exclusive distributor. There are
isolated sales of our equipment into Japan to our non-Japanese customers and isolated sales of SEN
equipment outside of Japan primarily to its Japanese customers and their joint ventures.  SEN
manufactures ion implantation equipment at its Toyo, Japan location under the license from us described
below. From time to time, we sell ion implantation equipment and other products to SEN.  In 2000, our
net sales of products to SEN amounted to $11.9 million.</P>

<P>As part of the joint venture arrangement, we have entered into a separate license agreement
with SEN, last renewed in 1996, under which we have granted SEN an exclusive license in Japan to
use our current and future ion implantation technology and to manufacture, use and sell products
using our current and future ion implantation patents. We have also granted SEN a non-exclusive
license to sell ion implantation products outside of Japan. We received royalty income from SEN
under the license agreement of $13.5 million in 2000, $3.8 million in 1999, and $4.0 million in
1998. The license agreement expires on December 31, 2004 and is automatically renewable for
successive five year periods unless either party has provided one year's prior notice of termination.</P>

<P>SEN has the right to use the name "EATON" as part of its corporate name under a corporate
name agreement with Eaton that has been assigned to us. We have the right, however, to terminate
that agreement at any time upon 60 days' notice and we are obligated under our trademark license
agreement with Eaton to terminate the corporate name agreement on December 31, 2004. SEN also has
the right to use in Japan the trademarks "EATON" and "NOVA" on its ion implantation products under
SEN's separate trademark license agreement with Eaton that also has been assigned to us. SEN does
not, however, have the right to use "EATON" in logo format. The SEN trademark license agreement
requires SEN to pay us semiannual royalties equal to 0.5% of net sales. SEN must maintain quality
and reliability standards, and we are entitled to terminate our trademark agreement with SEN at
any time for cause and we are obligated under our trademark license agreement with Eaton to terminate
the SEN trademark license agreement on December 31, 2004.</P>

<P> <B>Research and Development</P>

</B><P>Our industry continues to experience rapid technological change, requiring us to
frequently introduce new products and enhancements. Our ability to remain competitive in this
market will depend in part upon our ability to develop new and enhanced systems and to introduce
these systems at competitive prices and on a timely and cost effective basis.</P>

<P>We devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and
development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with our customers to remain responsive
to their product needs. We have also sought to reduce the development cycle for new products through
a collaborative process whereby our engineering, manufacturing and marketing personnel work closely
together with one another and with our customers at an earlier stage in the process. We also use 3D,
computer-aided design, finite element analysis and other computer-based modeling methods to test
new designs. We conduct our research and development programs at our facilities in Beverly,
Massachusetts and in Rockville, Maryland. SEN also conducts research and development in Toyo, Japan.</P>

<P>Our product development efforts have led to numerous industry breakthroughs, including the
first production high current implantation system, the first production high energy implanter and
the first photostabilizer.</P>

<P>Our expenditures for research and development during 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $68.8 million,
$51.6 million and $78.7 million, respectively, or 10.1%, 13.0% and 29.6% of net sales, respectively.
The increase in research and development expenditures in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily reflected
our research focus to develop products capable of processing 300 millimeter wafers.  We expect in
future years that research and development expenditures will continue to represent a substantial
percentage of net sales.</P>

<B><P>Manufacturing</P>

</B><P>We manufacture our products at facilities in Beverly, Massachusetts and in Rockville,
Maryland. In addition, SEN manufactures products at its facility in Toyo, Japan.</P>

<P>Our Beverly, Massachusetts facility manufactures our high energy, high current and high
tilt/medium current ion implantation and rapid thermal processing systems. In 1999, we completed
an 80,000 square foot expansion of this facility.  We manufacture photoresist removal and curing
systems in our Rockville, Maryland facility, including our photostabilizer and dry strip product
lines. </P>

<P>Our manufacturing facilities employ advanced manufacturing methods and technologies,
including lean manufacturing, Six Sigma controls and processes and web-enabled inventory purchase
systems. We manufacture our products in cleanroom environments that are similar to the cleanrooms
used by semiconductor manufacturers for wafer fabrication. Most of our systems are designed and
tailored to meet the customer's specifications as outlined in the sales contract.</P>

<P>To ensure that the customer's specifications are satisfied, per contract terms, the
systems are tested at our facilities prior to shipment, normally with the customer present,
under conditions that substantially replicate the customer's production environment and the
customer's criteria are confirmed to have been met. These environmental conditions include
power requirements, toxic gas usage, air handling requirements including humidity and temperature,
equipment bay configuration, wafer characteristics and other factors. These procedures are intended
to reduce installation and production qualification times and the amount of particulates and other
contaminants in the assembled system, which in turn improves yield and reduces downtime for the customer.</P>

<P>After testing, the system is disassembled and packaged to maintain cleanroom standards
during shipment. Installation is itself not a complex process and does not require specialized
skills. It is typically performed by a team of assemblers from the customer and ourselves. It
includes placing and leveling the equipment at its installation site, connecting it to sources
of gas, water and electricity and recalibrating it to specifications that had previously been
tested and met.</P>

<P>We purchase materials, components and subassemblies, such as pumps, machine components,
power supplies and other electrical components, from various suppliers. These items are either
standard products or built to our specifications. Some of the components and subassemblies
included in our products are obtained either from a sole source or a limited group of suppliers,
which could result in disruptions to our operations. We have installed a web-based supply chain
system in order to increase efficiency and cut costs associated with obtaining materials and
components. This system electronically exchanges information with our vendors as to purchase
orders, forecasts and automatic delivery updates.</P>

<P>We recognize sales at the time of shipment to the customer. We have a demonstrated
history of customer acceptance subsequent to shipment and installation of our systems. We
believe that the customer's post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process are
routine from a commercial standpoint because the process is a replication of pre-shipment
procedures. We have never failed to successfully complete a system installation. However,
should an installation not be successfully completed, our contractual provisions do not provide
for forfeitures, refunds or other purchase price concessions beyond those prescribed by the
provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code applicable generally to these transactions.</P>

<B><P>Competition</P>

</B><P>The semiconductor equipment market is highly competitive and is characterized by a
small number of large participants. We compete in four principal product markets primarily at
the front-end of the semiconductor manufacturing process: ion implantation, dry strip, photostabilization
and rapid thermal processing.   Preexisting relationships have a significant influence on a customer's
choice of equipment supplier.  Other significant competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment
market include price/cost of ownership, performance, customer support, breadth of product line,
distribution and financial viability. </P>

<B><I><P>Ion Implantation. </I> </B>In high energy equipment, our principal competitor is Varian
Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. ("Varian"). In high current products, we and Applied Materials
Inc. have substantial market shares. In high tilt/medium current equipment, where we have a small market
share, Varian has a commanding market position. SEN is the largest manufacturer of ion implantation
equipment in Japan and competes with Nissin Electric Co., Ltd., Ulvac Technologies, Inc., Varian and
Applied Materials Inc. for sales in that market.</P>

<B><I><P>Dry Strip, Photostabilization and Rapid Thermal Processing.</I>  </B>Our principal
competitors in the dry strip product market are, Mattson Technology Inc., and GaSonics International
Corp., recently acquired by Novellus Systems, Inc. and our principal competitor in photostabilization
is Ushio Inc. Our chief competitor in the rapid thermal processing equipment market is Applied
Materials Inc.</P>

<P> <B>Intellectual Property</P>

</B><P>We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection, as well as
contractual restrictions, in the United States and in other countries to protect our proprietary
rights in our products and our business. As of February 28, 2001, we had 142 patents in the
United States and 271 patents in other countries, as well as 472 patent applications (75 in
the United States and 397 in other countries) on file with various patent agencies worldwide.
We intend to file additional patent applications as appropriate. Although patents are important
to our business, we do not believe that we are substantially dependent on any single patent or
any group of patents.</P>

<P>We have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that are maintained to provide
customer recognition for our products in the marketplace. We have a license from Eaton to use
the Eaton trademark and logo for a fixed period of time in connection with the sale of
semiconductor manufacturing equipment. </P>

<P>We have agreements with third parties, mostly as licensor, that provide for the licensing
of patented or proprietary technology. These agreements include royalty-bearing licenses and
technology cross-licenses. Our license agreement with SEN is described above under "SEN Joint
Venture". No other license is material to us.</P>

<P>There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property
rights in semiconductor-related industries.   On January 8, 2001, we filed suit in federal
district court in Boston, Massachusetts against Applied Materials, Inc., alleging infringement
of Axcelis' U.S. Patent No. 4,667,111, tortious interference with contract and prospective
advantageous business relationships, and unfair competition and trade practices.  U.S Patent
No. 4.667,111 recently survived re-examination before the United States Patent and Trademark
Office, the request for re-examination being made by Applied Materials, Inc.</P>

<P>We can give no assurance that we, our licensors, licensees, customers or suppliers
will not be subject to claims of patent infringement or claims to invalidate our patents,
and that any such claim will not be successful and require us to pay substantial damages or
delete certain features from our products or both.</P>

<B><P>Backlog</P>

</B><P>As of December 31, 2000, our backlog was $211.0 million, as compared to $93.8
million, and $27.8 million, respectively, for year end 1999 and 1998.  Our policy is to
include in backlog only those orders for which we have accepted purchase orders. All orders
are subject to cancellations or rescheduling by customers with limited or no penalties. Due
to possible changes in system delivery schedules, cancellations of orders and delays in
systems shipments, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of our
actual sales for any succeeding period. In addition, our backlog at the beginning of a
quarter typically does not include all orders required to achieve our sales objectives for
that quarter and is not a reliable indicator of our future sales.</P>

<B><P>Employees</P>

</B><P>As of December 31, 2000, we had 2,056 full-time and 242 temporary employees
worldwide, of which 1,991 were employed in North America, 178 in Asia and 129 in Western
Europe.  All of our employees have entered into confidentiality and noncompetition agreements
with us. At that date, none of our employees based in the United States was represented by a
union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage, slowdown or strike. Our employees based
in Germany are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with
our employees to be good.</P>

<P> <B>Environmental</P>

</B><P>We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we
operate that regulate, among other things: air emissions; water discharges; and the generation,
use, storage, transportation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes produced by
our manufacturing, research and development and sales activities. As with other companies engaged
in like businesses, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of environmental
liabilities, claims, penalties and orders. We believe, however, that our operations are in
substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that there are
no pending environmental matters that would have a material impact on our business.</P>

<P>Our Japanese joint venture manufactures ion implantation products in a 300,300 square foot owned
facility located in Toyo, Japan.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>The Beverly facility includes an 11,000 square foot demonstration line, which is used to develop
next-generation application solutions for specific customers, as well as to demonstrate the full
range of our integrated process equipment. We also have a process technology center in Rockville,
Maryland that is available to customers for developing and testing dry strip and photostabilization
processes.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>We are building a 140,000 square foot facility in Beverly, Massachusetts which will house an
advanced process development, product demonstration and customer training center with all of the
equipment we produce. In 1998, as part of our restructuring, we closed our Austin, Texas ion
implant manufacturing facility and transferred production to our Beverly, Massachusetts facility.
On May 18, 2000, we sold our Austin facility for net proceeds of $11.0 million, a price that
approximated book value. </P>
<P> </P>
<P>We do not believe there is any material, long-term, excess capacity in our facilities,
although utilization is subject to change based on customer demand.  We believe that our
manufacturing facilities and equipment generally are well-maintained, in good operating
condition, suitable for our purposes, and adequate for our present operations. Our Beverly,
Massachusetts and Rockville, Maryland facilities are ISO 9001 certified.</P>

<P>Item 3: Legal Proceedings</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>On January 8, 2001, Axcelis filed a lawsuit against Applied
Materials, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  The
complaint alleges that Applied's medium current/high energy ion implanter machine infringes
an Axcelis patent for ion implantation equipment using radio frequency linear accelerator
technology.  Axcelis has also alleged that Applied unlawfully interfered with Axcelis'
existing and future contracts.  On January 18, 2001, Axcelis filed a motion for a preliminary
injunction, asking the court to stop Applied from manufacturing, selling or offering to sell
its medium current/high energy ion implanter machine and to order Applied to remove all
Axcelis patented technology from implanters that Applied may have placed in chipmakers' plants
for process development trials.  The parties are engaged in the process of discovery and, based
on the scheduling order entered by the court, a trial is scheduled for the third quarter of 2001.
The Company believes its claims are meritorious and intends to pursue the matter vigorously.
Although there can be no assurance of a favorable outcome, the Company does not believe that
this matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results
of operations.</P>

and Results of Operations</P>

</FONT>
</B>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following
discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, that involve risks
and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by
these forward-looking statements due to certain factors, including those discussed in this
Management's Discussion and Analysis under the heading "Outlook," and in Exhibit 99 to this
Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</P>
<B>
<P>Overview</P>
</B>

<P>We are a leading producer of ion implantation, dry strip and photostabilization
equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors. We have recently introduced rapid thermal
processing equipment, which is used in semiconductor manufacturing primarily before and after
the ion implantation process.  In addition, we provide extensive aftermarket service and support,
including spare parts, equipment upgrades, maintenance services and customer training.  We have a
50-50 joint venture with Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd. in Japan.</P>
<B><U>
</U><P>Separation from Eaton Corporation</P>
</B>
<P>Prior to the initial public offering on July 10, 2000, we were a wholly owned
subsidiary of Eaton Corporation (Eaton).  On June 30, 2000, Eaton substantially completed the
transfer to us of all of the assets of its semiconductor equipment operations that were not
previously owned by us, and we assumed the related liabilities.  On December 29, 2000, Eaton
completed the divestiture of its investment in Axcelis by distributing its remaining 82%
ownership interest in Axcelis in the form of a spin-off to Eaton shareholders. We also entered
into various other agreements with Eaton which provide for transitional services and support,
including those associated with voice and data transmissions and other data-related operations,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, fixed assets, payroll, general accounting, financial
accounting consolidation, cash management, human resources, tax, legal and real estate.  Under
these agreements, we reimbursed Eaton for its direct and indirect costs of providing these services
until completion of the divestiture, and thereafter, for a limited time, we will reimburse Eaton
for its costs plus an additional fee.  The transition periods covered by these agreements generally
expire by December 29, 2001.  The agreements do not necessarily reflect the costs of obtaining
these services from unrelated third parties or of providing the applicable services in-house.
However, management believes that purchasing these services from Eaton provides an efficient
means of obtaining these services during the transition period.  We must also negotiate new
agreements with various third parties as a separate, standalone entity.  There can be no assurance
that the terms we will be able to negotiate for these agreements will be as favorable as those we
have enjoyed as part of Eaton. </P>

<B><P>Basis of Presentation</P>

</B><P>On June 30, 2000, Eaton substantially completed the transfer of all the assets and
related liabilities of its semiconductor equipment operations to us.  Prior to the transfer, the
financial statements of the semiconductor equipment operations were presented on a combined basis.
Prior to the initial public offering, Eaton did not account for or operate Axcelis as a separate,
stand-alone entity and, as a result, the financial information included herein may not reflect our
consolidated financial position, operating results and cash flows during the periods presented prior
to the initial public offering or in the future, if it had been a separate, stand-alone entity.</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><B><P>Fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 in comparison to the fiscal year
ended December 31, 1999</P></B>

<B><P>Net Sales</P></B>
<P>Net sales were $680.4 million in fiscal 2000, an increase of $283.1 million, or 71.3%,
as compared to net sales of $397.3 million in fiscal 1999. The increase in net sales was
attributable to continued high levels of capital spending by our semiconductor manufacturing
customers, resulting in increased demand for our products and services.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Sales of ion implant products and services accounted for $534.4 million in total sales in
fiscal 2000, an increase of $212.4 million, or 66.0%, as compared to $322.0 million in fiscal
1999. Sales of other products and services, including dry strip products, photostabilization
products and rapid thermal processing systems, accounted for $146.0 million in total sales in
fiscal 2000, an increase of $70.7 million, or 94.0%, as compared to $75.3 million in fiscal 1999.</P>
<P> </P>
<B><P>Gross Profit</P>
</B><P>Gross profit was $299.3 million in fiscal 2000, an increase of $142.2 million, or 90.5%,
as compared to gross profit of $157.1 million in fiscal 1999. The increase in gross profit was
primarily attributable to increased products and services sales volume. Gross profit as a percentage
of net sales increased to 44.0% in fiscal 2000 from 39.5% in fiscal 1999. This increase was due
primarily to improved capacity utilization as a result of higher sales volume and, to a lesser extent,
to a more favorable product mix of dry strip and photostabilization products.</P>
<P> </P>
<B><P>Research and development</B> </P>
<P>Research and development expense was $68.8 million in fiscal 2000, an increase of $17.2 million,
or 33.3%, as compared to $51.6 million in fiscal 1999. As a percentage of net sales, research and
development expense decreased to 10.1% in fiscal 2000 from 13.0% in fiscal 1999, as costs were spread
over a higher revenue base. We continue to invest significantly in both current product enhancements
and new product development.</P>

<B><P>Selling</B> </P>
<P>Selling expense was $56.4 million in fiscal 2000, an increase of  $18.5 million, or 48.7%, as
compared to $37.9 million in fiscal 1999.  The increase in selling expense was primarily due to
increased headcount and related expenses associated with increased sales volume.  As a percentage
of net sales, selling expense decreased to 8.3% in fiscal 2000 as compared to 9.5% in fiscal 1999,
as costs were spread over a higher revenue base.</P>
<P> </P>
<B><P>General and Administrative</B> </P>
<P>General and administrative expense, including the allocation of Eaton general corporate expenses
to our business, was $60.2 million in fiscal 2000, an increase of $14.3 million, or 31.1%, as compared
with $45.9 million in fiscal 1999. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily
attributable to increased spending for additional headcount and related expenses to support the growth
in sales as well as higher expenses related to transitioning to a stand-alone public company.   As a
percentage of net sales, general and administrative expense decreased to 8.9% in fiscal 2000 as compared
with 11.6% in fiscal 1999 as these costs were spread over a higher revenue base.</P>
<B><P> </P>
</B>
<B><P>Amortization of Goodwill and Intangible Assets</B> </P>
<P>Amortization of goodwill and intangible assets was $9.3 million in fiscal 2000, consistent with
fiscal 1999.</P>
<P> </P>
<B><P>Income from Operations</B> </P>
<P>Income from operations was $104.6 million in fiscal 2000 as compared to $12.3 million in fiscal
1999, primarily as a result of the factors described above.</P>
<P> </P>
<B><P>Other Income (Expense)</B> </P>
<P>Total other income was $39.6 million in fiscal 2000 as compared to  $7.2 million in fiscal 1999.
Other income consists primarily of royalty income and equity income from SEN. Royalty income, primarily
from SEN, was $15.1 million in fiscal 2000 as compared to $5.9 million in fiscal 1999.  Equity income
attributable to SEN was $19.6 million in fiscal 2000 compared to $1.3 million in fiscal 1999. Both
increases in fiscal 2000 were due to increased SEN sales volume due primarily to the recovery in the
Japanese semiconductor market, which began in late 1999.  Interest income of $5.8 million in fiscal
2000 was earned from the net proceeds from the initial public offering and significantly higher cash
balances generated from operating activities.</P>
<P> </P>
<B><P>Income Taxes </P>
</B><P>Income taxes were $45.2 million in fiscal 2000 as compared with  $5.1 million in fiscal 1999.
Our effective income tax rate was 31.3% in fiscal 2000 as compared to 26.2% in fiscal 1999.  The tax
rate in both periods differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes,
undistributed nontaxable equity income from SEN, credits from increased research activities and
increased foreign sales corporation benefits.  See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.</P>
<P> </P>
<B><P>Net Income (Loss)</B> </P>
<P>Net income increased to $99.1 million in fiscal 2000 from $14.4 million fiscal 1999, principally
as a result of the factors discussed above.</P>

<B><P>Fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 in comparison to the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998</P>

<P>Net Sales</P>
</B><P>Net sales in 1999 were $397.3 million, an increase of $131.6 million, or 49.5%, as
compared to net sales of $265.7 million in 1998. The increase in net sales was attributable
to the increased demand for our principal products and services resulting from the semiconductor
industry's recovery, which began in the second half of 1999. Our third quarter 1999 net sales
increased 125.4% over the third quarter of 1998, and fourth quarter 1999 net sales increased
193.7% over the fourth quarter of 1998.</P>

<P>Sales of our ion implant systems and services accounted for $322.0 million in total sales in
1999 as compared to $219.9 million in 1998, an increase of 46.4% over 1998. Sales of other products
and services, including dry strip products, photostabilization products and rapid thermal processing
systems, accounted for $75.3 million in total sales in fiscal 1999, an increase of $29.5 million, or
64.4%, as compared to $45.8 million in fiscal 1998.</P>

<B><P>Gross Profit</P>
</B><P>Gross profit was $157.1 million in 1999, an increase of $92.9 million, or 144.6%, as compared
with gross profit of $64.2 million in 1998. Of this increase, $31.9 million resulted from increased
sales while $43.6 million was due primarily to improved capacity utilization resulting from higher
product sales volume. In addition, gross profit in 1998 was reduced by $17.4 million of
restructuring charges for inventory writedowns. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net
sales to 39.5% in 1999 from 24.2% in 1998 was due to improved capacity utilization, increased sales
and the absence of restructuring charges in 1999.</P>
<B>
<P>Research and Development</P>
</B><P>Research and development expense was $51.6 million in 1999, a decrease of $27.1 million, or
34.4%, as compared to $78.7 million in 1998. As a percentage of net sales, research and development
expense was 13.0% in 1999 and 29.6% in 1998. Approximately $17.2 million of the decrease in expense
was attributable primarily to synergy savings associated with the closing of our Austin, Texas
facility and the subsequent transfer of Austin's ion implant engineering activities to our Beverly,
Massachusetts facility. The balance of the decrease was attributable to a reallocation of our
research and development efforts following our 1998 restructuring and the completion of certain
research projects.</P>
<P>  </P>
<B><P>Selling</P>
</B><P>Selling expense was $37.9 million in 1999, a decline of $4.2 million, or 9.9%, as compared
to $42.1 million in 1998. The reduction in selling expense between years was driven principally
by headcount savings attributable to our cost reduction strategy that was initiated in the second
quarter of 1998 and continued into the second quarter of 1999. As a percentage of net sales,
selling expense decreased to 9.5% in 1999 as compared to 15.9% in 1998.</P>
<P>  </P>
<B><P>General and Administrative</P>
</B><P>General and administrative expense, including the allocation of Eaton general corporate
expenses to our business, was $45.9 million in 1999, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 2.4%, as
compared with $47.1 million in 1998. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative
expense decreased to 11.6% in 1999 as compared with 17.7% in 1998 as these costs were spread
over a higher revenue base. The allocation of Eaton general corporate expense was $15.0 million
in 1999 as compared to $14.8 million in 1998. </P>

<B><P>Amortization of Goodwill and Intangible Assets</P>
</B><P>Amortization of goodwill and intangible assets was $9.3 million in 1999, consistent with 1998.</P>
<P>  </P>
<B><P>Income (Loss) from Operations</P>
</B><P>Income from operations was $12.3 million in 1999 as compared to a loss from operations of
$137.9 million in 1998, primarily as a result of the factors described above.</P>
<P> </P>
<B><P>Other Income (Expense)</P>
</B><P>Total other income was $7.2 million in 1999, an increase of $2.4 million, or 51.3%, as
compared to $4.8 million in 1998. Other income primarily consisted of royalty income and equity
income from SEN. Royalty income, more than half of which was from SEN, was $5.9 million in 1999,
as compared to $7.9 million in 1998, or a decrease of 26.4%. The decrease in 1999 was due to
income in 1998 from a large one-time royalty payment from an unrelated party. Equity income
attributable to SEN was $1.3 million in 1999 as compared to a loss of $2.1 million in 1998.
This increase primarily reflects a 19.4% increase in SEN sales volume in 1999 as compared to
1998 as a result of improvements in the Japanese semiconductor market.</P>
<P> </P>
<B><P>Income Taxes (Credit)</P>
</B><P>Income tax expense was $5.1 million in 1999 as compared with an income tax credit of
$51.1 million in 1998, which was generated by our loss from operations in that year. The effective
tax rate for 1999 was 26.2% which included a credit for research activities, as compared to an
effective tax rate of 38.4% in 1998. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.</P>
<P> </P>
<B><P>Net Income (Loss)</P>
</B><P>Net income increased to $14.4 million in 1999 as compared to a loss of $82.0 million in
1998, principally as a result of the factors discussed above.</P>


</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=3><P>Liquidity and Capital Resources</P></B></FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2000 were $168.2 million,
compared to $3.5 million at December 31, 1999.  The significant increase in cash between years
was due mainly to higher net income of $99.1 million, net proceeds received from the initial
public offering of $348.6 million, partially offset by the payment of a $300 million dividend
to Eaton, and the sale of our Austin, Texas facility for $11.0 million.  Net working capital
was $297.3 million at December 31, 2000 as compared to net working capital of $169.8 million
as of December 31, 1999.  The increases in cash, accounts receivable and inventory were the
primary causes of the increase in working capital, all of which increased primarily as a result
of higher business volume in fiscal 2000.</P>

<P>Cash provided by operating activities was $99.7 million for fiscal 2000 as compared to net
cash used of $39.1 million for fiscal 1999.  The cash provided by operating activities for fiscal
2000 was primarily the result of improved earnings performance and working capital management.
Cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the initial public
offering of $348.6 million offset by the payment of a $300.0 million cash dividend to Eaton.  </P>

<P>Capital expenditures were $21.8 million in fiscal 2000 and $16.9 million in fiscal 1999.
The amount of future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the
timing and rate of the expansion of our business.  We anticipate increased capital expenditures
to support our worldwide sales growth including the expansion of our Beverly, Massachusetts facility.</P>

<P>Axcelis' liquidity is affected by many factors.  Some of these factors are based on normal
operations of the business and others relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the
semiconductor equipment industry.  Although our cash requirements fluctuate based on the timing
and extent of these factors, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be
sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.</P>


</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=3><P>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities".  This statement revises accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities.  SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS
No. 138, is effective for fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.
Axcelis will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 and does not expect the
adoption to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.</P>

<P>In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements".  SAB 101, which was
subsequently amended by SAB No. 101A and SAB 101B (collectively referred to as SAB 101)
provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial
statements.  Axcelis has concluded that its revenue recognition policy continues to be
appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and SAB 101.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=3><P>Outlook</P></B></FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>The growth in our business from 1998 to 1999 and from
1999 to 2000 should not be read as an indication of our performance in 2001.  The semiconductor
industry is highly cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns that have had a severe
adverse impact on the semiconductor industry and on suppliers to the semiconductor industry,
including us. Our business depends in significant part upon capital expenditures by
semiconductor manufacturers, especially manufacturers that are opening new or expanding
existing fabrication facilities. The level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers
depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and the products
utilizing them, the available manufacturing capacity in manufacturers' fabrication facilities,
and the ability of manufacturers to increase productivity in existing facilities without
incurring additional capital expenditures.   If existing fabrication facilities are not
expanded or new facilities are not built as rapidly as anticipated, demand for our systems
may decline, and we may be unable to generate significant new orders for our systems, which
would adversely affect our sales levels.  We derive most of our revenues from the sale of a
relatively small number of expensive products to a small number of customers. The list prices
on these products range from $150,000 to over $4.0 million.  At our current sales level, each
sale, or failure to make a sale, could have a material effect on us in a particular quarter. </P>

<P>In addition, the continued requirements for investments in engineering, research and
development and marketing necessary to develop new products and to maintain extensive
customer service and support capabilities limit our ability to reduce expenses during
downturns in proportion to declining sales.</P>

<P>We are also exposed to the risks associated with an apparent slowdown in the U.S.
economy.  Concerns about inflation, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate
profits and a slowdown in the sale of electronic goods suggest slower growth in the U.S.
economy. A slowing domestic economy may materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. </P>

<P>Exhibit 99 hereto contains additional information about important factors that
may cause our actual results to differ from our past performance and from performance
contemplated by any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report.  That information
is incorporated herein by reference.</P>

&nbsp;
<FONT SIZE=3><B><P>Item 7a: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk</P></B></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2><B><P>Interest Rate Sensitivity</P></B>
<P>Axcelis' exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily
to our investment portfolio, which consists entirely of cash-equivalents as of December
31, 2000.  The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal
while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk.  This is accomplished by
investing in marketable high investment grade securities, and by limiting exposure to
any one issue or issuer.  We do not use derivative financial instruments in managing our
investment portfolio and, due to the nature of our investments, we do not expect our
operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by any change
in market interest rates.  As of December 31, 2000, all investments mature within 60
days and are carried at cost, which approximates fair market value.</P>

<B><P>Foreign Currency Exchange Risk</P>
</B><P>Prior to our separation from Eaton, our exposure to foreign currency exchange
rate risk was managed on an enterprise-wide basis as part of Eaton's risk management
strategy.  Having now separated from Eaton, we will manage our exchange rate risk on
an independent basis.  Currently, substantially all of our sales are billed in U.S.
dollars, thereby reducing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on our
results.  Our investment in SEN and our royalty and equity income from SEN are subject
to foreign currency exchange risks.</P>

<P>Axcelis Technologies, Inc.</P>

<P>We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Axcelis Technologies,
Inc. (the &quot;Company&quot;) as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2000.  Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at Item 14 (a). These financial statements and schedule are
the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. </P>
<P>We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

<P>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Axcelis Technologies,
Inc. at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  Also, in our opinion,
the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein.</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><B><P>Note 1.  Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation</B>

<P>Axcelis Technologies, Inc. ("Axcelis" or the "Company"), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Eaton Corporation ("Eaton") prior to July 10, 2000, is a leading producer
of ion implantation, dry strip and photostabilization equipment used in the fabrication
of semiconductors in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. The Company has recently
introduced rapid thermal processing equipment, which is used in semiconductor manufacturing
primarily before and after the ion implantation process.  In addition, the Company provides
extensive aftermarket service and support, including spare parts, equipment upgrades,
maintenance services and customer training. The Company has a 50-50 joint venture with
Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd. in Japan.  This joint venture, which is known as Sumitomo
Eaton Nova Corporation, or SEN, licenses technology from the company for ion implantation,
has exclusive rights to the territory of Japan and is the leading producer of ion implantation
equipment in Japan.</P>

<P>On April 26, 2000, Eaton announced its plan to reorganize its semiconductor equipment
operations into an independent, publicly-held company, Axcelis Technologies, Inc.  On June
30, 2000, Eaton substantially completed the transfer of all the assets and related liabilities
of its semiconductor equipment operations to the Company.  Prior to the transfer, the financial
statements of the semiconductor equipment operations were presented on a combined basis.  On July
10, 2000, the Company commenced its initial public offering (IPO) of 15,500,000 shares of common
stock.  On July 20, 2000, the IPO was completed when the underwriters of the IPO exercised their
over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1,550,000 shares. A portion of the net proceeds
of the offering of $348.6 million was used to pay a previously declared $300 million dividend to
Eaton. Eaton owned approximately 82 percent of Axcelis' outstanding common stock.  On October 25, 2000,
Eaton announced that its board of directors had declared a stock dividend of all remaining shares
of Axcelis held by Eaton.  The dividend was distributed on December 29, 2000.  The distribution
was made on the basis of 1.179023 shares of Axcelis for each Eaton common share outstanding.</P>

<P>Axcelis' legal separation from Eaton occurred on June 30, 2000, at which time the Company began
to operate independently from Eaton. Subsequent to June 30, 2000, the Company's financial statements
are prepared on a consolidated basis.  Although prior periods have been prepared on a combined basis,
all statements presented are referred to as consolidated statements for simplicity.  For periods prior
to the separation date, the consolidated financial statements reflect historical results of operations
and cash flows of Eaton's semiconductor equipment operations during each respective period, and include
allocations of certain Eaton expenses, as discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2000, Axcelis' consolidated financial statements no longer
include an allocated portion of Eaton's corporate services and infrastructure costs.  However, the
Company has continued to incur amounts payable to Eaton in connection with transitional agreements,
under which Eaton provides services, such as voice and data transmissions and other data-related
 operations, accounts receivable, accounts payable, fixed assets, payroll, general accounting,
financial accounting consolidation, cash management, human resources, tax, legal and real estate.</P>

<B><P>Note 2.  Significant Accounting Policies</P></B>

<B><P>Principles of Consolidation</P></B>

<P>The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Axcelis and its subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  The equity
method is used to account for the 50% investment in SEN.</P>

<B><P>Use of Estimates</P>
</B>
<P>The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.</P>

<B><P>Foreign Currency </P>

</B><P>The functional currency for all operations outside the United States is the local currency.
Financial statements for these operations are translated into United States dollars at year-end rates
as to assets and liabilities and average exchange rates as to revenues and expenses.  The resulting
translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders' equity as an element of accumulated comprehensive
income (loss).   Foreign currency transaction gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statements
of operations are not material for all periods presented.</P>

<B><P>Cash and Cash Equivalents</P>

</B><P>Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments (primarily time deposits) acquired with
a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition.  Prior to Axcelis' initial
public offering, Eaton managed cash and cash equivalents on a centralized basis. Cash receipts associated
with Axcelis' business were transferred to Eaton and Eaton funded Axcelis' cash disbursements.  The
amount for cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 1999 substantially relates to cash and highly
liquid short-term investments maintained for working capital purposes, primarily at international
locations.</P>

<B><P>Inventories</P>

</B><P>Inventories are carried at lower of cost, determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method, or market.</P>

<B><P>Shipping and Handling Costs</P>

</B><P>Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of products sold.</P>

<B><P>Long-Lived Assets</P>

</B><P>Depreciation and amortization are computed by the straight-line method for financial statement
purposes.  The historical cost of buildings is depreciated over forty years and machinery and
equipment principally over three to ten years.  Substantially all goodwill is amortized over fifteen
years.  Intangible assets, consisting of developed technology, are amortized over seven years.</P>

<P>Goodwill and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  Events or circumstances that
would result in an impairment review primarily include operations reporting losses or a significant
change in the use of an asset.  The asset would be considered impaired when the future net undiscounted
cash flows generated by the asset are less than its carrying value.  An impairment loss would be
recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.</P>

<B><P>Concentration of Credit Risk</P>

</B><P>Financial instruments, which potentially expose Axcelis to concentrations of credit risk,
consist principally of accounts receivable and cash equivalents.  Axcelis' customers consist of
semiconductor manufacturers located throughout the world.  Axcelis performs ongoing credit evaluations
of its customers' financial condition and generally requires no collateral to secure accounts receivable.
Axcelis maintains a reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on its assessment
of the collectibility of accounts receivable.</P>

<B><P>Financial Instruments</P></B>

<P>Axcelis has no material financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 1000 used to
manage foreign exchange or interest rate risk.  In 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", was issued.  This Statement
requires all derivatives to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value.  Axcelis must adopt the
standard by the first quarter of 2001.  It expects that the adoption of the standard will have an
immaterial effect on financial position and operating results, if any.</P>

<B><P>Revenue Recognition</P>

</B><P>Axcelis recognizes sales at the time of shipment of the system to the customer. The costs of
installation at the customer's site are accrued at the time of shipment. Management believes the
customer's post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process have been established to be
routine, commercially inconsequential and perfunctory because the process is a replication of the
pre-shipment procedures. The majority of Axcelis' systems are designed and tailored to meet the customer's
specifications as outlined in the contract between the customer and Axcelis. To ensure that the customer's
specifications are satisfied, per contract terms, the systems are tested at Axcelis' facilities prior
to shipment, normally with the customer present, under conditions that substantially replicate the
customer's production environment and the customer's criteria are confirmed to have been met. Axcelis
has never failed to successfully complete a system installation. Should an installation not be
successfully completed, the contractual provisions do not provide for forfeiture, refund or other
purchase price concession beyond those prescribed by the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code
applicable generally to such transactions. Installation is non-complex and does not require specialized
skills, and the related costs are predictable and insignificant to the total purchase price. Axcelis
has a demonstrated history of customer acceptance subsequent to shipment and installation of these
systems.</P>

<P>In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
(SAB) No. 101, "Revenue Recognition". SAB No. 101, which was subsequently amended by Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 101A (collectively referred to as SAB 101), articulates certain of the SEC staff's views
in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements.
Axcelis has concluded that its revenue recognition policy continues to be appropriate and in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and SAB 101.</P>
<B>
<P>Income Taxes</P>

</B><P>Axcelis' results historically have been included in Eaton's consolidated U.S. and state income
tax returns and in tax returns of certain Eaton foreign subsidiaries.  The provision for income taxes
in Axcelis' consolidated financial statements has been determined on a separate-return basis.  Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts.</P>

<P>Through December 29, 2000, Eaton accounted and paid for all United States income taxes. Axcelis'
taxable income (loss) related to its United States operations was included in Eaton's consolidated
income tax returns for 1999 and 1998 and will be included in Eaton's 2000 tax returns.</P>

<P>Consistent with the terms of the tax sharing agreement with Eaton, the consolidated statements
of operations include an allocation of Eaton's United States income taxes (credit) in amounts generally
equivalent to the provisions which would have resulted had the Company filed separate income tax returns
for the years presented. The Company has also been allocated United States deferred income taxes based
on the estimated differences between the book and tax bases of its assets and liabilities. </P>

<P>Several of Axcelis' operations outside the United States account and pay for income taxes related
to their operations. For those operations which have not accounted and paid for income taxes related
to their operations, the consolidated statements of operations include an allocation of Eaton's
foreign income taxes in amounts generally equivalent to the provisions which would have resulted
had Axcelis filed separate income tax returns for the years presented.  These operations have also
been allocated foreign deferred income taxes based on the estimated differences between the book
and tax bases of their assets and liabilities.</P>

<P> <B>Stock-Based Compensation</B></P>

<P>Axcelis applies the intrinsic value based method described in Accounting Principles Board
Opinion (APB) No. 25 to account for stock options granted to employees.  Under this method, no
compensation expense is recognized on the grant date, since on that date the option price equals
the market price of the underlying common shares.</P>

<B><P>Net Income (Loss) Per Share</P>

</B><P>Basic net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average shares of common
stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per share is calculated based on the
weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, plus the dilutive effect of stock options,
calculated using the treasury stock method. </P>

<B><P>Note 3.  Restructuring Charges</P>

</B><P>Due to the decline of the semiconductor capital equipment market in 1998, Axcelis took
actions in the third quarter of 1998 to restructure its business and recorded restructuring
charges of $42.4 million ($27.5 million aftertax).</P>

<P>Several specific actions comprised the overall restructuring efforts, including workforce
reductions, asset write-downs and other restructuring actions.  The charge for workforce reductions,
primarily severance and other related employee benefits, included the termination of approximately
475 employees, primarily manufacturing personnel.  Approximately half of the workforce reductions
related to the closing of the Austin, Texas plant.  The charge for asset write-downs included $17.4
million for inventory, which was written down to estimated market value, and is included in cost
of products sold.  The ion implantation equipment manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas was
closed and production was transferred to Beverly, Massachusetts.  The write-down of this plant
to estimated selling price represented approximately $2.1 million of the restructuring charge.
The phase-out of production was concluded in the first quarter of 1999.  Further, the Thermal
Processing Systems product line, located in Peabody, Massachusetts, was merged into the Fusion
Systems division in Rockville, Maryland and the Flat Panel Equipment product line was merged
into the Implant Systems division in Beverly, Massachusetts.</P>

<B><P>Note 8.  Defined Contribution Plan</B> </P>

<P>During 2000, the Company established the Axcelis Long-Term Investment Plan,
a defined contribution plan that became effective on January 1, 2001.  All
regular employees are eligible to participate and may contribute up to 17%
of their eligible compensation, subject to limitations set by federal income
tax regulations.  The Company will match 50% of contributions for the first 6%
of eligible pay contributed by the employee.  No expense was recognized in 2000
under this plan.</P>

<P>Prior to the Company's separation from Eaton, Axcelis employees participated
in defined benefit and defined contribution plans of Eaton.  Expense recorded
during 2000, 1999 and 1998 for all defined benefit and defined contribution plans
was $9.2 million, $5.1 million and $6.9 million, respectively.  In connection with
the separation on December 29, 2000, Axcelis employees participating in Eaton's
domestic pension plan fully vested, and the pension obligation for these employees
remained with Eaton.  Axcelis continues to provide pension benefits to employees in

<P>Axcelis Stock Option Plan</P>

</B><P>During 2000, the Company adopted the Axcelis Technologies, Inc. 2000 Stock
Plan (the Plan), a stock award and incentive plan which permits the issuance of
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and performance awards to
selected employees, directors and consultants of the Company.  The Plan reserved
18.5 million shares of common stock for grant under the Plan.  Expiration of options
or stock appreciation rights are based on award agreements, or in the case of incentive
stock options, awards expire ten years from the date of grant.  Non-qualified stock
options may, if approved by the Board of Directors, have a stated term in excess of
ten years.  Generally, awards terminate upon termination of employment for options
granted to employees.  Under the terms of the Plan, the exercise price, determined
by the Board of Directors, may not be less than the fair market value of a share of
the Company's common stock on the date of grant. </P>

options as of and for the year ended December 31, 2000:</P>

</B><P>Eaton has stock option plans under which Axcelis employees were granted
options, through July 11, 2000, to purchase Eaton common shares at prices equal

<P>The stock option activity for options granted to Axcelis employees under Eaton's
stock option plans was not significant during the period January 1, 2000 through July
11, 2000.  On January 24, 2001, Axcelis' Board of Directors approved, effective as of
December 29, 2000, the assumption, by Axcelis, of substantially all of the stock options
originally issued by Eaton that were outstanding at December 29, 2000 and held by individuals
who were employees of Axcelis on that date.  To effect this assumption, Axcelis' Board of
Directors approved the conversion of each Eaton option to Axcelis options in a manner that
resulted in Axcelis employees receiving the same intrinsic value and ratio of exercise
price per share to market value per share as they had prior to conversion.  In addition,
each new Axcelis option resulting from this conversion will have the same vesting provisions
and terms as the Eaton options assumed.  Approximately 423,400 Eaton options were converted
to 3,586,103 Axcelis options. The converted options were not issued through the Axcelis stock
option plan and, therefore, are not included in the stock option activity disclosed above for
the Plan.  A summary of the options outstanding at December 31, 2000 follows:</P>

</B></FONT>
<P>As permitted under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, Axcelis has elected to follow APB No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting
for stock-based awards to employees.  Under APB No. 25, the Company recognizes no
compensation expense with respect to such awards, since on the date the options
were granted, the option price equaled the market value of the common shares.</P>

<P>Pro forma information regarding net income (loss) is required by SFAS No. 123.
This information is required to be determined as if Axcelis had accounted for
stock-based awards to its employees granted subsequent to 1995 under the fair
value method of that Statement.  The fair values of the options granted under
the Axcelis stock option plan and the Eaton stock option plans have been estimated
at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes options pricing model with the
following assumptions:</P>

</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Common and Preferred Stock</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Prior to June 2000, Axcelis had authorized
common stock of 1,000 shares with a par value of $1.00 per share; 100 shares were
outstanding and owned by Eaton.  In June 2000, the Axcelis Board of Directors
authorized the conversion of the 100 shares of Axcelis common stock owned by
Eaton into 80 million shares and increased the number of authorized shares to
300 million with a par value of $0.001 per share.    Stockholders' equity has
been restated to give retroactive recognition for the stock split for all periods
presented by reclassifying from Parent Company Investment to common stock the par
value of additional shares arising from the split.  In addition, all references
in the financial statements to the number of shares and per-share amounts of the
Company's common stock have been restated.</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<P>In connection with Eaton's distribution of Axcelis shares to Eaton shareholders,
Axcelis transferred the net Parent Company Investment of $88,904 to paid-in capital.</P>

<P>In June 2000, the Board also authorized the establishment of 30 million shares of
preferred stock with a par value of $0.001.  No shares of preferred stock have been
issued.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="TIMES" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Employee Stock Purchase Plan</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<P>In June 2000, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of the 2000 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, which provides effectively all Axcelis employees the opportunity to purchase
common stock of the Company at less than market prices.  Purchases are made through payroll
deductions up to 10% of the employee's salary.  Generally, employees may purchase Axcelis
common stock at 85% of the market value of the Company's common stock on the first trading
day of each offering period or on the day the stock is purchased, whichever is lower.
The purchase price may be adjusted by a committee of the Board of Directors.  Compensation
expense is not recognized by the Company because the plan is a non-compensatory plan under
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The number of shares of common stock that may be
issued under the stock purchase plan is 2.5 million shares, plus an annual increase to be
added on the last day of each fiscal year beginning in 2001 equal to one percent of the
outstanding shares on such date, or a lesser amount approved by the Board of Directors.
The maximum shares that may be issued under the plan may not exceed 7.5 million shares.
No shares were issued under the plan in 2000, as the effective date of the plan was January
1, 2001.</P>

<P>Note 11.  Lease Commitments</P>

</B><P>At December 31, 2000, the Company had lease commitments through 2004.  Minimum rental
commitments under noncancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates and in most
cases contain renewel options, are as follows (in millions): 2001, $8.4; 2002, $6.2; 2003,
$4.2; 2004, $2.6. </P>

<P>Rental expense in 2000, 1999 and 1998 (in millions) was $7.8, $4.8 and $5.6, respectively.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Note 16.  Transactions with Eaton Corporation</P>

</B><P>Prior to the initial public offering, Axcelis' consolidated statements of
operations include an allocation of Eaton's general corporate expenses to reflect the
services provided or benefits received by Axcelis.  Such allocated expenses were
(in millions) $8.2 in 2000, $15.0 in 1999 and $14.8 in 1998.  This allocation was
based on Eaton's internal expense allocation methodology which charged these expenses
to operating locations based both on net working capital, excluding cash equivalents
and short-term debt, and on property, plant and equipment - net.  Management believes
this was a reasonable method of allocating these expenses and was representative of
the operating expenses that would have been incurred had Axcelis operated on a stand-alone
basis. The consolidated statements of operations do not include an allocation of interest
expense related to Eaton's debt obligations, consistent with Eaton's internal expense
allocation methodology. </P>

<P>Commencing with the initial public offering, the Company entered into various
agreements with Eaton, which provide for transitional services and support, including
those associated with voice and data transmissions and other data-related operations,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, fixed assets, payroll, general accounting,
financial accounting consolidation, cash management, human resources, tax, legal and
real estate.  Under these agreements, the Company reimbursed Eaton for its direct and
indirect costs of providing these services until the divestiture, and thereafter, for a
limited time, the Company is reimbursing Eaton for its costs plus an additional fee for
providing certain of these additional services.  The transition periods covered by these
agreements vary, but are generally less than two years from July 10, 2000.  The agreements
do not necessarily reflect the costs of obtaining these services from unrelated third parties
or of providing the applicable services in-house.  However, management believes that continuing
to purchase certain of these services from Eaton provides an efficient means of obtaining these
services during the transition period.  Transition expenses included in Axcelis' consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 amounted to $5.5 million.</P>
<B>
</B><P>At December 31, 2000, the Company had a payable to Eaton of $25.8 million and
taxes payable of $31.2 million. The payable to Eaton arose primarily from expenditures,
such as workers'compensation claims, health claims, legal and other professional services,
and other general and administrative expenses, made by Eaton on Axcelis' behalf subsequent
to the initial public offering. Taxes payable are payable to Eaton as the former parent
will file a consolidated return for 2000, which will include Axcelis. Effective January
1, 2001, Axcelis began paying for the majority of these costs as the Company transitioned
off of Eaton's systems and support. Amounts payable to Eaton as of December 31, 2000 were
paid in January, 2001. <BR>
