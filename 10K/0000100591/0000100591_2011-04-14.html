<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Argan, Inc. (&#147;Argan&#148;) conducts operations through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Gemma Power
Systems, LLC and affiliates (&#147;GPS&#148;) that were acquired in December&nbsp;2006 and Southern Maryland
Cable, Inc. (&#147;SMC&#148;) that was acquired in July&nbsp;2003 (together referred to as the &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148;
&#147;us,&#148; or &#147;our&#148;). Through GPS, we provide a full range of development, consulting, engineering,
procurement, construction, commissioning, operations and maintenance services to the power
generation and renewable energy markets for a wide range of customers including public utilities,
independent power project owners, municipalities, public institutions and private industry. Through
SMC, we provide telecommunications infrastructure services including project management,
construction and maintenance to the federal government, telecommunications and broadband service
providers as well as electric utilities. Each of the wholly-owned subsidiaries represents a
separate reportable segment &#151; power industry services and telecommunications infrastructure
services, respectively. The net revenues of GPS represented approximately 96%, of our consolidated
net revenues from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011. Financial
information about our business segments is included in Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U><B>Discontinued Operations</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2010, the Board of Directors of Argan approved management&#146;s plan to dispose of the
operations of the nutritional products line of business conducted by its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Vitarich Laboratories, Inc. (&#147;VLI&#148;). Since 2006, VLI incurred operating results that were
consistently below expected results. The loss of certain major customers and the reduction in the
amounts of orders received from other large customers caused net revenues to decline and this
business segment to report operating losses. We reported an operating loss for VLI of approximately
$2.9&nbsp;million for the nine months ended October&nbsp;31, 2010. We reported operating losses for VLI of
approximately $2.2&nbsp;million, $6.9&nbsp;million and $8.9&nbsp;million for the fiscal years ended January&nbsp;31,
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, including impairment losses related to the indefinite-lived and
long-lived assets of approximately $2.0&nbsp;million and $6.8&nbsp;million for the fiscal years ended January
31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On March&nbsp;11, 2011, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of VLI to an unrelated
company. The asset sale was consummated for an aggregate cash purchase price of up to $3,100,000
and the assumption by the purchaser of certain trade payables, accrued expenses and remaining
obligations under VLI&#146;s facility leases. Of the cash purchase price, $800,000 was paid at closing
and the remaining $2,300,000 was placed into escrow. VLI will be paid from the escrow amount (i)
the cost of all closing inventory sold, used or consumed within nine months of the closing, and
(ii)&nbsp;the amounts of all accounts receivable of VLI that are collected by September&nbsp;30, 2011. After
September&nbsp;30, 2011, all uncollected accounts receivable will be returned to VLI. At the end of
nine months of the closing, all money still held in the escrow account will be returned to the
purchaser.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The assets and liabilities of VLI are classified as held for sale and the financial results of VLI
have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U><B>Holding Company Structure</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Argan was organized as a Delaware corporation in May&nbsp;1961. We intend to make additional
acquisitions and/or investments by identifying companies with significant potential for profitable
growth. We may have more than one industrial focus. We expect that companies acquired in each of
these industrial groups will be held in separate subsidiaries that will be operated in a manner
that best provides cash flows for the Company and value for our stockholders. Argan is a holding
company with no operations other than its continuing investments in GPS and SMC. At January&nbsp;31,
2011, there were no restrictions with respect to inter-company payments to Argan by GPS, SMC or
VLI.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U><B>Acquisition of Gemma Power Systems, LLC and its Affiliates</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We acquired GPS on December&nbsp;8, 2006. The results of operations of GPS have been included in our
consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. The acquisition purchase price
was $33.1&nbsp;million, consisting of $12.9&nbsp;million in cash and $20.2&nbsp;million from the issuance of
approximately 3,667,000 shares of our common stock. The purchase price was funded, in part, by an
$8.0&nbsp;million, secured, 4-year term loan. In addition, we raised $10.7&nbsp;million through the private
offering of approximately 2,853,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $3.75 per
share as discussed below. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, $12.0&nbsp;million in cash was
deposited into an escrow account. Of this amount, $10.0&nbsp;million secured a letter of credit
supporting the issuance of bonding. Over the past two years, the escrowed amounts have been
released to us as the bonding company reduced, and then eliminated, its security requirements.
Pursuant to the
terms of the acquisition agreement, payment of the remaining escrowed amount of $2.0&nbsp;million was
subsequently made to the former owners of GPS based on the financial performance of GPS for the
twelve months ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U><B>Financing Arrangements</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have financing arrangements with Bank of America (the &#147;Bank&#148;). The financing arrangements, as
amended, provide a revolving loan with a maximum borrowing amount of $4.25&nbsp;million that is
available until May&nbsp;31, 2011, with interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%. There were no borrowed amounts
outstanding under the revolving loan arrangement as of January&nbsp;31, 2011. We may obtain standby
letters of credit from the Bank in the ordinary course of business not to exceed $10.0&nbsp;million. We
expect that we will succeed in obtaining a renewal of the revolving loan at the expiration of the
current term.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The amended financing arrangements also covered term loans in the amounts of $8.0&nbsp;million and $1.5
million, with interest at LIBOR plus 3.25%, that were repaid during the years ended January&nbsp;31,
2011 and 2010, respectively. We used the funds borrowed from the Bank in the acquisition of GPS and
for the retirement of certain debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of VLI.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Bank requires that the Company comply with certain financial covenants at its fiscal year-end
and at each of its fiscal quarter-ends (using a rolling 12-month period) including covenants that
(1)&nbsp;the ratio of total funded debt to EBITDA not exceed 2 to 1, (2)&nbsp;the fixed charge coverage ratio
be not less than 1.25 to 1, and (3)&nbsp;the ratio of senior funded debt to EBITDA not exceed 1.50 to 1.
The Bank&#146;s consent is required for acquisitions and divestitures. We have pledged the majority of
the Company&#146;s assets to secure the financing arrangements. The amended financing arrangements
contain an acceleration clause which allows the Bank to declare outstanding borrowed amounts due
and payable if it determines in good faith that a material adverse change has occurred in the
financial condition of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. We believe that the Company will
continue to comply with its financial covenants under the financing arrangements. If the Company&#146;s
performance does not result in compliance with any of its financial covenants, or if the Bank seeks
to exercise its rights under the acceleration clause referred to above, we would seek to modify the
financing arrangements. However, there can be no assurance that the Bank would not exercise its
rights and remedies under the financing arrangements including accelerating the payment of all
outstanding senior debt. At January&nbsp;31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with the financial
covenants of its amended financing arrangements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U><B>Power Industry Services</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The extensive design, construction, start-up and operating experience of our power industry
services business has grown with the completion of projects for more than 70 facilities
representing nearly 10,000 megawatts (&#147;MW&#148;) of power-generating capacity. Power projects have
included combined-cycle cogeneration facilities, electricity peaking plants, boiler plant
construction and renovation efforts, and utility system maintenance. We have also broadened our
experience into the growing renewable energy industry by providing engineering, procurement and
construction services to the owners of wind plants and other alternative power energy facilities.
The durations of our construction projects may extend to three years. During the past two years, we
completed construction of a natural gas-fired power plant in California, two biodiesel production
plants in Texas and wind-energy farms in Washington and Illinois. The net
revenues of GPS, which represent our power industry services business segment, were $174.9&nbsp;million
for the fiscal year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011, or approximately 96% of our consolidated net revenues
from continuing operations for the year.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">GPS has signed an engineering, procurement and construction agreement with Competitive Power
Ventures, Inc. (&#147;CPV&#148;) and received a limited notice to proceed on the design and preconstruction
planning for the Sentinel Power Project. This project, currently valued in excess of $220&nbsp;million,
consists of eight simple cycle gas-fired peaking plants with a total power rating of 800 megawatts
to be located in Southern California. The project is currently expected to be completed during the
fiscal year ending January&nbsp;31, 2013. We understand that CPV recently completed the negotiation of a
power supply agreement with Southern California Edison.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We anticipate sustained demand for engineering and construction services related to the development
of new gas-fired power plants because these facilities are more efficient and produce fewer
emissions than coal-fired power plants. In addition, climate change and foreign oil dependency
concerns are driving an increase in renewable energy legislation, government incentives and
commercialization. Certain states in the U.S. are requiring that upwards of 20% of future energy be
produced from renewable energy sources in efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that are
blamed, in part, for global warming. Very large corporations as well as venture capital and other
investment firms have directed funds to the renewable energy sector.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In June&nbsp;2008, GPS entered into a business partnership with a wind-energy project development firm
for the design and construction of wind-energy farms located in the United States and Canada. The
business partners each owned 50% of the new company, Gemma Renewable Power, LLC (&#147;GRP&#148;). In
December&nbsp;2009, GPS acquired the other 50% ownership interest from its former partner and GRP became
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. GRP provides engineering, procurement and construction
services for new wind farms generating
electrical power, including the design and construction of roads, foundations, and electrical
collection systems, as well as the erection of towers, turbines and blades. During the year ended
January&nbsp;31, 2010, GRP completed a wind-farm expansion project in Illinois with a contract value of
approximately $47&nbsp;million and was awarded a contract for the design, engineering and construction
of a 90 megawatt wind energy project in Kittitas County, Washington, including the installation of
sixty (60)&nbsp;wind turbines with a value of approximately $33&nbsp;million. The latter project was
completed during the fiscal year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011. In November&nbsp;2010, we announced that GRP
had a signed a contract valued in the amount of approximately $51&nbsp;million with a subsidiary of the
wind-energy development firm referenced above for the construction of a wind energy farm in Henry
County, Illinois. This project, covering the installation of up to 134 wind turbines, is
anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of 2012. GRP will provide design services and
construction of roads, foundations, and electrical collection systems in addition to erecting
towers, turbines, and blades.

2011 and 2010, respectively, under a contract with Pacific Gas &#038; Electric Company for the
construction of a gas-fired power plant in California. The net revenues associated with this
customer represented approximately 56% and 93% of our consolidated net revenues from continuing
operations for the fiscal years ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Two other
significant customers of the power industry services business, GenConn Middletown, LLC and
Invenergy Wind Management, LLC, provided approximately 23% and 17% of the net revenues of this
business segment for the current year, which represented approximately 22% and 17% of our
consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for the current year.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Contract backlog represents the total accumulated value of projects awarded less the amount of net
revenue recognized to date on contracts at a specific point in time. We believe contract backlog is
an indicator of future net revenues and earnings potential. Although contract backlog reflects
business that we consider to be firm, cancellations or reductions may occur and may reduce contract
backlog and the future revenues of GPS. At January&nbsp;31, 2011, the Company had power industry service
contracts for the construction of three facilities, representing a total contract backlog of $291
million compared to a total contract backlog of $300&nbsp;million at January&nbsp;31, 2010.

regulations including: licensing for contractors; building codes; permitting and inspection
requirements applicable to construction projects; regulations relating to worker safety and
environmental protection; and special bidding, procurement and security clearance requirements on
government projects. Many state and local regulations governing construction require permits and
licenses to be held by individuals who have passed an examination or met other requirements. We
believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our current operations and that we are in
substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Through SMC, we provide comprehensive technology wiring and utility construction solutions to
customers in the mid-Atlantic region. We perform both inside plant and outside plant cabling
services including the structuring, cabling, terminations and connectivity that provide the
physical transport for high speed data, voice, video and security networks. The net revenues of
SMC, which represents our telecommunications infrastructure services business segment, were $7.7
million for the fiscal year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011, or approximately 4% of our consolidated net
revenues from continuing operations for the current year.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The wide range of inside plant and premises wiring services that we provide to our customers
include AutoCAD design; cable installation; equipment room and telecom closet design and build-out;
data rack and cabinet installation; raceway design and installation; and cable identification,
testing, labeling and documentation for copper, fiber optic and coax cable systems. These services
are provided primarily to federal government facilities, including cleared facilities, on a direct
and subcontract basis. Such facilities typically require regular upgrades to their wiring systems
in order to accommodate improvements in security, telecommunications and network capabilities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Services provided to our outside premises customers include trenchless directional boring and
excavation for underground communication and power networks, aerial cabling services, and the
installation of buried cable, high and low voltage electric lines, and private area outdoor
lighting systems. Our sophisticated directional boring system is electronically guided and can
place underground networks of various sizes with little or no restoration required. We use our
equipment and experienced personnel to perform the trenching, plowing and back-hoeing for
underground networks, to complete the installation of a variety of network structures, and to
restore work sites. We utilize aerial bucket trucks, digger derrick trucks and experienced
personnel to complete a variety of aerial projects. The outside premises services are primarily
provided to regional communications service providers, electric utilities and other commercial
customers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">SMC may have seasonally weaker results in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year, and may
produce stronger results in the second and third fiscal quarters. This seasonality is due to the
effect of winter weather on construction and outside plant activities as well as reduced daylight
hours and customer budgetary constraints. Certain customers tend to complete budgeted capital
expenditures before the end of the calendar year, and postpone additional expenditures until the
subsequent fiscal period.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Generally, our telecommunications infrastructure services customers supply most or all of the
materials required for a particular job and we provide the personnel, tools and equipment to
perform the installation, maintenance or repair services. However, for certain projects, we may
supply part or all of the materials required. In these instances, we are not dependent upon any
one source for the materials that we customarily utilize to complete projects. We are not presently
experiencing, nor do we anticipate experiencing, any difficulties in procuring an adequate supply
of materials.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">SMC operates in the fragmented and competitive telecommunication and infrastructure services
industry. We compete with service providers ranging from small regional companies, which service a
single market, to larger firms servicing multiple regions, as well as large national and
multi-national contractors. We believe that we compete favorably with the other companies in the
telecommunication and utility
infrastructure services industry. We intend to emphasize our high quality reputation, outstanding
customer base and highly motivated work force in competing for larger and more diverse contracts.
We believe that our high quality and well maintained fleet of vehicles and construction machinery
and equipment is essential to meet customers&#146; needs for high quality and on-time service. We are
committed to invest in our repair and maintenance capabilities to maintain the quality and life of
our equipment. Additionally, we invest annually in new vehicles and equipment.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The most significant customers of SMC for the fiscal year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 included a prime
government services contractor and a local electricity cooperative. In total, SMC recognized
approximately 53% of its net revenues for the fiscal year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 under contracts
with these two customers. However, none of SMC&#146;s customers accounted for net revenues in excess of
10% of our consolidated net revenues for the fiscal years ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 or 2010.
Historically, a major portion of SMC&#146;s revenue-producing activity each year is performed pursuant
to work orders authorized by customers under master agreements with its major customers. Near the
end of our fiscal year ended January&nbsp;31, 2010, we lost the business with the regional telephone
company as our master agreement expired without renewal. Approximately 18% of SMC&#146;s net revenues
last year was derived from projects performed for this customer. During the current year, the prime
contract that our customer had with the federal government expired pursuant to which we performed
inside services at various government installations throughout our region. The net revenues
provided by this customer represented approximately 28% and 34% of SMC&#146;s net revenues for the years
ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A significant challenge for SMC is the replacement of the business provided under the master
agreements that did not renew. SMC has had a certain amount of success in obtaining projects from
new customers over the past twelve months in the midst of a very difficult economic environment.
SMC&#146;s business plan for the fiscal year ending January&nbsp;31, 2012 is based on the continuation of
aggressive bid and proposal efforts resulting in the addition of new business. However, despite our
business development efforts, we cannot provide assurance that SMC will maintain its current level
of net revenues for the fiscal year ending January&nbsp;31, 2012.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As referenced above, a substantial number of the projects completed for SMECO, EDS and Verizon have
been completed under the terms of master agreements that include pre-negotiated labor rates or line
item prices. At January, 31, 2011 and 2010, the estimated values of unfulfilled work orders, open
customer purchase orders and projects expected to be completed under current contracts were
approximately $2.8&nbsp;million and $1.9&nbsp;million, respectively.

state and local laws and regulations including: licensing for contractors; building codes;
permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects; regulations relating to
worker safety and environmental protection; and special bidding, procurement and security clearance
requirements on government projects. Many state and local regulations governing construction
require permits and licenses to be held by individuals who have passed an examination or met other
requirements. We believe that SMC has all the licenses required to provide its services within the
region it typically conducts operations, and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable
regulatory requirements. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in
substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are committed to ensuring that the employees of each of our businesses perform their work in a
safe environment. We regularly communicate with our employees to promote safety and to instill
safe work habits. GPS and SMC each have an experienced full time safety director committed to
ensuring a safe work place, as well as compliance with applicable contracts, insurance and local
and environmental laws.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Contracts in the power and telecommunication infrastructure services industries may require
performance bonds or other means of financial assurance to secure contractual performance. If we
are unable to obtain surety bonds or letters of credit in sufficient amounts or at acceptable
rates, we might be precluded from entering into additional contracts with certain of our customers.
Under current arrangements, our Bank has committed to provide us with up to $10.0&nbsp;million in
irrevocable standby letters of credit, if needed, as collateral to support future bonding
commitments.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Our business, financial position and
future results of operations may be impacted in a materially adverse manner by risks associated
with the execution of our strategic plan and the creation of a profitable and cash-flow positive
business in a challenging economic environment, our ability to obtain capital or to obtain capital
on terms acceptable to us, the successful integration of acquired companies into our consolidated
operations, our ability to successfully manage diverse operations remotely located, our ability to
successfully compete in highly competitive industries, the successful resolution of ongoing
litigation, our dependence upon key managers and employees and our ability to retain them, and
potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results, among other risks. Before investing in our
securities, please consider the risks summarized in this paragraph and those risks discussed below.
Our future results may also be impacted by other risk factors listed from time to time in our
future filings with the SEC, including, but not limited to, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our
Quarterly Reports on <Font style="white-space: nowrap">Form 10-Q.</FONT>

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>The weak economic recovery may result in reduced demand for our products and services, and may
cause our financial position to deteriorate.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our customers may be impacted by the weak economic recovery in the United States from a depressed
housing market, constraints in the credit market and high unemployment. They may delay, curtail or
cancel proposed and existing projects; thus decreasing the overall demand for our services and
adversely impacting our liquidity. In addition, project owners may continue to experience
difficulty in raising capital for the construction of power-generation plants and renewable fuel
production facilities due to substantial limitations on the availability of credit and other
uncertainties in the credit markets. Customers may be reluctant to establish new supply
relationships as the condition of the economy causes demand for their products to be weak. In
general, if overall economic conditions do not improve steadily, the demand for our products and
services may be adversely affected.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>We may be unable to maintain our profitability.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Due primarily to the favorable operating results of GPS, we have generated income from continuing
operations for three consecutive years &#151; the fiscal years ended January&nbsp;31, 2009, 2010 and 2011.
As described in the risks presented below, our ability to maintain profitable continuing operations
depends on many factors including the ability of the power services business segment to continue to
obtain new construction projects and to complete its projects successfully. A substantial decline
in the net revenues of GPS could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve net
income in the future.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Our dependence on one or a few customers could adversely affect us.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The size of the energy plant construction projects of our power industry services segment
frequently results in a limited number of projects contributing a substantial portion of our
consolidated net revenues as described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. Should
we fail to replace projects that are completed by GPS with new projects, future net revenues and
profits may be adversely affected.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Our dependence on large construction contracts may result in uneven quarterly financial results.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our power industry service activities in any one fiscal quarter are typically concentrated on a few
large construction projects for which we use the percentage-of-completion accounting method to
determine contract revenues. To a substantial extent, construction contract revenues are
recognized as services are provided as measured by the amount of costs incurred. As the timing of
equipment purchases, subcontractor services and other contract events may not be evenly distributed
over the lives of our contracts, the amount of total contract costs may vary from quarter to
quarter, creating uneven amounts of quarterly contract net revenues. In addition, the timing of
contract commencements and completions may exacerbate the uneven pattern. As a result of the
foregoing, future amounts of consolidated net revenues, cash flow from operations, net income and
earnings per share reported on a quarterly basis may vary in an uneven pattern and may not be
indicative of the operating results expected for any other quarter or for an entire fiscal year,
thus rendering consecutive quarter comparisons of our consolidated operating results a less
meaningful way to assess the growth of our business.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Lawsuits could adversely affect our business.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">From time to time, we, our directors and/or certain of our current officers are named as a party to
lawsuits. A discussion of our significant lawsuits appears in Item&nbsp;3 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. It is not possible at this time to
predict the likely outcome of these actions with certainty, and an adverse result in any of these
lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on us. Litigation can involve complex factual and
legal questions and its outcome is uncertain. Any claim that is successfully asserted
against us could result in significant damage claims and other losses. Even if we were to prevail,
any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management
and key personnel from our business operations, which could adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are a holding company with no operations other than our investments in GPS and SMC. The
successful execution of our overall business plan could be based, in part, on our making additional
acquisitions and/or investments that would provide positive cash flow to us and value to our
stockholders. Additional companies meeting these criteria and that provide products and/or services
to growth industries and are available for purchase at attractive prices may be difficult to find.
Further, efforts to conduct due diligence investigations of attractive target companies and to
negotiate acquisition and related agreements may not be successful.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We cannot readily predict the timing or size of our acquisition efforts and therefore the capital
we will need for these efforts. However, it is likely that any potential future acquisition or
strategic investment transaction would require the use of cash and/or shares of our common stock as
components of the purchase price. Using cash for acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility
and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our
ability to obtain such additional financing in the future may depend upon prevailing capital market
conditions, the strength of our future operating results and financial condition as well as
conditions in our business; and those factors may affect our efforts to arrange additional
financing on terms that are acceptable to us. Our ability to use shares of our common stock as
future acquisition consideration may be limited by a variety of factors, including the future
market price of shares of our common stock and a potential seller&#146;s assessment of the liquidity of
our common stock. If adequate funds or the use of our common stock are not available to us, or are
not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of acquisitions or other
opportunities, to make future investments, or to respond to competitive challenges.

acquisitions could result in issuances of equity securities that would reduce our stockholders&#146;

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of additional impairment losses
related to goodwill and other purchased intangible assets.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">When we acquire a business, we record goodwill equal to the excess amount paid for the business,
including liabilities assumed, over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business.
Generally accepted accounting principles require that all business combinations be accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting and that certain intangible assets acquired in a business
combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill. The balances of goodwill and other
intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead must be tested
at least annually for impairment. The amounts of intangible assets that do have finite lives are
amortized over their useful lives. However, should poor performance or other conditions indicate
that the carrying value of a business or long-lived asset may have suffered impairment, a
determination of fair value is required to be performed in the period that such conditions are
noted. If the carrying value of a business or of an individual purchased intangible asset is found
to exceed the corresponding fair value, an impairment loss is recorded. The aggregate carrying
amount of goodwill, other purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives and long lived
purchased intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet as of January&nbsp;31, 2011 was
approximately $21.4&nbsp;million, or approximately 16.4% of total consolidated assets and 21.9% of
consolidated net assets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We perform annual impairment assessments of the carrying values of goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets as of November 1. Assessments of these assets as well as our
long-lived assets may be conducted more frequently if we identify indications of impairment. Should
the operating results of GPS or any future acquired company experience unexpected deterioration, we
could be required to record additional significant impairment losses related to purchased
intangible assets. Impairment losses, if any, would be recognized as operating expenses and would
adversely affect future profitability.

members in order to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to expand our operations or

any particular period of time. Our ability to operate productively and profitably, particularly in
the power services industry, may also be limited by our ability to attract, employ, retain and

We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain management teams and an adequate skilled
labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor
expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel.
Labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability or maintain our business or grow
our net revenues. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At January&nbsp;31, 2011, our construction contract backlog was approximately $291&nbsp;million including
approximately $224&nbsp;million related to a project to construct an eight-unit simple cycle peaking
power generation facility in Southern California that was awarded to GPS by developer of power
facilities in July&nbsp;2008, over two years ago. During the fourth quarter of the current year, the
California Energy Commission approved the construction of this power plant and the customer
informed us of the signing of a power purchase agreement. Subsequent to the end of the current
fiscal year, GPS completed renegotiations, and signed an amended engineering, procurement and
construction contract with the project owner. Although our expectation is that we will eventually
be provided with a full notice to proceed for this project, we do not know when that will occur.
Should construction work on this project not commence in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 as

particular, the engineering and construction markets are highly competitive and require substantial
resources and capital investment in equipment, technology and skilled personnel. Competition also
places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins. Intense competition is expected
to continue in these markets, presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain
strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. If we are unable to meet these competitive

occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what
they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually liable. We have been
and may in the future be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim
for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters. These claims generally
arise in the normal course of our business.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Note 12 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements describes a matter which includes a
claim in the approximate amount of $6.8&nbsp;million that a subcontractor has made against a payment
bond issued on our behalf related to a cancelled construction project. Assurance cannot be provided

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In accordance with customary industry practices, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but
not all, potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face. When it is determined that
we have liability, we may not be covered by insurance or, if covered, the dollar amount of any
liability may exceed our policy limits. Further, we may elect not to carry insurance if our
management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks
presented. In addition, we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks. Our
professional liability coverage is on a &#147;claims-made&#148; basis covering only claims actually made
during the policy period currently in effect. In addition, even where insurance is maintained for
such exposures, the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of
coverage with respect to any such claims. Any liability not covered by our insurance, in excess of
our insurance limits or, if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, could result in
a significant loss for us, which claims may reduce our future profits and cash available for
operations.

occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, both of
which may result in additional cost. Often, these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration
or litigation proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be
fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we have used
working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims.
A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a negative impact on our

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Much of the work performed under our energy plant construction contracts is actually performed by
third-party subcontractors we hire. We also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or
suppliers to provide much of the equipment included in an energy project and most of the materials
(including concrete and steel) used in our construction projects. If we are unable to hire
qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to
successfully complete a project could be impaired. If the amount we are required to pay for
subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially when we are
operating under a lump sum or a fixed-price type construction contract, we may suffer losses on
these contracts. If a supplier, manufacturer or subcontractor fails to provide supplies, equipment
or services as required under a negotiated contract for any reason, we may be required to source
these supplies, equipment or services on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated
which could impact contract profitability in an adverse manner.

additional costs to cover our guarantee obligations.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In some instances and in many of our fixed price contracts, we guarantee a customer that we will
complete a project by a scheduled date. We sometimes provide that the project, when completed, will
also achieve certain performance standards. If we subsequently fail to complete the project as
scheduled, or if the project subsequently fails to meet guaranteed performance standards, we may be
held responsible for cost impacts to the customer resulting from any delay or modifications to the
plant in order to achieve the performance standards, generally in the form of contractually
agreed-upon liquidated damages. If these events would occur, the total costs of the project would
exceed our original estimate, and we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>If financing for new energy plants is unavailable, construction of such plants may not occur.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Traditional gas-fired power plants have been constructed typically by large utility companies.
However, to a large extent, the construction of new energy plants, including alternative and
renewable energy facilities, is conducted by private investment groups. The owner of the Sentinel
project described above is Competitive Power Ventures, Inc. which is owned by Warburg Pincus,
certain individual investors and members of its management team. The challenge for these types of
project owners to secure and maintain financing in the midst of the current credit crisis continues
to be significant. Should debt financing for the construction of new energy facilities, including
alternative or renewable energy plants, not be available, investors may not be able to invest in
such projects, thereby adversely affecting the likelihood that GPS or GRP will obtain contracts to
construct such plants.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The commencement and/or execution of many of the construction projects performed by our power
industry services segment are subject to numerous regulatory permitting processes. Applications for
permits may be opposed by individuals or environmental groups, resulting in delays and possible
non-issuance of the permits. There are no assurances that our customers will obtain the necessary
permits for these projects, or that the necessary permits will be obtained in order to allow
construction work to proceed as scheduled. Failure to commence or complete construction work as
anticipated could have material adverse impacts on our future net revenues, profits and cash flows
from operations.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Our use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or
reversal of previously recorded net revenues or profits.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under our accounting procedures, we measure and recognize a large portion of our net revenues under
the percentage-of-completion accounting methodology. This methodology allows us to recognize net
revenues and contract profits ratably over the life of a contract by comparing the amount of the
costs incurred to date against the total amount of costs expected to be incurred. The effects of
revisions to net revenues and estimated costs are recorded when the amounts are known and can be
reasonably estimated, and these revisions can occur at any time and could be material. Given the
uncertainties associated with these types of contracts, it is possible for actual costs to vary
from estimates previously made, which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded
net revenues and profits.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Future bonding requirements may adversely affect our ability to compete for new energy plant
construction projects.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our construction contracts frequently require that we obtain payment and performance bonds from
surety companies on behalf of our customers as a condition to the award of such contracts. Surety
market conditions have in the last few years become more difficult as a result of significant
losses incurred by many surety companies, both in the construction industry as well as in certain
large corporate bankruptcies. Consequently, less overall bonding capacity is available in the
market than in the past, and surety bonds have become more expensive and restrictive. Historically,
we have had a strong bonding capacity but, under standard terms in the surety market, surety
companies issue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or
require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing any bonds.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Current or future market conditions, changes in our surety&#146;s assessment of its own operating and
financial risk or larger future projects could cause our surety company to decline to issue, or
substantially reduce the amount of, bonds for our work and could increase our bonding costs. These
actions can be taken on short notice. If our surety company were to limit or eliminate our access
to bonding, our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other surety companies,
joint venturing with other construction firms, increasing business with clients that do not require
bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit, or
cash. We may be unable to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or
at all. Accordingly, if we were to experience an
interruption, reduction or other alteration in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be
unable to compete for or work on certain projects.

legislation requiring that utilities include a percentage of renewable energy in the mix of power
they generate and buy. These future percentages may be as high as 20%, and the requirements are
contributing to the increased momentum of efforts to develop sources of alternative renewable

customers under long-term master service-type contracts. Near the end of our fiscal year ended
January&nbsp;31, 2010, we lost the business with Verizon as our master agreement expired without
renewal. Approximately 18% of SMC&#146;s net revenues last year was derived from projects performed for
Verizon. During the current year, the prime contract that EDS had with the federal government
expired pursuant to which we performed inside services at various government installations
throughout the mid-Atlantic region. The net revenues provided by EDS represented approximately 28%
and 34% of SMC&#146;s net revenues for the years ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A significant challenge for SMC is the replacement of the lost business provided under the

from new customers over the past twelve months and in the midst of a very difficult economic
environment. SMC&#146;s business plan for the fiscal year ending January&nbsp;31, 2012 is based on the
continuation of aggressive bid and proposal efforts resulting in the addition of new business.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Competition in the telecommunications infrastructure industry depends on a number of factors,
including price. Certain of our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures than we do and
may, therefore, be able to provide their services at lower rates than we can. In addition, some of
our competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial resources than we do. Our
competitors may develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are

to bid for these fixed price contracts. Although historically we have been able to estimate costs
accurately, the cost of labor and materials may, from time to time, vary from costs originally
estimated. These variations, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts,
may cause actual net revenues and gross profits for a project to differ
from those we originally estimated and could result in reduced profitability or losses on projects.
Depending upon the size of a particular project, variations from the estimated contract costs could

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U><B>Delta-T Matters</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">GPS was the contractor for engineering, procurement and construction services related to an
anhydrous ethanol plant in Carleton, Nebraska (the &#147;Project&#148;). The Project owner was ALTRA
Nebraska, LLC (&#147;Altra&#148;). In November&nbsp;2007, GPS and Altra agreed to a suspension of the Project
while Altra sought to obtain financing to complete the Project. By March&nbsp;2008, financing had not
been arranged which terminated the construction contract prior to completion of the Project. In
March&nbsp;2008, GPS filed a mechanic&#146;s lien against the Project in the approximate amount of $23.8
million, which amount also included all sums owed to the subcontractors/suppliers of GPS and their
subcontractors/suppliers. In August&nbsp;2009, Altra filed for bankruptcy protection. Proceedings
resulted in a court-ordered liquidation of Altra&#146;s assets. The incomplete plant was sold at auction
in October&nbsp;2009. Remaining net proceeds of approximately $5.5&nbsp;million are being held by the
bankruptcy court and have not been distributed to Altra&#146;s creditors.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Delta-T Corporation (&#147;Delta-T&#148;) was a major subcontractor to GPS on the Project. In January&nbsp;2009,
GPS and Delta-T executed a Project Close-Out Agreement (the &#147;Close-Out&#148;) which settled all contract
claims between the parties and included a settlement payment in the amount of $3.5&nbsp;million that GPS
made to Delta-T. In the Close-Out, Delta-T also agreed to prosecute any lien claims against Altra,
to assign to GPS the first $3.5&nbsp;million of any resulting proceeds and to indemnify and defend any
claims against GPS related to the Project. In addition, GPS received a guarantee from Delta-T&#146;s
parent company in support of the indemnification commitment.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In April&nbsp;2009, one of the subcontractors to Delta-T received an arbitration award in its favor
against Delta-T in the amount of approximately $6.8&nbsp;million, including approximately $662,000 in
interest and $2.3&nbsp;million identified in the award as amounts applied to other projects (the
&#147;Judgment Award&#148;). In April&nbsp;2009, the subcontractor also filed suit in the District Court of Thayer
County, Nebraska, in order to recover its claimed amount of $3.6&nbsp;million unpaid by Delta-T on the
Altra project from a payment bond issued to Altra on behalf of GPS. In December&nbsp;2009, the Judgment
Award was confirmed in federal district court in Florida. In February&nbsp;2010, the amount of the suit
in Nebraska was amended by the subcontractor to $6.8&nbsp;million, plus interest, to match the amount of
the Judgment Award. Delta-T has not paid or satisfied any portion of the award. Management
understands that Delta-T has abandoned its defense of the surety company.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We intend to pursue vigorously our lien claim against the Altra project, to defend this matter for
the surety company, to investigate the inclusion of the $2.3&nbsp;million applied to other projects in
the Judgment Award, to demand that Delta-T satisfy its obligations under the Close Out, and/or to
enforce the guarantee provided to GPS by Delta-T&#146;s parent company. Due to the early stages of these
legal proceedings, we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in these efforts. It is
reasonably possible that resolution of the matters discussed above could result in a loss with a
material negative effect on our consolidated operating results in a future reporting period.
However, at this time, we cannot make an estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, related
to these matters. No provision for loss has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements
as of January&nbsp;31, 2011 related to these matters. If new facts become known in the future indicating
that it is probable that a loss has been incurred by GPS and the amount of loss can be reasonably
estimated by GPS, the impact of the change will be reflected in the consolidated financial
statements at that time.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On or about September&nbsp;19, 2007, Tampa Bay Nutraceutical Company, Inc. (&#147;Tampa Bay&#148;) filed a civil
action in the Circuit Court of Florida for Collier County against VLI. The current causes of action
relate to an order for product issued by Tampa Bay to VLI in June&nbsp;2007 and sound in (1)&nbsp;breach of
contract; (2)&nbsp;promissory estoppel; (3)&nbsp;fraudulent misrepresentation; (4)&nbsp;negligent
misrepresentation; (5)&nbsp;breach of express warranty; (6)&nbsp;breach of implied warranty of
merchantability; (7)&nbsp;breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose; and (8)
non-conforming goods. Tampa Bay alleges compensatory damages in excess of $42&nbsp;million. Depositions
are ongoing. We are vigorously defending this litigation. Although we believe that the Company has
meritorious defenses, it is impracticable to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of a
trial or to estimate a likely range of potential damages, if any, at this stage of the litigation.
The ultimate resolution of the litigation with Tampa Bay could result in a material adverse effect
on the results of operations of the Company for a future reporting period.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In response to VLI&#146;s lawsuit filed against Beveragette Ventures LLC (&#147;Beveragette&#148;), representing a
claim for unpaid invoices, Beveragette, a former customer, filed a counterclaim in the United
States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Fort Myers Division, against VLI on or
about September&nbsp;23, 2010. The causes of action related to orders for product issued by Beveragette
to VLI in 2009 and were based on a series of allegations including breach of contract by VLI.
Beveragette claimed that it suffered damages in excess of $4&nbsp;million as a result of lost sales due
to the supply by VLI of non-conforming product and also sought punitive damages. In December&nbsp;2010,
the parties settled this matter, with VLI making a settlement payment in the amount of $65,000, and
provided each other with a full and final release of all claims. As a result, each lawsuit has been
dismissed with prejudice.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As of April&nbsp;1, 2011, we had approximately 145 stockholders of record.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">To date, we have not declared or paid cash dividends to our stockholders. We have no plans to
declare and pay cash dividends in the near future as we plan to use the Company&#146;s working capital
in growing our business operations.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company&#146;s 2001 Stock Option Plan was established in August&nbsp;2001 (the &#147;Option Plan&#148;). Under the
Option Plan, our Board of Directors may grant stock options to officers, directors and key
employees. The Option Plan was amended in June&nbsp;2008 in order to authorize the grant of options for
up to 1,150,000 shares of common stock. Stock options that are granted may be Incentive Stock
Options (&#147;ISOs&#148;) or nonqualified stock options&#148; (&#147;NSOs&#148;). ISOs granted under the Option Plan have
an exercise price per share at least equal to the common stock&#146;s fair market value per share at the
date of grant, a ten-year term, and typically become fully exercisable one year from the date of
grant. NSOs may be granted at an exercise price per share that differs from the common stock&#146;s fair
market value per share at the date of grant, may have up to a ten-year term, and become exercisable
as determined by the Board of Directors.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In connection with the Company&#146;s private placement offering of our common stock that occurred in
April&nbsp;2003, we also issued warrants to purchase 230,000 shares of common stock to various parties.
Included were (1)&nbsp;warrants to purchase an aggregate of 180,000 shares of common stock that were
issued to three individuals (including the current CEO and CFO) who became executive officers of
the Company upon completion of the offering, and (2)&nbsp;warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of common
stock that were issued to MSR Advisors, Inc. (one of the members of our Board of Directors is the
President of MSR Advisors, Inc.). The purchase price per share of common stock under all of these
warrants is $7.75 and the warrants expire in December&nbsp;2012. As of January&nbsp;31, 2011, warrants to
purchase 163,000 shares of common stock were outstanding.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Argan, Inc. (the &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; or &#147;our&#148;) conducts continuing operations through our
wholly-owned subsidiaries, Gemma Power Systems, LLC and affiliates (&#147;GPS&#148;) that we acquired in
December&nbsp;2006, and Southern Maryland Cable, Inc. (&#147;SMC&#148;) that we acquired in July&nbsp;2003. Through
GPS, we provide a full range of development, consulting, engineering, procurement, construction,
commissioning, operations and maintenance services to the power generation and renewable energy
markets for a wide range of customers including public utilities, independent power project owners,
municipalities, public institutions and private industry. Through SMC, we provide
telecommunications infrastructure services including project management, construction and
maintenance to the federal government, telecommunications and broadband service providers as well
as electric utilities. Each of the wholly-owned subsidiaries represents a separate reportable
segment &#151; power industry services and telecommunications infrastructure services, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U><B>Overview and Outlook</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">For the fiscal year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011, consolidated net revenues from continuing operations
were $182.6&nbsp;million, which represented a decrease of $35.7&nbsp;million, or 16.4%, from consolidated net
revenues from continuing operations of $218.3&nbsp;million for the fiscal year ended January&nbsp;31, 2010.
Despite the decline between years in consolidated net revenues, income from continuing operations
for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 was $10.0&nbsp;million, or $0.73 per diluted share, compared with
income from continuing operations of $8.3&nbsp;million, or $0.60 per diluted share, for the year ended
January&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The decrease in consolidated net revenues for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011, compared with the
consolidated net revenues for the prior year, was due primarily to a decrease of 16.6% in the net
revenues of the power industry services business, which represented 96% of consolidated net
revenues from continuing operations for the current year. However, the gross profit of the power
industry services segment increased by $7.1&nbsp;million to $28.0&nbsp;million, or 34.2%, for the current
year compared with the amount of gross profit last year. This increase was offset slightly by a
decline of $727,000 in the profitability of the telecommunications infrastructure services
businesses. Last year&#146;s results included income related to the unconsolidated subsidiary in the
total amount of $2.2&nbsp;million. As a result, income from continuing operations before income taxes
increased by $4.2&nbsp;million to $17.0&nbsp;million for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 from $12.8&nbsp;million
for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The cash and cash equivalents increased by $17.1&nbsp;million during the current year to $83.3&nbsp;million
at January&nbsp;31, 2011. Our operating activities from continuing operations provided $22.2&nbsp;million of
cash including income from continuing operations in the amount of $10.0&nbsp;million, noncash charges in
the amount of $2.9&nbsp;million and a net favorable change in working capital accounts in the amount of
$9.3&nbsp;million. We used cash in discontinued operations of approximately $2.9&nbsp;million. We also used
cash in the total amount of $2.3&nbsp;million to retire our bank debt and to make capital expenditures.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At January&nbsp;31, 2011, the value of our construction contract backlog was $291&nbsp;million compared with
a backlog value of $300&nbsp;million as of January&nbsp;31, 2010. During the current year, we signed a
construction and start-up services contract, now valued at approximately $56&nbsp;million, for the
construction of a 200 megawatt peaking power plant in Connecticut and received the related full
notice-to-proceed. The completion of the project, which includes the installation of four gas
turbines with ancillary equipment and systems, is expected to occur during the second quarter of
fiscal year 2012. During the current year, the Company also was awarded a contract, valued at
approximately $51&nbsp;million, by a wind-energy power project development firm for the design and
construction of a 200 megawatt wind energy project in Henry County, Illinois. The scope of this
project includes the design and construction of roads, foundations, and electrical collection
systems in addition to erecting one hundred thirty-four (134)&nbsp;sets of towers, turbines, and blades.
This project has a planned completion date in the first quarter of 2012. During the current year,
we substantially completed the construction of a gas-fired power plant in northern California that
represented approximately $60&nbsp;million in contract backlog at January&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The renegotiation of our engineering, procurement and construction contract for the construction of
a gas-fired electricity peaking facility in Southern California added in excess of $10&nbsp;million to
the total value of our backlog. Substantial commencement of this project is expected to occur in
the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. This project was awarded to us over two years ago. During
the fourth quarter of the current year, the California Energy Commission approved the construction
of this power plant and the customer informed us of the signing of a power purchase agreement.
Although our expectation is that we will be provided with full notice to proceed for this project,
we do not know when that will occur. Should construction work on this project not commence soon,
our results of operations for fiscal year 2012 may be adversely affected, perhaps in a material
way. We cannot provide assurance that the future net revenues associated with this project will
ever be recognized.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Current economic conditions in the United States, which reflect a weak recovery from the recession
and continued disruptions in the credit markets, are likely to adversely affect us through at least
a large portion of next year, particularly if the depressed state of the construction industry is
prolonged or if the continuing government efforts to stabilize financial institutions, to restore
order to credit markets, to stimulate spending and to reduce high unemployment are not effective.
The current instability in the financial markets may continue to make it difficult for certain of
our customers, particularly for projects funded by private investment, to access the credit markets
to obtain financing for new construction projects on satisfactory terms or at all. As a result, we
may encounter deferrals, delays and cancellations related to new construction projects in the
future which could result in a decrease in the overall demand for our services. In addition, we may
encounter requirements in the future to make investments in a new project as a condition of EPC
contract award. The sharp reduction in the number of new commercial, industrial and infrastructure
construction projects has created an extremely competitive bid environment. Many known competitors
are reducing prices, willing to sacrifice margin in order to keep work crews busy. Other
construction companies are entering our sector of the industry looking for new work at low margins.
If we are unsuccessful in continuing to add projects to our backlog, our results of operations for
the year ending January&nbsp;31, 2012 may be adversely affected and our financial condition may be
weakened. These uncertain economic conditions are impairing our visibility to an unusual degree.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The expected current year increase in momentum towards more environmentally friendly power
generation facilities has not occurred. The federal government has also failed to enact
comprehensive energy legislation, including incentives for the retirement of existing coal burning
power plants and caps on the volume of carbon emissions. This appears even less likely for the
foreseeable future with the recent change in the majority control of the U.S. House of
Representatives. The majority political party does not support federal government subsidies and
incentives for the development of sources of renewable power. Although certain coal-fired power
plants have been shut down, existing coal plants are proving to be a challenge to retrofit or
replace. Coal prices are widely considered to be stable and certain states see the availability of
inexpensive, coal-fired electricity as a key driver of economic growth. In addition, with the fate
of renewable energy tax incentives unknown, potential energy project developers and investors are
hesitant to make commitments related to new renewable energy generation facilities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">An effect of the recession was a two-year decline in the demand for power in the United States, the
first time this occurred in more than a century. It will likely take at least several years for
power consumption to reach 2007 peak levels. As a result, existing power plants will continue to
operate with spare capacity to produce additional electricity. Despite the reductions in the demand
for power, certain regions of the country continued to add power generation facilities over the
last two years, wind energy facilities in particular. The combination of new power generation
plants and excess generation capacity elsewhere may obviate the need to build power plants during
this power demand recovery period.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Ultimately, we expect that the negative environmental impact of burning coal, concerns about the
safety of nuclear power facilities and political focus on energy independence will spur the
development of alternative and renewable power facilities which should result in new power facility
construction opportunities for us in the future. More than half of the states have adopted formal
renewable energy portfolio standards and there is federal support for infrastructure spending.
These trends should also lead to additional coal plant shutdowns, and an increase in the demand for
not only renewable power generation, but new gas-fired power plants as well.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We continue to observe interest in gas-fired generation as electric utilities and independent power
producers look to diversify their power generation options. We believe that the initiatives in many
states to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other &#147;greenhouse gases,&#148; and utilities&#146; desire to
fill demand for additional power prior to the completion of more sizeable or controversial
projects, will stimulate demand for gas-fired power plants. The current year projects in California
and Connecticut, and the backlog peaking plant project referred to above, are all gas-fired
electricity-generation plants. In addition, gas-fired generation of electricity has the potential
to complement wind, solar and other alternative generation facilities because gas-fired facilities
can be brought on-line quickly to smooth the inherently variable generation pattern of these
alternative energy sources. We would also expect power producers to increase future capital
spending on gas-fired power plants to take advantage of recent lower natural gas prices and the
prospect that these prices may remain stable for some time because of gas field development
projects in the United States, as well as potential liquefied natural gas imports. While it is
unclear what the future impact of economic conditions might have on the timing or financing of
future projects, we expect that gas-fired power plants will continue to be an important component
of long-term power generation development in the United States and believe our capabilities and
expertise will position us as a market leader for these projects.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In summary, it is uncertain what impacts the general economic conditions and the aftereffects of
the financial/credit crisis in the United States may ultimately have on our business. We are
focused on the effective and efficient completion of our current construction projects and the
control of costs, which resulted in favorable profit and cash flow results for the current year.
Despite the intensely competitive business environment, we are committed to the rational pursuit of
new construction projects. This approach may result in a low volume of new business bookings until
the demand for new power generation facilities and the other construction industry sectors recover
fully. In the meantime, we will conserve cash and strive to maintain an overall strong balance
sheet.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We remain cautiously optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities. We are focused on
expanding our position in the growing power markets where we expect investments to be made based on
forecasts of increasing electricity demand covering decades into the future. We believe that our
expectations are reasonable and that our future plans are based on reasonable assumptions.
However, such forward-looking statements, by their nature, involve risks and uncertainties, and
they should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors included elsewhere in this 2011
Annual Report.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2010, our Board of Directors approved management&#146;s plan to dispose of the operations of
the nutritional products line of business conducted by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Vitarich
Laboratories, Inc. (&#147;VLI&#148;). Since 2006, VLI incurred operating results that were consistently below
expected results. The loss of certain major customers and the reduction in the amounts of orders
received from other large customers caused net revenues to decline and this business segment to
report operating losses. The Board of Directors considered that, despite turnaround efforts, VLI
incurred an operating loss of approximately $2.9&nbsp;million for the nine months ended October&nbsp;31,
2010. We reported operating losses for VLI of approximately $2.2&nbsp;million, $6.9&nbsp;million and $8.9
million for the fiscal years ended January&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, including
impairment losses related to the indefinite-lived and long-lived assets of approximately $2.0
million and $6.8&nbsp;million for the fiscal years ended January&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On March&nbsp;11, 2011, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of VLI to an unrelated
company. The asset sale was consummated for an aggregate cash purchase price of up to $3,100,000
and the assumption by the purchaser of certain trade payables, accrued expenses and remaining
obligations under VLI&#146;s facility leases. Of the cash purchase price, $800,000 was paid at closing
and the remaining $2,300,000 was placed into escrow. VLI will be paid from the escrow amount as
purchased inventory is used in production or sold and purchased accounts receivable are collected.
At the end of nine months of the closing, all money still held in the escrow account will be
returned to the purchaser. Including additional loss from operations, we expect the disposition to
result in income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations in the range of $700,000 loss to $300,000
income for the fiscal year ending January&nbsp;31, 2012.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The assets and liabilities of VLI as of January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010 are classified as held for sale
and the financial results of VLI have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. The losses from discontinued operations for the years ended
January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010 were $2.2&nbsp;million, or $0.16 per diluted share, and $1.3&nbsp;million, or $0.09
per diluted share, respectively. Cash used in the discontinued operations of VLI for the years
ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010 was $2.9&nbsp;million and $2.2&nbsp;million, respectively.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The net revenues of the power industry services business decreased by $34.9&nbsp;million, or 16.6%, to
$174.9&nbsp;million for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 compared with net revenues of $209.8&nbsp;million for
the prior year. The net revenues of this business represented approximately 96% of consolidated net
revenues from continuing operations for both the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 and the year ended
January&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The operating results of the power industry services segment for the current fiscal year reflected
a decline in activity on this segment&#146;s largest current project as it moved into the commissioning
phase. Net revenues related to this project, a gas-fired power plant located in Southern
California, represented 58.9% and 56.5% of power industry services net revenues and consolidated
net revenues from continuing operations for the current year, respectively, and was substantially
completed at January&nbsp;31, 2011. A year ago, the net revenues related to this project represented
96.2% and 92.4% of segment net revenues and consolidated net revenues from continuing operations,
respectively. Construction activity on the gas-fired peaking plant under construction in
Connecticut provided net revenues representing 23.4% and 22.4% of power industry services net
revenues and consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for the current year,
respectively. Construction activities related to wind-energy farms provided approximately 17% of
the net revenues of the segment and continuing operations for the current year.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The telecommunications infrastructure services business of SMC is challenged by the depressed state
of commercial and residential construction activity in the mid-Atlantic region. As a result, net
revenues for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 decreased to $7.7&nbsp;million compared with net revenues
of $8.5&nbsp;million for the prior year, representing a 10.1% decrease between years. The net revenues
of this business represented approximately 4% of consolidated net revenues from continuing
operations for the years ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Net revenues related to the performance of outside premises activities increased to approximately
48.9% of this segment&#146;s business for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 from approximately 47.3% of
this segment&#146;s net revenues for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2010 due primarily to the amount of work
performed under a contract, awarded during the current year, with a local government for the
installation of battery systems designed to provide prolonged power for traffic signals during
electricity outages, including material purchases, and under a subcontract for both outside and
inside plant services on a large commercial building construction project. SMC also experienced an
increase in net revenues from its long-time local electricity cooperative customer. We experienced
an increase in the number of work orders for maintenance and repair services issued by and
completed pursuant to our master agreement with this customer. As a result, this segment was able
to offset substantially the effect of net revenues lost under a services contract with the regional
telecommunications service provider that expired at the end of December&nbsp;2009. This business
represented approximately 17.7% of the net revenues of SMC for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Net revenues related to the performance of inside premises cabling activities declined by
approximately 13% between years. SMC&#146;s second largest customer had a prime contract with the
federal government that expired during the current year. On a subcontractor basis for this
customer, we performed inside services at various government installations throughout our region.
The net revenues provided by this customer represented approximately 28.0% and 34.0% of SMC&#146;s net
revenues for the years ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">SMC&#146;s business plan for the new fiscal year is based on the continuation of aggressive bid and
proposal efforts resulting in the addition of new business. However, despite our business
development efforts, we cannot provide assurance that SMC will maintain its current level of net
revenues for the fiscal year ending January&nbsp;31, 2012.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Cost of Revenues</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Due primarily to the decline in consolidated net revenues for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011
compared with the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2010, the consolidated cost of revenues also declined.
These costs were $153.5&nbsp;million and $195.6&nbsp;million for the years ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively, representing a decrease of approximately $42.1&nbsp;million between the years, or 21.5%.
The overall gross profit percentage for the current year improved to 15.9% from 10.4% last year due
primarily to the change in the mix of projects performed for power industry services customers
during the current year as described above. The margin percentages associated with projects
commenced in the current year, which together represented slightly in excess of 41% of this
segment&#146;s net revenues for the current year, are more favorable than the overall margin percentage
experienced on the gas-fired power plant construction project located in California which was the
primary project underway last year.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The cost of revenues for the power industry services business of GPS decreased for the year ended
January&nbsp;31, 2011 to $147.0&nbsp;million from $189.0&nbsp;million for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2010.
Moreover, the cost of revenues as a percentage of corresponding net revenues decreased to 84.0% for
the current year from 90.1% last year. The decrease in this percentage in the current year was due
primarily to the types of costs incurred on our largest construction project for the year, as this
project neared its completion, and the improved gross profit on newer projects underway during the
current year.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">For SMC, the cost of revenues, expressed as a percentage of corresponding net revenues, increased
to 84.8% for the current year from 77.8% last year due primarily to a change in the mix of
customers contributing to net revenues between the years.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Selling, General and Administrative Expenses</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">These costs increased by $130,000, or 1.1%, to approximately $12.1&nbsp;million for the current year
from approximately $12.0&nbsp;million last year. The increase in stock option compensation expense of
approximately $462,000 and the increase in salaries and benefits costs of $339,000 (due to the
consolidation of GRP) were substantially offset by a reduction of $575,000 between years in the
amount of bonus expense.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Included in these results last year was our share of the earnings of GRP, a 50% owned subsidiary
until December&nbsp;2009, of approximately $1,288,000 and the gain of $877,000 realized in connection
with the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest whereby GRP became a wholly-owned

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">For the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011, we incurred income tax expense related to continuing
operations of $7.0&nbsp;million reflecting an annual effective income tax rate of 41.3% which differed
from the expected federal income tax rate of 34% due primarily to the unfavorable effects of state
income taxes and income tax return to provision true-up adjustments in the approximate amount of
$338,000. For the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2010, we incurred income tax expense of $4.5&nbsp;million
reflecting an effective annual income tax rate of 35.2% which differed from the expected federal
income tax rate of 34% due primarily to the effect of state income tax expense offset substantially
by the favorable tax effects of permanent differences including the domestic manufacturing
deduction. For the current year, the favorable income tax effect of the domestic manufacturing
deduction was substantially offset by the unfavorable effect of nondeductible stock option and
other compensation expenses.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The balance of cash and cash equivalents increased by $17.1&nbsp;million during the current year to a
balance of $83.3&nbsp;million as of January&nbsp;31, 2011 compared with a balance of $66.2&nbsp;million as of
January&nbsp;31, 2010. Last year, cash and cash equivalents declined by $8.5&nbsp;million. The changes
between the years in the mix and status of the power plant construction projects under construction
by GPS was a significant factor in the improvement in cash flows for the year ended January&nbsp;31,
2011.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Consolidated working capital increased during the current year to $73.2&nbsp;million as of January&nbsp;31,
2011 from approximately $63.4&nbsp;million as of January&nbsp;31, 2010. We also have an available balance of
$4.25&nbsp;million under our revolving line of credit financing arrangement with Bank of America (the
&#147;Bank&#148;). In March&nbsp;2010, the Bank agreed to extend the expiration date of the line of credit to May
2011. Management expects that it will succeed in obtaining a renewal of the line of credit at the
expiration of the current term.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">For the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011, net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $22.2
million. We reported income from continuing operations of approximately $10.0&nbsp;million for the
current year. The amount of non-cash adjustments to income from continuing operations for the
current year represented a net source of cash of approximately $2.9&nbsp;million, including stock
compensation expense of $1,502,000 amortization and depreciation of $992,000 and deferred income
tax expense of $410,000. During the current year, the increase in accounts receivable represented a
$10.4&nbsp;million use of cash as construction activity increased for the gas-fired power peaking
facility under construction in Connecticut. However, the allowable billings on this project have
included amounts covering forecasted short-term costs resulting in an increase during the current
year in billings in excess of actual costs and estimated earnings as well. This increase represents
a source of cash in the amount of $8.0&nbsp;million. The decrease in activity on the gas-fired power
plant located in California was the primary cause of the decreases in costs and estimated earnings
in excess of billings and accounts payable and accrued expenses which represented net cash amounts
of $11.5&nbsp;million and $5.1&nbsp;million provided by and used in operating activities during the current
year, respectively. During the current year, we also reduced the amount of cash subject to
restrictions as described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, providing net cash in
the amount of $3.8&nbsp;million. Reflecting cash used by the discontinued operations of VLI in the
amount of $2.9&nbsp;million, net cash provided by operations was $19.3&nbsp;million for the current year.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Last year, despite reporting income from continuing operations of approximately $8.3&nbsp;million, we
used net cash in continuing operations in the amount of $10.7&nbsp;million. We experienced changes in
the amounts of several operating asset and liability accounts that represented uses of cash due
primarily to the timing of billings on the California power plant construction project as activity
on this project increased during the year. An increase in the amount of costs and estimated
earnings in excess of billings and a decrease in the amount of billings in excess of costs and
estimated earnings represented uses of cash in the amounts of $6.6&nbsp;million and $3.5&nbsp;million,
respectively. We also used cash last year to make payments reducing the amount of accounts payable
and accrued liabilities by $21.7&nbsp;million. Net cash amounts of $8.7&nbsp;million and $5.0&nbsp;million were
provided by decreases in the balances of accounts receivable and restricted cash, respectively.
Non-cash adjustments to income from continuing operations represented a net source of cash in the
amount of $150,000 last year, including stock compensation expense of $1,040,000 amortization and
depreciation of $967,000 and deferred income tax expense of $308,000. These amounts were
substantially offset by two items included in income from continuing operations without providing
cash &#151; the equity in the earnings of the unconsolidated subsidiary in the amount of $1,288,000 and
the gain realized on the bargain purchase of the remaining ownership interest in this entity in the
amount of $877,000. Cash used by the discontinued operations of VLI in the amount of $2.2&nbsp;million
was reflected in net cash used in operations in the amount of $12.8&nbsp;million last year.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011, we used net cash in connection with financing and investing
activities in the amounts of $1,715,000 and $483,000, respectively, due primarily to principal
payments made during the year to retire our remaining term note with the Bank totaling $1,833,000
and the net purchases of property plant and equipment by continuing operations in the amount of
$487,000.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2010, net cash was used in connection with financing activities
in the amount of $1,564,000 as we used cash to make principal payments on long-term debt totaling
$2,301,000, and received cash proceeds from the exercise of stock warrants and options in the
amount of $737,000. Exercises of stock options and warrants provided net cash proceeds of only
$118,000 during the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011. Prior year investing activities provided net cash
in the amount of $5,861,000. The acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in GRP
resulted in the net addition of $5,981,000 in cash. Capital expenditures made last year by
continuing operations used $190,000 in net cash.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The financing arrangements with the Bank provide for the measurement at our fiscal year-end and at
each of our fiscal quarter-ends (using a rolling 12-month year) of certain financial covenants,
determined on a consolidated basis, including requirements that the ratio of total funded debt to
EBITDA (as defined) not exceed 2 to 1, that the ratio of senior funded debt to EBITDA (as defined)
not exceed 1.50 to 1, and that the fixed charge coverage ratio not be less than 1.25 to 1. At
January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, we were in compliance with each of these financial covenants. The Bank&#146;s
consent is required for acquisitions and divestitures. We have pledged the majority of the
Company&#146;s assets to secure the financing arrangements. The amended financing arrangement contains
an acceleration clause which allows the Bank to declare amounts outstanding under the financing
arrangements due and payable if it determines in good faith that a material adverse change has
occurred in the financial condition of any of our companies. We believe that the Company will
continue to comply with its financial covenants under the financing arrangement. If the Company&#146;s
performance results in our noncompliance with any of the financial covenants, or if the Bank seeks
to exercise its rights under the acceleration clause referred to above, we would seek to modify the
financing arrangement, but there can be no assurance that the Bank would not exercise its rights
and remedies under the financing arrangement including accelerating payment of any outstanding
senior debt due and payable. Subsequent to January&nbsp;31, 2011, we received the required consent from
the Bank in order to complete the disposition of substantially all of the assets of VLI.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At January&nbsp;31, 2011, most of the balance of cash and cash equivalents was invested in money market
funds sponsored by an investment division of the Bank. Our operating and restricted bank accounts
are maintained with the Bank. We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from our future
operations and funds available under our line of credit will be adequate to meet our general
business needs in the foreseeable future without deterioration of working capital. Any future
acquisitions, or other significant unplanned cost or cash requirement, may require us to raise
additional funds through the issuance of debt and/or equity securities. There can be no assurance
that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If additional funds are
raised by issuing equity securities, significant dilution to the existing stockholders may result.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U><B>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We maintain a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide
support for various commercial provisions in the engineering, procurement and construction
contracts.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In the ordinary course of business, our customers may request that we obtain surety bonds in
connection with construction contract performance obligations that are not required to be recorded
in our consolidated balance sheets. We would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of our surety
bonds for any payments made. Each of our commitments under performance bonds generally ends
concurrently with the expiration of the related contractual obligation. If necessary, we may obtain
standby letters of credit from the Bank in the ordinary course of business, not to exceed $10.0
million. The financial crisis associated with the recession has not disrupted our insurance or
surety programs or limited our ability to access needed insurance or surety capacity. We also have
a line of credit committed by the Bank in the amount of $4.25&nbsp;million for general purposes.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">From time to time, we provide guarantees related to our services or work. If our services under a
guaranteed project would be determined to have resulted in a material defect or other material
deficiency, then we may be responsible for monetary damages or other legal remedies. When
sufficient information about claims on guaranteed projects would be available and monetary damages
or other costs or losses would be determined to be probable, we would record such guarantee losses.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We believe that Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (&#147;EBITDA&#148;) is a
meaningful presentation that enables us to assess and compare our operating cash flow performance
on a consistent basis by removing from our operating results the impacts of our capital structure,
the effects of the accounting methods used to compute depreciation and amortization and the effects
of operating in different income tax jurisdictions. Further, we believe that EBITDA is widely used
by investors and analysts as a measure of performance.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States (&#147;US GAAP&#148;), we do not believe that this measure should
be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the results of our operations presented in
accordance with US GAAP that are included in our consolidated financial statements. In addition,
our EBITDA does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not
necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.

accounting policies are those related to the areas where we have made what we consider to be

significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions. These
estimates, judgments, and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity

reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates
on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the

contracts may vary and include agreements under which net revenues are based on a fixed-price or
cost-plus-fee basis. Net revenues from cost-plus-fee construction agreements are recognized on the
basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned, measured using the cost-to-cost
method. Net revenues from fixed-price construction contracts are recognized on the
percentage-of-completion method<I>. </I>The percentage-of-completion method measures the ratio of costs
incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at
completion. This requires us to prepare on-going estimates of the costs to complete each contract
as the project progresses. In preparing these estimates, we make significant judgments and
assumptions concerning our significant costs, including materials, labor and equipment, and we
evaluate contingencies based on possible schedule variances, production delays or other
productivity factors.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Actual costs may vary from the costs we estimate. Variations from estimated contract costs along
with other risks inherent in fixed-price contracts may result in actual net revenues and gross
profits differing from those we estimate and could result in losses on projects. If a current
estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in
full when determined, without regard to the percentage of completion. We review the estimate of
total cost on each significant contract monthly. We consider unapproved change orders to be
contract variations on which we have customer approval for scope change, but not for price
associated with that scope change. These costs are included in the estimated cost to complete the
contracts and are expensed as incurred. We recognize net revenue equal to cost incurred on
unapproved change orders when realization of price approval is probable and the estimated amount is
equal to or greater than our cost related to the unapproved change order and the related margin
when the change order is formally approved by the customer. Net revenue recognized on unapproved
change orders is included in contract costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on
uncompleted contracts on the consolidated balance sheet. Depending on the size of a particular
project, variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating
results for any fiscal quarter or year. Changes to the total estimated contract cost of a
fixed-price contract may affect the amount of profit or the extent of loss. We believe our exposure
to losses on fixed price contracts is limited by management&#146;s experience in estimating contract
costs and in making early identification of unfavorable variances as work progresses.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In connection with the acquisitions of GPS, VLI and SMC, we recorded substantial amounts of
goodwill and other purchased intangible assets including contractual and other customer
relationships, proprietary formulas, non-compete agreements and trade names. Other than goodwill,
most of our purchased intangible assets were determined to have finite useful lives. At February&nbsp;1,
2010, the beginning of our most recent fiscal year, the total carrying value of goodwill and the
remaining purchased intangible asset with an indefinite life totaled approximately $18.7&nbsp;million,
which represented approximately 14% of consolidated total assets. This amount included $18.5
million in goodwill related to the acquisition of GPS.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company reviews for impairment, at least annually, the carrying values of goodwill and other
purchased intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life. The annual review performance date
is November 1. We also perform tests for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite lives more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset value
might be impaired.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As prescribed by current accounting guidance, we determine whether goodwill has been impaired or
not using a two-step process of analysis. The first step of our goodwill impairment testing process
is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its
carrying amount, including goodwill. We utilized the assistance of a professional appraisal firm in
the determination of the fair value of Gemma as of November&nbsp;1, 2010. A variety of alternative
valuation approaches were considered. As a result of the analysis, we concluded that the market
multiple and the discounted cash flow analysis approaches were the most appropriate valuation
techniques for this exercise.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">For the market multiple valuation, a fair value estimate for GPS was determined based on an
evaluation of the market values of a selected number of reasonably similar publicly traded
companies. A separate estimate was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. Projected cash
flows for GPS were developed based on its historical financial performance, a short-term projection
of operating results based on the existing backlog of current business and the assumed addition of
certain identified future projects, and published projected growth rates for the power construction
industry. The projected cash flow amounts were discounted to present value based on rates of return
which were determined considering prevalent rates of return, business risks for the industry and
risks specifically related to GPS. A 50/50 weighting was applied to the results of the market
multiple valuation and the discounted cash flow analysis of fair value in order to arrive at an
average amount considered the fair value of GPS.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As a result of this valuation, we concluded that the fair value of the net assets of GPS
substantially exceeded its carrying amount. Therefore, the goodwill of GPS was deemed not to be
impaired, and the performance of step two of the impairment assessment process was not required.
Using a discounted cash flow analysis, we determined that the fair value of our other
indefinite-live asset, the trade name of SMC, exceeded the corresponding carrying value of $181,000
at November&nbsp;1, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Long-Lived Assets</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our long-lived assets consist primarily of equipment used in our operations. Fixed assets are
carried at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, ranging from five to twenty
years, using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for
tax reporting purposes. The carrying value of certain long-lived assets is evaluated periodically
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or a
group of assets may not be recoverable. If events and circumstances such as poor operating results
of the applicable business segment indicate that the asset(s) should be reviewed for possible
impairment, we use projections to assess whether future cash flows, including disposition, on a
non-discounted basis related to the tested assets are likely to exceed the recorded carrying amount
of the assets to determine if an impairment exists. If we identify a potential impairment, we will
estimate the fair value of the assets through known market transactions of similar equipment and
other valuation techniques, which could include the use of similar projections on a discounted
basis. We will report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the impaired assets exceeds
their fair value.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Deferred Tax Assets</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As of January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, our consolidated balance sheets included net deferred tax assets
in the total amounts of $1.1&nbsp;million and $1.6&nbsp;million, respectively, resulting from our future
deductible temporary differences. In assessing whether deferred tax assets may be realizable, we
consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. Our ability to realize our deferred tax assets depends primarily upon the
generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of our deductible
temporary differences and tax planning strategies. If such estimates and assumptions change in the
future, we may be required to record valuation allowances against some or all of the deferred tax
assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations. At
this time, we believe that the strong earnings performance of our power industry services business
segment will continue during the periods in which the applicable temporary income tax differences
become deductible. Accordingly, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the
benefit of our net deferred tax assets. The amounts of income from operations before income taxes
for this business segment were $21.6&nbsp;million and $16.5&nbsp;million for the fiscal years ended January
31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Stock Options</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We measure the cost of equity compensation to our employees and independent directors based on the
estimated grant-date fair value of the awards and recognize the corresponding expense amounts over
the vesting periods. Options to purchase 237,000 and 123,000 shares of our common stock were
awarded during the years ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, with weighted average fair
value per share amounts of $6.31 and $7.21, respectively. The amounts of compensation expense
recorded during the years ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010 related to vesting stock options were
$1.5&nbsp;million and $1.0&nbsp;million, respectively. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to
compute the fair value of stock options. The Black-Scholes model requires the use of highly
subjective assumptions in the computations which are disclosed in Note 13 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and include the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility
of the market price of our common stock and the expected life of the stock option. We use of a
&#147;simplified method&#148; in developing
the estimates of the expected lives of stock options, as we believe that our historical stock
option exercise experience is insufficient to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate
expected lives. Changes in these assumptions can cause significant fluctuations in the fair value
of stock option awards.

procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#147;US GAAP&#148;). Internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the Company; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company&#146;s
assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of January&nbsp;31, 2011, the end
of the fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal
Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Management&#146;s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and
operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting
policies, and our overall control environment.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Based on our assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP. We reviewed the results of management&#146;s assessment
with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, on a quarterly basis we will
evaluate any changes to our internal control over financial reporting to determine if material
change occurred.

15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company&#146;s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls
or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A
control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the control system&#146;s objectives will be met. The design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must
be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is
based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject
to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or
deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Argan, Inc. (a Delaware
corporation) and subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for each of the years
then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Argan, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January&nbsp;31, 2011
and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years then
ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Argan, Inc. (&#147;Argan&#148;) conducts continuing operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Gemma
Power Systems, LLC and affiliates (&#147;GPS&#148;), which provide the substantial portion of consolidated
net revenues, and Southern Maryland Cable, Inc. (&#147;SMC&#148;). Argan and these consolidated wholly owned
subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Company.&#148; Through GPS, the Company provides a full
range of engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, maintenance and consulting services
to the power generation and renewable energy markets for a wide range of customers including public
utilities and independent power project owners. Through SMC, the Company provides
telecommunications infrastructure services including project management, construction, installation
and maintenance to commercial, local government and federal government customers primarily in the
mid-Atlantic region. Each of the wholly-owned subsidiaries represents a separate reportable
segment. Argan also conducted discontinued operations during the years ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 and
2010 that are discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Basis of Presentation </I>&#151; The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Argan and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company&#146;s fiscal year ends on January&nbsp;31. The results of
companies acquired during a reporting period are included in the consolidated financial statements
from the effective date of the acquisition. All significant inter-company balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company accounted for its 50% ownership investment in
GRP using the equity method until its purchase in December&nbsp;2009. Since the acquisition date, the
balance sheet and results of operations of GRP have been consolidated. In Note 18, the Company has
provided certain financial information relating to the operating results and assets of its industry
segments based on the manner in which management disaggregates the Company&#146;s financial reporting
for purposes of making internal operating decisions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Use of Estimates </I>&#151; The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;US GAAP&#148;) requires
management to make use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and
liabilities, net revenues, expenses, and certain financial statement disclosures including those
contained in Note 12. Management believes that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which
it relies are reasonable based upon information available to it at the time that these estimates,
judgments and assumptions are made. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the Company&#146;s
accounting for revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, long-lived assets, assets with
indefinite lives including goodwill, contingent obligations and deferred taxes. Actual results
could differ from these estimates.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Codification of US GAAP </I>&#151; On June&nbsp;30, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the &#147;FASB&#148;)
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;168, <I>The FASB Accounting Standards
Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;168&#148;) in
order to establish the <I>FASB Accounting Standards Codification </I>(the &#147;Codification&#148; or &#147;ASC&#148;), which
officially launched July&nbsp;1, 2009, as the sole source of authoritative generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States for nongovernmental entities, except for guidance issued by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;). SFAS No.&nbsp;168, which was primarily codified into ASC
Topic 105, <I>Generally Accepted Accounting Standards</I>, replaced the four-tiered US GAAP hierarchy
described in SFAS No.&nbsp;162, <I>The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles</I>, with a
two-level hierarchy consisting only of authoritative and non-authoritative guidance. The
Codification superseded all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other
non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification became
non-authoritative. The Company adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;168 for its consolidated financial statements last
year. Accordingly, all relevant references to authoritative literature reflect the Codification.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Fair Values </I>&#151; The provisions of ASC 820, <I>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</I>, apply to all
assets and liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis. Fair value is
defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or most
advantageous market. The requirements prescribe a fair value hierarchy that has three levels of
inputs, both observable and unobservable, with use of the lowest possible level of input to
determine fair value. Level 1 inputs include quoted market prices in an active market or the price
of an identical asset or liability. Level 2 inputs are market data other than Level 1 inputs that
are observable either directly or indirectly including quoted market prices for similar assets or
liabilities, quoted market prices in an inactive market, and other observable information that can
be corroborated by market data. Level 3 inputs are unobservable and corroborated by little or no
market data.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The carrying value amounts of the Company&#146;s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and other current liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values due to
the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of business segments (as needed for
purposes of determining indications of impairment to the carrying value of goodwill) is determined
using an average of valuations based on market multiples and discounted cash flows, and
consideration of our market capitalization. In the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2010, the acquisition of
GRP resulted in the valuation of fixed assets, inventory and other assets on a non-recurring basis
as presented in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, using primarily Level 2 inputs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Derivative Financial Instruments </I>&#151; The Company used interest rate swap agreements to hedge the
fluctuations in variable interest rates related to long term debt. As the interest rate swap
agreements were designated as cash flow hedging instruments and were effective as hedges, changes
in their fair value amounts were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. Any
instrument that would not qualify for hedge accounting would be marked to market with changes
recorded in earnings.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Property and Equipment </I>&#151; Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is determined
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally
from five to twenty years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful life of the related asset or the lease term, whichever is shorter. The costs of
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and major improvements are capitalized. When

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets </I>&#151; The Company reviews for impairment, at
least annually, the carrying values of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets deemed to
have an indefinite life. The Company tests for impairment of goodwill and these other intangible
assets more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset value might be
impaired. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the
goodwill impairment test is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the
reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The estimate of fair value of the
reporting unit, generally a company&#146;s operating segment, is determined using various valuation
techniques, with the principal techniques being a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiple
valuation. A discounted cash flow analysis requires making various judgmental assumptions,
including assumptions about future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. After taking into
consideration industry and company trends, if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its
carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not deemed impaired and the second step of the
impairment test is not performed. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair
value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of
impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair
value of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying
amount of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an
impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill
is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.
Accordingly, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities
of that reporting unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had
been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase
price paid to acquire the reporting unit.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Long-Lived Assets </I>&#151; Long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment and
purchased intangible assets with definite lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that a carrying amount should be assessed. The Company compares
the carrying value of the long-lived asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result
from the use of the asset. In the event the Company determines that the carrying value of the asset
is not recoverable, a loss would be recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value
exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is generally determined by using quoted market
prices or valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows, appraisals,
or other pricing models as appropriate. The useful lives and amortization of purchased intangible
assets are described in Note 9.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Revenue Recognition, Power Industry Services </I>&#151; Net revenues are recognized under various
construction agreements, including agreements for which net revenues are based on either a fixed
price or cost-plus-fee basis, with typical durations of one to three years. Net revenues from
cost-plus-fee construction agreements are recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the
period plus the fee earned, measured using the cost-to-cost method. Net revenues from fixed price
construction agreements, including a portion of estimated profit, are recognized as services are
provided, based on costs incurred and estimated total contract costs using the percentage of
completion method. Changes to total estimated contract costs or losses, if any, are recognized in
the period in which they are determined. Unapproved change orders, which approximated $287,000 at
January&nbsp;31, 2011, are reflected in net revenues

be recovered through a change in the contract price. In circumstances where recovery is considered probable but the net
revenues cannot be reliably estimated, costs attributable to change orders are deferred pending
determination of contract price. Construction agreements may contain incentive fees that provide
for increasing the Company&#146;s total fee on a particular contract based on the actual amount of costs
incurred in relation to an agreed upon target cost. The Company includes such fees in the
determination of total estimated net revenues when management believes that it is probable that
such fees have been earned, which is typically near the end of the contract performance period.

net revenues under various arrangements, including contracts for which net revenues are based on
either a fixed price or a time and materials basis. Net revenues from time and materials contracts
are recognized when the related services are provided to the customer. Net revenues from fixed
price contracts, including portions of estimated profit, are recognized as services are provided,
based on costs incurred and estimated amounts of total contract costs using the percentage of
completion method. Many of the contracts include multiple deliverables. Because these projects are
fully integrated undertakings, the Company cannot separate the services provided into individual
components. Losses on contracts, if any, are recognized in the periods in which they become known.

Company&#146;s nutritional products business segment, completed the sale of substantially all of its
assets (the &#147;Asset Sale&#148;) to an unaffiliated company. The Asset Sale was consummated for an
aggregate cash purchase price of up to $3,100,000 and the assumption by the purchaser of certain
trade payables and accrued expenses of VLI. The purchaser also assumed the remaining minimum lease
obligations related to VLI&#146;s office, warehouse and manufacturing facilities which totaled
approximately $446,000 as of January&nbsp;31, 2011. Of the cash purchase price, $800,000 was paid at
closing and the remaining $2,300,000 was placed into escrow. VLI will be paid from the escrow
amount (i)&nbsp;the cost of all pre-closing inventory sold, used or consumed within nine months of the
closing, and (ii)&nbsp;the amounts of all pre-closing accounts receivable of VLI that are collected by
September&nbsp;30, 2011. After September&nbsp;30, 2011, all uncollected accounts receivable will be returned
to VLI at no cost. At the end of nine months of the closing, all money still held in the escrow
account will be returned to the purchaser. Including additional loss from operations, the Company
expects the disposition to result in income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations in the approximate
range of $700,000 loss to $300,000 income for the fiscal year ending January&nbsp;31, 2012.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company holds cash on deposit in excess of federally insured limits and liquid mutual fund
investments at Bank of America (the &#147;Bank&#148;). Management does not believe that the risks associated
with keeping deposits in excess of federal deposit limits or holding investments in liquid mutual
funds represent material risks. The Company considers all liquid investments with original

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Pursuant to the requirements of an amended and restated engineering, procurement and construction
contract executed during the current year, GPS established a separate bank account which is used to
pay the costs defined as &#147;reimbursable costs&#148; that are incurred on the related project and to
receive cost reimbursement payments from the project owner. The amount of cash restricted for such
purposes was approximately $1.2&nbsp;million at January&nbsp;31, 2011.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">For certain construction projects, cash may be held in escrow as a substitute for retainage.
However, no amount of cash related to construction projects was held in escrow as of January&nbsp;31,
2011 or 2010. Pursuant to the agreement covering the acquisition of GPS, the Company deposited
$10.0&nbsp;million into an escrow account with the Bank in December&nbsp;2006 which secured a letter of
credit that was issued in support of a bonding commitment. In August&nbsp;2009, the letter of credit was
amended with the amount required by the surety reduced to $5.0&nbsp;million. In June&nbsp;2010, the letter of
credit was terminated as the surety eliminated the requirement. Accordingly, $5.0&nbsp;million was
released from the escrow account during each of the corresponding fiscal years.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Both accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represent amounts
due from customers for services rendered or products delivered. The timing of billings to customers
under construction-type contracts varies based on individual contracts and often differs from the
periods in which net revenues are recognized. The amount of costs and estimated earnings in excess
of billings at January&nbsp;31, 2011 was approximately $1.4&nbsp;million; this amount is expected to be
billed and collected in the normal course of business. The comparable amount of costs and estimated
earnings in excess of billings at January&nbsp;31, 2010 was $12.9&nbsp;million, all of which was billed and
collected during the current year. Retainage amounts included in accounts receivable represent
amounts withheld by construction customers until a defined phase of a contract or project has been
completed and accepted by the customer. The retainage amounts included in accounts receivable at
January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010 were $3,852,000 and $260,000, respectively. The length of retainage
periods may vary, but they are typically between six months and two years.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company conducts business and may extend credit to customers based on an evaluation of the
customers&#146; financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. Exposure to losses on
accounts receivable is expected to differ by customer due to the varying financial condition of
each customer. The Company monitors its exposure to credit losses and maintains allowances for
anticipated losses considered necessary under the circumstances based on historical experience with
uncollected accounts and a review of its currently outstanding accounts receivable. The amounts of
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010 were $5.5&nbsp;million and $5.6
million, respectively. Last year, a substantial portion of the accounts receivable from the owner
of a partially completed construction project was written down against the allowance, without any
effect on the statement of operations for the prior year. The remaining amount of the account
balance, $5.5&nbsp;million, is fully reserved and represents the amount of the net proceeds remaining
from a public auction of the facility. The amount of the Company&#146;s share of the auction proceeds,
if any, is not known at this time. In addition, last year SMC established an allowance in the
amount of $45,000 related to a disputed item; in the current year, the amount was reversed in
connection with the resolution of the matter.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In June&nbsp;2008, GPS entered into a business partnership with a firm that develops and operates
wind-energy farms for the purpose of designing and constructing such power-generation facilities.
The business partners each owned 50% of the company, GRP.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On December&nbsp;17, 2009, the Company acquired the other 50% ownership interest in GRP. The acquisition
was completed pursuant to the terms and conditions of a purchase and sale agreement (the &#147;Purchase
Agreement&#148;), and GRP became a wholly-owned subsidiary of GPS. The purchase price was $3,183,000, a
portion of which in the amount of $1,583,000 was paid in January&nbsp;2010 upon the award to GRP by the
developer of an initial construction project. The remaining portion of the purchase price was
included in accrued liabilities at January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">This amount is to become due upon the satisfaction of certain conditions related to the award to
GRP of a second wind farm construction project as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. During the
fourth quarter of the current year, GRP signed a contract for the design and construction of a 200
megawatt wind energy project in Henry County, Illinois, including the installation of up to one
hundred thirty-four (134)&nbsp;wind turbines with a planned completion date in the first quarter of
2012. As a result and pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company expects that
this award will lead to the payment of the remaining portion of the purchase price.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Membership Acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase for the net assets of GRP primarily due
to the adjustment of certain acquired assets and liabilities to fair values. The following table
summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The Company&#146;s allocation was based on an
evaluation by management of the appropriate fair values. The transaction costs were not
significant. The allocation was completed as follows:

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Prior to the Membership Acquisition and under an agreement with GRP, GPS incurred certain costs on
behalf of GRP. In addition, GPS provided administrative and accounting services for GRP. The total
amount of such reimbursable costs incurred by GPS in the fiscal year ended January&nbsp;31, 2010 was
approximately $1,059,000.

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In connection with the acquisitions of GPS and SMC, the Company recorded substantial amounts of
goodwill and other purchased intangible assets including contractual and other customer
relationships, non-compete agreements and trade names. The amount of goodwill included in the
balance sheets at January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010 relates entirely to the acquisition of GPS. For income
tax reporting purposes, goodwill allocated to GPS in the approximate amount of $12.3&nbsp;million is
being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 15&nbsp;years. The remaining amount of the
Company&#146;s goodwill is not amortizable for income tax reporting purposes.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company&#146;s other purchased intangible assets consisted of the following assets at January&nbsp;31,
2011 and 2010:
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Trade Names </I>&#151; The Company determined the fair values of the GPS and SMC Trade Names using a
relief-from-royalty methodology. The Company also considered recognition by potential customers of
a trade name such as GPS. The Company believes that the useful life of the GPS Trade Name is
fifteen years, the period over which the Trade Name is expected to contribute to future cash flows.
Management concluded that the useful life of the SMC Trade Name was indefinite since it is
expected to contribute directly to future cash flows in perpetuity. While SMC is not a nationally
recognized trade name, it is a recognized name in the mid-Atlantic region, SMC&#146;s primary area of
operations. The Company uses the relief-from-royalty method described above to test the SMC Trade
Name for impairment annually on November 1 and on an interim basis if events or changes in
circumstances between annual tests indicate that the SMC Trade Name might be impaired. An
impairment loss of $43,000 was recorded by SMC related to its trade name and was included in
selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Non-Compete Agreements </I>&#151; The fair value amounts of three non-compete agreements with the former
owners of acquired businesses were determined at the time of the acquisitions by discounting the
estimated reductions in the cash flows that would be expected if the key employees were to leave
the Company. These key employees signed non-compete agreements prohibiting them from competing
directly or indirectly for five years. The estimated reduced cash flows were discounted based on a
rate that reflected the perceived risk of the applicable non-compete agreement, the estimated
weighted average cost of capital and the asset mix of the acquired company. The Company is
amortizing fair value amounts ascribed to the non-compete agreements over five years, the
contractual length of each non-compete agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The changes in the carrying amounts of other purchased intangible assets for the years ended
January&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2011 were as follows.

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company has financing arrangements with Bank of America (the &#147;Bank&#148;). The financing
arrangements, as amended, provide a revolving loan with a maximum borrowing amount of $4.25&nbsp;million
that is available until May&nbsp;31, 2011, with interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%. We may obtain standby
letters of credit from the Bank in the ordinary course of business not to exceed $10.0&nbsp;million for
surety bonding. The amended financing arrangements also covered term loans in the amounts of $8.0
million and $1.5&nbsp;million, with interest at LIBOR plus 3.25%, that were repaid during the years
ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We used the funds borrowed from the Bank for the
acquisition of GPS and for the retirement of certain debt assumed in connection with the
acquisition of VLI, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company had interest rate swap agreements with a total initial notional amount of $5,125,000
that expired last fiscal year. Under the swap agreements, the Company agreed to exchange each month
the difference between fixed and floating LIBOR interest rate amounts calculated by reference to
the current notional principal balance. Until the expiration date, the Company carried an accrued
liability amount in order to recognize the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Interest expense amounts related to the term loans and the corresponding interest rate swap
agreements discussed above were $35,000 and $184,000 for the years ended January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Bank requires that the Company comply with certain financial covenants at its fiscal year-end
and at each of its fiscal quarter-ends (using a rolling 12-month period) including covenants that
(1)&nbsp;the ratio of total funded debt to EBITDA not exceed 2 to 1, (2)&nbsp;the fixed charge coverage ratio
be not less than 1.25 to 1, and (3)&nbsp;the ratio of senior funded debt to EBITDA not exceed 1.50 to 1.
The Bank&#146;s consent is required for acquisitions and divestitures. We have pledged the majority of
the Company&#146;s assets to secure the financing arrangements. The amended financing arrangements
contain an acceleration clause which allows the Bank to declare outstanding borrowed amounts due
and payable if it determines in good faith that a material adverse change has occurred in the
financial condition of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. We believe that the Company will
continue to comply with its financial covenants under the financing arrangements. If the Company&#146;s
performance does not result in compliance with any of its financial covenants, or if the Bank seeks
to exercise its rights under the acceleration clause referred to above, we would seek to modify the
financing arrangements. However, there can be no assurance that the Bank would not exercise its
rights and remedies under the financing arrangements including accelerating the payment of any
outstanding senior debt. At January&nbsp;31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with the financial
covenants of its amended financing arrangements.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">GPS was the contractor for engineering, procurement and construction services related to an
anhydrous ethanol plant in Carleton, Nebraska (the &#147;Project&#148;). The Project owner was ALTRA
Nebraska, LLC (&#147;Altra&#148;). In November&nbsp;2007, GPS and Altra agreed to a suspension of the Project
while Altra sought to obtain financing to complete the Project. By March&nbsp;2008, financing had not
been arranged which terminated the construction contract prior to completion of the Project. In
March&nbsp;2008, GPS filed a mechanic&#146;s lien against the Project in the approximate amount of $23.8
million, which amount included all sums owed to the subcontractors/suppliers of GPS and their
subcontractors/suppliers. In August&nbsp;2009, Altra filed for bankruptcy protection. Proceedings
resulted in a court-ordered liquidation of Altra&#146;s assets. The incomplete plant was sold at auction
in October&nbsp;2009. Remaining net proceeds of approximately $5.5&nbsp;million are being held by the
bankruptcy court and have not been distributed to Altra&#146;s creditors.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Delta-T Corporation (&#147;Delta-T&#148;) was a major subcontractor to GPS on the Project. In January&nbsp;2009,
GPS and Delta-T executed a Project Close-Out Agreement (the &#147;Close-Out&#148;) which settled all contract
claims between the parties and included a settlement payment in the amount of $3.5&nbsp;million that GPS
made to Delta-T. In the Close-Out, Delta-T also agreed to prosecute any lien claims against Altra,
to assign to GPS the first $3.5&nbsp;million of any resulting proceeds and to indemnify and defend any
claims against GPS related to the Project. In addition, GPS received a guarantee from Delta-T&#146;s
parent company in support of the indemnification commitment.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In April&nbsp;2009, one of the subcontractors to Delta-T received an arbitration award in its favor
against Delta-T in the amount of approximately $6.8&nbsp;million, including approximately $662,000 in
interest and $2.3&nbsp;million identified in the award as amounts applied to other projects (the
&#147;Judgment Award&#148;). In April&nbsp;2009, the subcontractor also filed suit in the District Court of Thayer
County, Nebraska, in order to recover its claimed amount of $3.6&nbsp;million unpaid by Delta-T on the
Altra project from a payment bond issued to Altra on behalf of GPS. In December&nbsp;2009, the Judgment
Award was confirmed in federal district court in Florida. In February&nbsp;2010, the subcontractor
amended the amount of its complaint filed in the Nebraska court against the payment bond to $6.8
million, plus interest, to match the amount of the Judgment Award. Delta-T has not paid or
satisfied any portion of the award. Management understands that Delta-T has abandoned its defense
of the surety company.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company intends to vigorously pursue its lien claim against the Altra project as well as to
defend this matter for the surety company, to investigate the inclusion of the $2.3&nbsp;million applied
to other projects in the Judgment Award, to demand that Delta-T satisfy its obligations under the
Close Out, and/or to enforce the guarantee provided to GPS by Delta-T&#146;s parent company. Due to the
early stages of these legal proceedings, assurance cannot be provided by the Company that it will
be successful in these efforts. It is reasonably possible that resolution of the matters discussed
above could result in a loss with a material negative effect on the Company&#146;s consolidated
operating results in a future reporting period. However, at this time, management cannot make an
estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, related to these matters. No provision for loss
has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of January&nbsp;31, 2011 related to these
matters. If new facts become known in the future indicating that it is probable that a loss has
been incurred by GPS and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated by GPS, the impact of the
change will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements at that time.

are ongoing.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company is vigorously defending this litigation. Although the Company believes it has
meritorious defenses, it is impracticable to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of a
trial or to estimate a likely range of potential damages, if any, at this stage of the litigation.
The ultimate resolution of the litigation with Tampa Bay could result in a material adverse effect
on the results of operations of the Company for a future reporting period.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In response to VLI&#146;s lawsuit filed against Beveragette Ventures LLC (&#147;Beveragette&#148;), representing a
claim for unpaid invoices, Beveragette, a former customer, filed a counterclaim in the United
States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Fort Myers Division, against VLI on or
about September&nbsp;23, 2010. The causes of action related to orders for product issued by Beveragette
to VLI in 2009 and were based on a series of allegations including breach of contract by VLI.
Beveragette claimed that it suffered damages in excess of $4&nbsp;million as a result of lost sales due
to the supply by VLI of non-conforming product and also sought punitive damages. In December&nbsp;2010,
the parties settled this matter, with VLI making a settlement payment in the amount of $65,000, and
provided each other with a full and final release of all claims. As a result, each lawsuit has been
dismissed with prejudice.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company has a stock option plan that was established in August&nbsp;2001 (the &#147;Option Plan&#148;). Under
the Option Plan, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors may grant stock options to officers, directors
and key employees. Stock options that are granted may be Incentive Stock Options (&#147;ISOs&#148;) or
nonqualified stock options&#148; (NSOs&#148;). ISOs granted under the Option Plan shall have an exercise
price per share at least equal to the common stock&#146;s fair market value per share at the date of
grant, a ten-year term, and typically become fully exercisable one year from the date of grant.
NSOs may be granted at an exercise price per share that differs from the common stock&#146;s fair market
value per share at the date of grant, may have up to a ten-year term, and become exercisable as
determined by the Board.

Black-Scholes option pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Current guidance
provided by the SEC permits the use of a &#147;simplified method&#148; in developing the estimates of the
expected terms of &#147;plain-vanilla&#146;&#146; share options under certain circumstances, including situations
where a company having historical stock option exercise experience that is insufficient to provide
a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected terms. The Company utilizes the simplified
method to estimate the expected terms of its stock option awards.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The favorable net tax effect of permanent items for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2010 reflects
primarily the estimated domestic manufacturing deduction. The favorable income tax effect of this
deduction for the current year was offset by compensation expense amounts not deductible for income
tax reporting purposes. During the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2011, the Company also recorded
unfavorable return-to-provision true-up adjustments that related to income tax returns for various
prior year periods.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheets as of January&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010 included net deferred tax
assets related to continuing operations in the amounts of $1.1&nbsp;million and $1.6&nbsp;million,
respectively, resulting from future deductible temporary differences. The Company&#146;s ability to
realize its deferred tax assets depends primarily upon the generation of sufficient future taxable
income to allow for the utilization of the Company&#146;s deductible temporary differences and tax
planning strategies. If such estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be
required to record additional valuation allowances against some or all of the deferred tax assets
resulting in additional income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations. At this
time, based substantially on the strong earnings performance of the Company&#146;s power industry
services business segment, management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company
will realize benefit for its deferred tax assets.
