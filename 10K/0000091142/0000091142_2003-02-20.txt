PART 1

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
-----------------

We are a leading manufacturer of electric motors and water heating equipment,
serving a diverse mix of residential, commercial, and industrial end markets
principally in the United States with a growing international presence. Our
company is organized in two segments: Electrical Products and Water Systems. Our
Electrical Products business manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of
hermetic motors, fractional horsepower alternating current (AC) and direct
current (DC) motors, and integral horsepower motors. Our Water Systems business
manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of residential gas and electric
water heaters, standard and specialty commercial water heating equipment,
high-efficiency copper-tube boilers, and water systems tanks. In 2002, we had
net sales of approximately $1.5 billion, with 54 percent attributable to our
Electrical Products business and 46 percent attributable to our Water Systems
business.

During the past six years, we have significantly repositioned our company. We
have changed from a diversified manufacturer with five businesses, the largest
of which was our legacy automotive structural components business that
represented more than 50 percent of our total sales, to a company focused on our
Electrical Products and Water Systems businesses, which we believe offer the
opportunity for higher growth and more profitability.

The following table summarizes our net sales by operating segment. This segment
summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in
conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements which appear elsewhere in this document.

ElectricAL PRODUCTS

Our Electrical Products segment sales decreased $12 million or two percent in
2002 to $790 million. Excluding the third quarter 2002 acquisition of the
hermetic motor assets of the Athens Products (Athens) division of the Electrolux
Group, segment sales declined approximately $32 million or four percent. The
decrease in sales in 2002 was primarily due to lower sales of motors to the
heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) market.

We are one of the three largest manufacturers of electric motors in North
America, having manufactured approximately 36 million electric motors in 2002.
We offer a comprehensive line of hermetic motors, fractional horsepower AC and
DC motors, and integral horsepower motors, ranging in size from sub-fractional
C-frame ventilation motors up to 500 horsepower hermetic and 800 horsepower
specialty integral motors. We believe our extensive product offering gives us an
advantage in our targeted markets, often allowing us to serve all of our
customers electric motor needs. We have significantly broadened our electric
motor product line and customer base through a series of acquisitions over the
last six years, including

                                       2
<PAGE>

UPPCO, General Electric Company's domestic hermetic motor business, MagneTek's
electric motor business, and the hermetic motor assets of Athens.

Our motors are used in a wide range of targeted residential, commercial, and
industrial applications, including: hermetic motors that are sold worldwide to
manufacturers of air conditioning and commercial refrigeration compressors;
fractional horsepower fan motors used in furnaces, air conditioners, and
blowers; fractional horsepower motors for pumps for home water systems, swimming
pools, hot tubs, and spas; fractional horsepower motors used in other consumer
products (such as garage door openers); and integral horsepower AC and DC motors
for industrial and commercial applications. Sales to the heating, ventilating,
air conditioning and refrigeration market account for more than 60 percent of
segment sales. In July 2002, we expanded our presence in the hermetic motor
market by acquiring Athens.

Approximately 85 percent of our 2002 segment sales were to original equipment
manufacturers (OEM) in a diverse mix of industries, with the remainder of sales
directed to the aftermarket or distribution channels. Sales to our largest
customer, York International and its wholly owned Bristol Compressors
subsidiary, were $173 million in 2002 and represented approximately 22 percent
of segment sales. We believe that more than 25 percent of our total segment
sales were attributable to products used outside of the United States. We
estimate that approximately 60 percent of the market is derived from the less
cyclical replacement business with the remainder being impacted by general
business conditions in the new construction market.

To remain a leader in this highly competitive industry, we are committed to
being a low-cost supplier of electrical products. We were one of the first motor
manufacturers to identify the cost-reduction potential of Mexican operations,
and today we manufacture a majority of our electric motors in our 16 Mexican
motor facilities. In late 2001, we undertook an initiative to accelerate the
cost-reduction programs that were already underway in our motor operations to
enhance our competitive position. These initiatives included transferring six
additional product manufacturing lines to our lower-cost Mexican operations;
reducing salaried workforce by 10 percent; and realigning our warehouse
facilities into three hub operations to improve customer service while reducing
cost. In December 2001, we acquired Shenzhen Speeda, a manufacturer of
sub-fractional horsepower electric motors in China. In December 2002, we
acquired the motor manufacturing assets of Jiangsu Changheng Group Co. Ltd.
(Changheng), of Changzhou, China. While Changheng has an existing customer base
in China, the primary purpose of the Chinese acquisitions is to further expand
our ability to manufacture products for the U.S. market.

Our principal competitors in the electric motor industry are Emerson Electric
Co. and General Electric Company. A number of other companies, such as Fasco
Motors, Baldor Electric, Regal-Beloit Corporation, and Jakel Incorporated,
compete with us in specific segments of the electric motor market.

WATER SYSTEMS

Our Water Systems business had sales in 2002 of $679 million, $330 million
higher than 2001 sales of $349 million. The higher sales were the result of $313
million in sales from the acquisition of State Industries Inc. (State).
Excluding State, sales increased approximately 5 percent. The majority of the
company's sales are in the less cyclical replacement market, although the new
housing market is also an important market for the business.

We serve residential, commercial, and industrial end markets with a broad range
of products, including:

Residential gas and electric water heaters. Our residential water heaters come
in sizes ranging from two-gallon (point-of-use) models to 120-gallon appliances
with varying efficiency ranges. We offer traditional atmospheric water heaters
as well as direct-vented and power-vented models for today's energy efficient
homes. Domestic residential water heater sales in 2002 were $430 million or
approximately 63 percent of segment revenues.

                                       3
<PAGE>

Standard commercial water heaters. Our gas, oil, and electric water heaters come
in capacities ranging from 50 to 100 gallons and are used by customers who
require a consistent, economical source of hot water. Typical applications
include restaurants, hotels and motels, laundries, car washes, and small
businesses.

Our Water Systems business also manufactures and markets specialty commercial
water heaters, copper-tube boilers, expansion tanks, and related products and
parts.

We are one of the two largest manufacturers and marketers of water heaters in
North America, manufacturing more than three million units in 2002. We have a
leading share in the commercial water heating segment, and we believe we are the
only domestic manufacturer that offers standard and specialty commercial water
heater products. We believe that our comprehensive commercial product line gives
us a competitive advantage in this higher-margin segment of the water heating
industry. We also are one of the leaders in the residential water heating
segment with an extensive line of high-efficiency gas and electric models. We
significantly broadened our market scope and product offering with the
acquisition of State. This acquisition allowed us to enter the retail segment of
the residential market, a channel that represents approximately one-half of the
total United States residential market. The acquisition of State also enhanced
our position in the wholesale distribution channel and gave us a position in
several new distribution channels, such as direct sales to large homebuilders
and the manufactured housing market.

An increasing number of government regulations will have a significant impact on
the United States water heating industry in the coming years, and we believe we
will benefit from our engineering expertise in this challenging environment.
Beginning in July of this year, United States water heater manufacturers will be
required to comply with new flammable vapor ignition resistance standards for
virtually all residential gas water heaters. These new standards and testing
protocols established by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
require that gas water heaters deal with the accidental ignition of flammable
vapors, such as emitted by spilled gasoline or other liquids. Other regulations
impacting our markets include restrictions on water heater emissions of nitrogen
oxides (to date mandated only in California and Texas) and a United States
government requirement to increase the efficiency of residential gas and
electric water heaters by January 2004. We believe we will successfully comply
with these new regulations on a timely basis.

Our water systems wholesale distribution channel includes more than 2,600
wholesale plumbing distributors that serve residential, commercial, and
industrial markets. We also sell our residential water heaters through the
retail channel. In this channel, our customers include four of the six largest
national hardware and home center chains, including a long-standing private
label relationship with Sears, Roebuck and Co.

Our principal domestic water heating competitors include Rheem Manufacturing
Company, Inc. and, to a lesser extent, American Water Heater Company and
Bradford-White Corporation.

RAW MATERIAL

Raw materials for our manufacturing operations, which consist primarily of
steel, copper, and aluminum, are generally available from several sources in
adequate quantities. We hedge the majority of our annual copper purchases to
protect against price volatility.

SEASONALITY

There is no significant seasonal pattern to our consolidated quarterly sales and
earnings.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS, AND TRADEMARKS

In order to improve competitiveness by generating new products and processes, we
conduct research and development at our Corporate Technology Center in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin as well as at our operating units. Total expenditures for
research and development in 2002, 2001, and 2000, were approximately $30.4,
$27.6, and $24.5 million, respectively.

We own and use in our businesses various trademarks, trade names, patents, trade
secrets, and licenses. While a number of these are important to us, we do not
consider a material part of our business to be dependent on any one of them.

EMPLOYEES

Our company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 16,200 employees as of
December 31, 2002.

BACKLOG

Normally, none of our operations sustain significant backlogs.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

Our operations are governed by a variety of federal, state, and local laws
intended to protect the environment. While environmental considerations are a
part of all significant capital expenditures, compliance with the environmental
laws has not had a material effect and is not expected to have a material effect
upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of our company.
See Item 3.

FOREIGN SALES

Total U.S. export sales from our operations were $90, $91, and $62 million in
2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
--------------------------

We are involved in various unresolved legal actions, administrative proceedings,
and claims in the ordinary course of our business involving product liability,
property damage, insurance coverage, patents, and environmental matters
including the disposal of hazardous waste. Although it is not possible to
predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the
range of possible loss or recovery, we believe these unresolved legal actions
will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of
operations. A more detailed discussion of these matters appears in Note 14 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OF OPERATIONS
-------------

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We recorded net earnings of $51.3 million or $1.86 per share in 2002,
significantly higher than the $14.5 million or $.61 per share earned in 2001.
The significant improvement in earnings was primarily a result of cost reduction
actions in our Electrical Products business and integration activities related
to the acquisition of State. The Water Systems business established new sales
and earnings records in 2002. Individual segment performance will be discussed
later in this section.

Our working capital for continuing operations at December 31, 2002, was $228.1
million compared with $219.8 million and $204.3 million at December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively. The increase in our working capital in 2002 was due to
higher cash balances and the increase in 2001 was due to the acquisition of
State in December 2001. Cash flow from operating activities during 2002 was
$112.2 million compared with $49.8 million in 2001. Significantly higher
earnings levels and a $12.4 million tax refund received in March 2002 explain
the majority of the improvement.

Our capital expenditures were $42.5 million in 2002 compared with $35.3 million
in 2001 and $40.5 million in 2000. The increase in 2002 was associated with our
acquisition of State. The decrease in capital spending in 2001 occurred in our
Electrical Products business. We are projecting 2003 capital expenditures to be
approximately $45 million and marginally lower than projected 2003 depreciation
expense. Our cash flow during 2003 is expected to adequately cover our projected
capital expenditures. We believe that our present facilities and planned capital
expenditures are sufficient to provide adequate capacity for our operations in
2003.

On May 10, 2002, we completed the sale of 4.8 million shares of our common stock
through a public offering at a price of $28.25 per share. With the $127.5
million net proceeds from our stock offering and operating cash flow, we reduced
our debt by $156.2 million from $406.9 million at December 31, 2001, to $250.7
million at December 31, 2002. Our leverage, as measured by the ratio of total
debt to total capitalization, was 33 percent, down significantly from 47 percent
at the end of 2001. Excluding potential acquisitions, we expect 2003 cash flow
to result in a year-end leverage ratio less than 30 percent.

We expect to have adequate liquidity in 2003 as we have a minimal amount of
long-term debt maturing. In addition, we have a $250.0 million multi-year
revolving credit facility with a group of nine financial institutions that
expires on August 2, 2004, and an $82.5 million 364-day credit facility with a
group of six banks that expires on July 25, 2003. We expect these credit
facilities are adequate to support any short-term borrowing needs. At December
31, 2002, we had available borrowing capacity of $222.1 million under our credit
facilities. For information about our contractual obligations for indebtedness,
capital leases, operating leases and related obligations as of December 31,
2002, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that
the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will
provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable
future.

Recent declines in the U.S. equity market have resulted in a reduction in the
fair value of the assets of our pension plans. This asset value reduction,
coupled with an increase in the present value of the obligations of our pension
plans due to declining interest rates, has resulted in accumulated pension
benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of the plan assets by $89 million.
Accordingly, we took a non-cash charge to equity of $115 million, representing
the recording of this liability, the elimination of the prepaid asset, and
related deferred tax effects. This charge has no impact on current cash flow or
net earnings. Our pension plans continue to meet all funding requirements under
ERISA regulations, and under current assumptions, we do not expect any
significant minimum funding requirements for several years. See Note 12 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

                                       11
<PAGE>

In connection with our acquisition of Athens in July 2002, we recorded purchase
liabilities of $4.2 million primarily for employee severance costs associated
with product manufacturing repositioning. As of December 31, 2002, we have
charged $1.1 million against this reserve. In connection with the Athens
acquisition and certain other acquisitions, we recorded aggregate purchase
liabilities of $26.5 million at the respective acquisition dates for employee
severance and relocation, as well as certain facility exit costs. As of December
31, 2002, we incurred and charged $17.1 million against these liabilities. We
expect the majority of the activities to be completed by December 31, 2003.

Included in other assets is a $34.0 million receivable due to the payments of
claims associated with the dip tube class action lawsuit. See Note 14 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect a modest increase to the
receivable in 2003. The receivable is classified as a long-term asset because
court proceedings will not begin until late 2003 and may not be concluded until
2004 or later.

We have paid dividends for 63 consecutive years. We paid total dividends of $.54
per share in 2002 compared with $.52 per share in 2001.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our sales in 2002 were $1.47 billion, an increase of $317.9 million or 27.6
percent from sales of $1.15 billion in 2001. The sales increase was due to our
acquisitions of State in December 2001 and Athens in July 2002 as well as higher
sales in our base water heater business partially offset by a modest decline in
our electric motor business. Sales in 2001 decreased by $96.8 million or 7.8
percent from sales of $1.25 billion in 2000. The lower sales resulted from an
11.0 percent decline in our Electrical Products segment, which more than offset
a slight increase in sales for our Water Systems business.

Our gross profit margin for 2002 was 20.4 percent, compared with 17.6 percent
and 19.9 percent in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The significant improvement in
margin from 2001 to 2002 resulted from lower manufacturing costs associated with
the product repositioning program at Electrical Products and the integration of
the State acquisition. The decline in gross margin from 2000 to 2001 occurred
within our Electrical Products segment and was due primarily to under-absorption
of manufacturing costs associated with lower volume, Mexican wage inflation
throughout the year, and increased costs for certain raw materials.

Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) in 2002 was $206.2 million
and increased by $60.5 million from the $145.7 million recorded in 2001
primarily as a result of incremental SG&A associated with the State acquisition.
SG&A in 2001 was $8.0 million lower than 2000. The decrease resulted from
volume-related reductions in selling expense and cost reduction programs.

We have significant pension benefit costs and credits that are developed from
actuarial valuations. The valuations reflect key assumptions regarding, among
other things, discount rates, expected return on plan assets, retirement ages,
and years of service. Consideration is given to current market conditions,
including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. Our assumption
for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets was 9.75 percent in 2002
compared with 10.0 percent in 2001. Our 2003 assumption for return on assets
reflects a further reduction to 9.0 percent which should result in pension
income recognition of approximately $10.0 million in 2003. We recognized pension
income of $17.1 million, $20.2 million, and $17.7 million in 2002, 2001, and
2000 respectively, reflected as reductions to cost of products sold and SG&A.
See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In developing our expected long-term rate of return assumption, we evaluated our
pension plan's target asset allocation, historical long-term rates of return of
equity and bond indices, and actual historical returns of our pension plan. Our
plan's target allocation to equity managers is 65 percent and the target
allocation to bond managers is 35 percent. Due to market fluctuations, our
actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2002, was 60 percent to equity
managers and 40 percent to bond managers. We regularly review our actual asset
allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation
when considered appropriate. We also considered our pension plan's historical
10-year and 25-year compounded annualized returns of 10.8 percent and 12.7
percent, respectively. We believe that with our target allocation and the
historical long-term returns of equity and bond indices, as well as our actual
historical returns, our 9.0 percent expected return on assets for 2003 is
reasonable.

The discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension obligations is
based on the average yield of Moody's Aa Corporate Bonds. The discount rate
determined on this basis has decreased from 7.25 percent at December 31, 2001,
to 6.75 percent at December 31, 2002. We will continue to evaluate our actuarial
assumptions at least annually, and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary.

Interest expense was $13.9 million in 2002, compared with $16.4 million and
$22.1 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Decreasing interest rates
throughout the past three years coupled with a significant reduction in debt
resulting from our stock offering in May 2002 were responsible for the downward
trend in interest expense. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Amortization of intangibles decreased to $0.3 million in 2002 from approximately
$7.0 million in both 2001 and 2000. We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible

                                       13
<PAGE>

Assets" as of January 1, 2002. Under the new standard, goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but instead are
reviewed annually for impairment, and accordingly goodwill amortization of $6.7
million in 2001 and 2000 was not recorded in 2002. See Note 8 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other expense decreased slightly to $1.0 million from $1.4 million in 2001. The
$1.1 million increase from 2000 to 2001 was due mostly to losses incurred on
forward foreign currency contracts.

Our effective tax rate was 34.5 percent in 2002, 35.5 percent in 2001, and 36.0
percent in 2000. The effective rate in 2002 benefited from the implementation of
a more efficient tax structure for international operations. The decline in the
rate from 2000 to 2001 resulted from increased research and state tax credits,
partially offset by the negative impact of the losses in low-tax foreign
jurisdictions.

We recorded net earnings of $51.3 million or $1.86 per share in 2002 compared
with $14.5 million or $.61 per share in 2001. Net earnings in 2001 included a
$6.0 million after-tax special charge ($.25 on a per share basis) related
primarily to the restructuring of our electric motor operation.

Electrical Products
On July 1, 2002, we purchased the hermetic motor assets of Athens for
approximately $9.7 million. Athens, based in Athens, Tennessee, is a
manufacturer of hermetic motors for both scroll and reciprocating compressors.
This purchase is expected to generate incremental sales in 2003 of approximately
$20 million and modest earnings in the second half of the year. In the fourth
quarter of 2002, we also acquired the motor manufacturing assets of Jiangsu
Changheng Group Co. Ltd. (Changheng) for approximately $15.3 million. Changheng
is located in the JiangSu province of China and manufactures air-moving motors
for the Chinese air conditioning market. Although Changheng has an existing
customer base in China, the primary purpose of the acquisition is to further
expand our ability to manufacture products for the U.S. market. See Note 2 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Sales in our Electrical Products segment in 2002 were $790.4 million, $12.3
million lower than 2001 sales of $802.7 million. Excluding approximately $20
million in sales attributable to the Athens acquisition, sales declined by $32.0
million from 2001 to 2002. Sales to the heating, ventilating, and air
conditioning (HVAC) market, excluding Athens, declined by six percent in 2002
and accounted for the majority of the total decrease in sales. Sales in 2000
were $902.4 million. The HVAC market experienced a decline of approximately $60
million or 11 percent from 2000 to 2001. The lower demand in 2001 was due to a
number of factors including general economic conditions, reduced discretionary
spending on the part of consumers, and inventory adjustments by air conditioning
manufacturers and retailers.

Operating earnings for our Electrical Products segment in 2002 were $57.6
million or $22.1 million higher than 2001 earnings adjusted to exclude goodwill
amortization expense of $6.7 million and special pretax charges of $8.1 million
in 2001. The increased earnings were primarily due to the cost reduction program
announced in the fourth quarter of 2001. The program consisted of three major
elements: consolidation of warehouse facilities; reduction of approximately 150
salaried employees; and relocation of production from six domestic facilities to
Mexico and China. The combination of these actions was expected to generate
savings of $16 million in 2002 and $20 to $25 million annually thereafter.
During 2002, we exceeded our goal and generated $19 million in first-year
savings and project 2003 cost savings to exceed $25 million. Operating earnings
in 2000 were $75.5 million and compare with earnings of $28.9 million excluding
the special pretax charge of $8.1 million in 2001. The significant decline in
2001 earnings was due mostly to lower sales volume, higher costs for raw
materials and Mexican labor, and more competitive market conditions.

Water Systems
Sales for our Water Systems segment were $678.7 million in 2002, or $330.2
million higher than sales of $348.5 million in 2001. The State acquisition
contributed $312.6 million of the increase. The remaining increase was
attributable to higher volume for the base residential and commercial business
and the China operation. The slight

                                       14

increase in 2001 sales from $345.5 million in 2000 was due to higher sales of
residential products and growth in the China operation, partially offset by
lower sales in other international markets.

Operating earnings for our Water Systems segment were $58.4 million or $17.9
million higher than 2001 earnings of $40.5 million before special charges. The
higher earnings in 2002 were the result of the State acquisition and its related
synergies, and increased sales volume in the base business. The earnings
improvement from $34.9 million in 2000 to $40.5 million before special charges
in 2001 was the result of higher volume, better performance in China, and
improved plant efficiencies throughout the organization.

During 2002, we moved the Water Systems segment headquarters from Irving, Texas
to Ashland City, Tennessee, State's headquarters, to facilitate the integration
of the two businesses. A special pretax charge of $1.3 million was recognized in
the fourth quarter of 2001 for lease and certain other costs associated with
this move.

Critical Accounting Policies
Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. Also as disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute
certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of
judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such
differences may be material to the financial statements.

The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our
financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the
recoverability of certain assets including goodwill and receivables resulting
from the payment of claims associated with the dip tube class action lawsuit
(see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) as well as those
estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity,
litigation, product liability, environmental matters, and pensions and other
post-retirement benefits. Various assumptions and other factors underlie the
determination of these significant estimates. The process of determining
significant estimates is fact-specific and takes into account factors such as
historical experience and trends, and in some cases, actuarial techniques. We
constantly reevaluate these significant factors and adjustments are made when
facts and circumstances dictate. Historically, actual results have not
significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described
above.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations," SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," and SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation - Transition Disclosures." SFAS No. 143 will become
effective for us on January 1, 2003. Adoption of this statement is not expected
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. SFAS No.
144, which was adopted on January 1, 2002, has not had a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements since its adoption. SFAS No. 146 will be
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.
Adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements. Effective December 31, 2002, we began making
the disclosures required under SFAS No. 148.

Outlook
Our overall cost structure improved significantly during 2002. Our operating
units will continue to aggressively manage cost in the new year, and we remain
confident in our full-year 2003 earnings estimate of between $2.05 and $2.25 per
share.

While we are confident in the full-year estimate, earnings improvement will
occur primarily in the last half of the year. Cost increases, including pension,
employee medical costs, and liability insurance will impact us throughout the
year. Operating improvements, however, will build up incrementally during the
year and are weighted to the last half of the year. These improvements include
the continued success of the motor repositioning programs, the ongoing impact of
the State integration activities, and the introduction of new water heater
products. For the first
                                       15
<PAGE>

quarter of 2003, net earnings are projected to modestly surpass last year's
$12.1 million result. However, given the impact from our second quarter 2002
stock offering, our first quarter earnings forecast of $.41 to $.45 per share
will fall short of last year's figure of $.50 per share.

OTHER MATTERS

Environmental
Our operations are governed by a number of federal, state, and local
environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous
materials, the discharge of pollutants into the environment, and remediation of
sites owned by the company or third parties. We have expended financial and
managerial resources complying with such laws. Expenditures related to
environmental matters were not material in 2002 and are not expected to be
material in any single year. Although we believe that our operations are
substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to
maintain compliance, there are no assurances that substantial additional costs
for compliance will not be incurred in the future. However, since the same laws
govern our competitors, we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage.

Market Risk
We are exposed to various types of market risks, primarily currency and certain
commodities. We monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and
generally enter into forward and futures contracts to minimize such exposures
for periods of less than one year. We do not engage in speculation in our
derivatives strategies. Further discussion regarding derivative instruments is
contained in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Commodity risks include raw material price fluctuations. We use futures
contracts to fix the cost of our expected needs with the objective of reducing
price risk. Futures contracts are purchased over time periods and at volume
levels which approximate expected usage. At December 31, 2002, we had commodity
futures contracts amounting to $56 million of commodity purchases. A
hypothetical 10 percent change in the underlying commodity price of such
contracts would have a potential impact of $5.6 million. It is important to note
that gains and losses from the company's futures contract activities will be
offset by gains and losses in the underlying commodity purchase transactions
being hedged.

In addition, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the
effect of fluctuating foreign currencies. At December 31, 2002, we had net
foreign currency contracts outstanding of $94.0 million. Assuming a hypothetical
10 percent movement in the respective currencies, the potential foreign exchange
gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to $9.4 million.
It is important to note that gains and losses from our forward contract
activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions
being hedged.

Our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily
derived from outstanding floating-rate debt instruments that are determined by
short-term money market rates. At December 31, 2002, we had $116.9 million in
outstanding floating-rate debt with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.0
percent at year end. A hypothetical 10 percent annual increase or decrease in
the year-end average cost of our outstanding floating-rate debt would result in
a change in annual pretax interest expense of $0.2 million.

Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains statements that we believe are "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such
as "may," "will," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "believe,"
"continue," "expectation," or words of similar meaning. These forward-looking
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this
filing. Factors that could cause such a variance include the following:
instability in our electric motor and water heater markets; inability to
generate the synergistic cost savings from the acquisition of State; the
inability to implement cost-reduction programs; adverse changes in general
economic conditions; significant increases in raw material prices; a regulatory
delay or a failure to comply with new flammable vapor ignition resistant
standards in the residential gas water heater industry;

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
A. O. Smith Corporation


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of A. O. Smith
Corporation as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at
Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
the company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of A. O. Smith
Corporation at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.

As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 2002, A. O. Smith Corporation changed its method of accounting for
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Organization. A. O. Smith Corporation (the company) is a manufacturer serving
customers worldwide. The company's major product lines include fractional and
integral horsepower alternating current (A/C), direct current (D/C), and
hermetic electric motors, as well as residential and commercial water heaters.
The company's products are manufactured and marketed primarily in North America.
Electric motors are sold principally to original equipment manufacturers and
industrial distributors. Water heaters are sold principally to plumbing
wholesalers and retail outlets.

Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany
transactions.

Use of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the accompanying financial statements and notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Fair value of financial instruments. The carrying amounts of cash and cash
equivalents, receivables, and trade payables approximated fair value as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, due to the short maturities of these instruments.
The carrying amount of long-term debt approximated fair value as of December 31,
2002 and 2001, based on current rates offered to the company for debt with the
same or similar maturities.

Foreign currency translation. For all subsidiaries outside the United States,
with the exception of Mexico and the China operations of the company's
Electrical Products segment, the company uses the local currency as the
functional currency. For those operations using a functional currency other than
the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at
year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at
weighted-average exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are
recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The Mexico and China
operations of the company's Electrical Products segment use the U.S. dollar as
the functional currency as such operations are a direct and integral component
of the company's U.S. operations. Gains and losses from foreign currency
transactions are included in net earnings.

Cash and cash equivalents. The company considers all highly liquid investments,
generally with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, to be cash
equivalents.

Inventory valuation. Inventories are carried at lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all
domestic inventories which comprise 92 percent and 93 percent of the company's
total inventory at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Inventories of
foreign subsidiaries and supplies are determined using the first-in, first-out
(FIFO) method.

Property, plant, and equipment. Property, plant, and equipment are stated at
cost. Depreciation is computed primarily by the straight-line method. The
estimated service lives used to compute depreciation are generally 25 to 50
years for buildings and 5 to 20 years for equipment. Maintenance and repair
costs are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and other intangibles. The company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"
effective January 1, 2002. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets (totaling $3.0 million at December 31, 2002) are no longer
amortized but are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. Separable
intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized
on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from 5 to
30 years.

                                       24
<PAGE>

1.   Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Impairment of long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Property, plant, and
equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected undiscounted
cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset or group of
assets, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and
carrying value of the asset or group of assets. Such analyses necessarily
involve significant judgment.

Derivative instruments. Effective January 1, 2001, the company adopted SFAS No.
133, as amended, which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on
the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and
effectiveness of the hedging relationships. Any fair value changes are recorded
in net earnings or other comprehensive earnings (loss). The cumulative effect of
adopting SFAS No. 133 was not material to the company's consolidated financial
statements as of January 1, 2001.

The company utilizes certain derivative instruments to enhance its ability to
manage currency exposures and raw materials price risks. Derivative instruments
are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures
and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does
not enter into contracts for speculative purposes. The contracts are executed
with major financial institutions with no credit loss anticipated for failure of
the counterparties to perform.

Commodity Future Contracts

In addition to entering into supply arrangements in the normal course of
business, the company also enters into futures contracts to fix the cost of
certain raw material purchases, principally copper, with the objective of
minimizing changes in cost due to market price fluctuations.

The commodity futures contracts are designated and accounted for as cash flow
hedges of a forecasted transaction. Derivative commodity liabilities of $1.8 and
$6.9 million are recorded in accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively, with the value of the effective portion of the contracts of
$1.7 and $6.9 million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings
(loss), net of tax, and reclassified into cost of products sold in the period in
which the underlying transaction is recorded in earnings. Ineffective portions
of the commodity hedges are recorded in earnings in the period in which the
ineffectiveness occurs. The impact of hedge ineffectiveness on earnings was not
material for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of
transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain
subsidiaries. The company utilizes foreign currency forward purchase and sale
contracts to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases,
sales, and certain intercompany transactions in the normal course of business.
Contracts typically have maturities of one year or less. Principal currencies
include the Mexican peso, Hungarian forint, British pound, Euro, and U.S.
dollar.

Forward contracts are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges of a
forecasted transaction. Derivative currency liabilities of $3.9 million as of
December 31, 2002, are recorded in other current liabilities, and derivative
currency assets of $6.6 million as of December 31, 2001, are recorded in other
current assets. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss), net of tax, until the
underlying transaction is recorded in earnings. When the hedged item is
realized, gains or losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive
earnings (loss) to the statement of earnings. The assessment of effectiveness
for forward contracts is based on changes in the forward rates. These hedges
have been determined to be perfectly effective.

1.   Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

The majority of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss)
for cash flow hedges is expected to be reclassified into earnings within one
year.

The following table summarizes, by currency, the contractual amounts of the
company's foreign currency forward contracts.

                                     =======   ======       =======   ======

The forward contracts in place at December 31, 2002 and 2001, amounted to
approximately 95 percent and 85 percent, respectively, of the company's
anticipated subsequent year exposure for those currencies hedged.

Revenue recognition. The company recognizes revenue upon transfer of title,
which generally occurs upon shipment of the product to the customer.

Compensated absences. In the fourth quarter of 2001 and the second quarter of
2000, the company changed its vacation policy for certain employees so that
vacation pay is earned ratably throughout the year and must be used by year-end.
The accrual for compensated absences was reduced by $1.6 and $2.3 million in
2001 and 2000, respectively, to eliminate vacation pay no longer required to be
accrued under the current policy.

Research and development. Research and development costs are charged to
operations as incurred and amounted to $30.4, $27.6, and $24.5 million during
2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

Product warranty. The company offers warranties on the sales of certain of its
products and records an accrual for estimated future claims. Such accruals are
based upon historical experience and management's estimate of the level of
future claims. The following table presents the company's product warranty
liability activity in 2002 and 2001:

                                               2002             2001

                                            ========         ========

Environmental costs. The company accrues for losses associated with
environmental obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably
estimable. Costs of estimated future expenditures are not discounted to their
present value. Recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recorded
as assets when their receipt is considered probable. The accruals are adjusted
as facts and circumstances change.

1.   Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Stock based compensation. The company has one stock-based employee compensation
plan (see Note 11). SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"
encourages, but does not require companies to record compensation cost for
stock-based employee compensation plans at fair value. The company has chosen to
continue applying Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations, in accounting for its
stock option plans. Accordingly, because the number of shares is fixed and the
exercise price of the stock options equals the market price of the underlying
stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense has been recognized.

Had compensation cost been determined based upon the fair value at the grant
date for awards under the plans based on the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the
company's pro forma earnings and earnings per share would have been as follows:

Reclassifications. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the 2002 presentation.

New accounting standards. During 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," SFAS No.
144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," SFAS No.
146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," and
SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and
Disclosure." SFAS No. 143 will become effective for the company on January 1,
2003. Adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on
the company's consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 144, which was adopted
on January 1, 2002, did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated
financial statements since its adoption. SFAS No. 146 will be effective for exit
or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. Adoption of this
statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company's

2.   Acquisitions

In 2002, the company acquired certain net assets of the Athens Products (Athens)
division of the Electrolux Group and the motor manufacturing assets of Jiangsu
Changheng Group Co. Ltd. (Changheng). The total cost of these acquisitions was
$25.0 million including future payments of $3.8 million and acquisition costs of
$0.1 million and exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired by $3.7
million which was recorded as non-deductible goodwill in the Electrical Products
segment. Athens, based in Athens, Tennessee, is a manufacturer of hermetic
motors for both scroll and reciprocating compressors. Changheng is located in
the JiangSu province of China and manufactures air-moving motors principally for
the Chinese air conditioning market.

The respective purchase prices for the Athens and Changheng acquisitions were
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon current
estimates of their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The
operating results of these companies have been included in the company's
consolidated financial statements since the dates of acquisition. The pro forma
effect of these acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, would not be
significant to 2002 or 2001 operating results.

On December 28, 2001, the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of State
Industries, Inc. (State). State is a manufacturer of residential and standard
commercial water heaters and has nearly doubled the size of the company's base
water heater business, while complementing the wholesale channel of distribution
with a strong presence in the retail market. The aggregate purchase price of
State was $117.6 million. This was comprised of $57.8 million for the
outstanding stock, assumption of $56.3 million of debt, and $3.5 million of
acquisition costs.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed in connection with the State acquisition. The
non-deductible goodwill has been recorded within the Water Systems segment. Of
the $3.9 million of acquired intangible assets, $3.0 million was assigned to
trademarks that are not subject to amortization.

2.   Acquisitions (continued)

The pro forma results have been prepared for informational purposes only and
include adjustments to depreciation expense of acquired plant and equipment,
amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill and trademarks, increased
interest expense on acquisition debt, and certain other adjustments, together
with related income tax effects of all such adjustments. Anticipated
efficiencies from the consolidation of manufacturing and commercial activities
and anticipated lower material costs related to the consolidation of purchasing
have been excluded from the pro forma operating results. These pro forma results
do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that would have
occurred had the acquisition been made as of the beginning of the period
presented or of the results of operations that may occur in the future.

In December 2001, the company acquired a 100 percent equity interest in Shenzhen
Speeda Industries Co., Ltd. and is utilizing the facility located in China to
manufacture C-frame electric motors. The total purchase price of $3.3 million,
including future payments of $0.7 million, exceeded the fair value of the assets
acquired (principally plant and equipment) by $0.8 million and was recorded as
non-deductible goodwill within the Electrical Products segment.

In connection with the acquisition of Athens, the company recorded purchase
liabilities of $4.2 million primarily for employee severance costs associated
with product manufacturing repositioning. As of December 31, 2002, $1.1 million
has been charged against this reserve. In connection with the Athens acquisition
and certain other acquisitions by the company, aggregate purchase liabilities of
$26.5 million were recorded at the respective acquisition dates for employee
severance and relocation, as well as certain facility exit costs. As of December
31, 2002, costs incurred and charged against these liabilities to date totaled
$17.1 million.

3.  Divestitures and Discontinued Operations

On January 17, 2000 (the measurement date), the company, with the approval of
its Board of Directors, decided to divest the company's fiberglass piping and
liquid and dry storage businesses. The combined net sales of these operations
were $129.3 million in 2000.

On December 8, 2000, the company sold the fiberglass piping business, operated
as Smith Fiberglass Products Company. On January 10, 2001, the company sold its
liquid and dry storage business, operated as Engineered Storage Products
Company. The net after-tax proceeds from the sale of these businesses were $62
million.

The components of the after-tax loss from discontinued operations included in
the consolidated statement of earnings are as follows:

Year ended December 31, 2000 (dollars in thousands)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Earnings from operations:
   Engineered Storage Products Company                            $  3,139
Loss on disposition:
   Smith Fiberglass Products Company                                (9,032)
   Engineered Storage Products Company                              (1,993)
   Automotive Products Company                                      (4,017)
                                                                  --------
Net after-tax loss from discontinued operations                   $(11,903)
                                                                  ========

Certain expenses have been allocated to the operations of the discontinued
businesses, including interest expense, which was allocated based on the ratio
of net assets of the discontinued businesses to the total consolidated capital
of the company.

The $9.0 million additional loss recorded at the time of the disposition of the
fiberglass piping business in 2000 resulted from recognition of sales proceeds
substantially less than originally anticipated, as the acquisition financing
market, both generally and specific to the potential buyer, deteriorated to the
point where the original transaction was not feasible. Subsequently, a sales
contract containing a substantial reduction in sales proceeds and other
concessions made by the company relative to the assumption of certain future
costs was negotiated.

<PAGE>

3.   Divestitures and Discontinued Operations (continued)

An after-tax loss from operations (in an amount greater than what was originally
anticipated as of the measurement date) of $0.5 million is included in the $9.0
million loss on disposition in 2000.

As a result of difficult financing conditions prevalent late in 2000, certain
prospective buyers for the storage business withdrew from active negotiations
resulting in a single interested buyer. The company agreed to price concessions
to successfully complete its exit from this business and resulted in an
unanticipated after-tax loss on disposition for this business of $2.0 million.

The $4.0 million after-tax loss on disposition for the automotive business
consists of two items: $2.8 million ($4.0 million pretax) for workers
compensation costs associated with increased claims having an occurrence date
prior to the 1997 sale of the automotive business for which the company retained
responsibility per the sales contract; and $1.2 million ($2.0 million pretax)
for final settlement of a purchase price dispute in the amount of $7.6 million
for which a $5.6 million pretax reserve had been established at the time of
sale. The $2.8 million adjustment for workers compensation costs was incremental
to a $12.3 million reserve for workers compensation retained by the company at
the time of sale.

Included in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002, are net current
liabilities of $1.6 million and net long-term liabilities of $1.7 million.
Included in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2001, are net current
assets of $1.8 million and net long-term liabilities of $2.1 million.

4.   Business Improvement Programs

In the fourth quarter of 2001, the company recorded restructuring and other
charges of $9.4 million ($6.0 million after-tax, or $.25 per share). The charges
include employee separation costs of $7.7 million associated with product or
component manufacturing repositioning and the realignment of certain
administrative functions. The resulting reduction of workforce is expected to
approximate 150 salaried and 775 hourly employees. In addition, the company
recorded facility impairment and lease charges of $1.7 million representing
estimated costs of facilities to be vacated. The company spent $2.9 million
through December 31, 2002, for employee severance and separation costs. At
December 31, 2002, the company estimates approximately 500 employees are yet to
be impacted and plans to be substantially completed with the business
improvement activities prior to December 31, 2003.

8.   Goodwill

In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the company completed the first
step of the transitional goodwill impairment test, which required the company to
compare the fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of the net
assets of the respective reporting units as of January 1, 2002. Based on this
analysis, the company concluded that no impairment existed at the time of
adoption, and, accordingly, the company has not recognized any transitional
impairment loss. Additionally, the company concluded that no impairment existed
at the time of the annual impairment test which was performed in the fourth
quarter.

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the year ended December 31,
2002, consist of the following:

The company has a $250 million multi-year revolving credit agreement with a
group of nine financial institutions, which expires on August 2, 2004. It also
has a $82.5 million 364-day credit agreement with a group of six banks, which
expires on July 25, 2003. At its option, the company maintains either cash
balances or pays fees for bank credit and services.

The company's credit agreements and term notes contain certain conditions and
provisions which restrict the company's payment of dividends. Under the most
restrictive of these provisions, retained earnings of $92 million were
unrestricted as of December 31, 2002.

9.   Long-Term Debt and Lease Commitments (continued)

Borrowings under the bank credit lines and in the commercial paper market that
are supported by the multi-year revolving credit agreement have been classified
as long-term. It has been the company's practice to renew or replace the
revolving credit agreement so as to maintain the availability of debt on a
long-term basis and to provide 100 percent backup for its borrowings in the
commercial paper market.

Scheduled maturities of long-term debt within each of the five years subsequent
to December 31, 2002, is as follows: 2003-$11.7; 2004-$8.6; 2005-$8.6;
2006-$6.9; 2007-$6.9 million.

Future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases total $66.3 million
and are due as follows: 2003-$14.3; 2004-$12.1; 2005-$8.8; 2006-$6.8; 2007-$6.0
and thereafter - $18.3 million. Rent expense including payments under operating
leases, was $22.0, $19.0, and $18.3 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively.

Interest paid by the company for continuing and discontinued operations, was
$13.9, $16.9, and $24.6 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

10.  Stockholders' Equity

The company's authorized capital consists of 3 million shares of Preferred Stock
$1 par value, 14 million shares of Class A Common Stock $5 par value, and 60
million shares of Common Stock $1 par value. The Common Stock has equal dividend
rights with Class A Common Stock and is entitled, as a class, to elect 25
percent of the Board of Directors and has 1/10th vote per share on all other
matters.

On May 10, 2002, the company completed the sale of 4,776,065 shares of Common
Stock held in treasury. The $127.5 million net proceeds from the offering were
used to reduce long-term debt.

During 2002, 2001, and 2000, 91,049, 36,236, and 200 shares, respectively, of
Class A Common Stock were converted into Common Stock. Regular dividends paid on
the Class A Common Stock and Common Stock amounted to $.54, $.52, and $.50 per
share in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

At December 31, 2002, 32,595 and 3,476,844, shares of Class A Common Stock and
Common Stock, respectively, were held as treasury stock. At December 31, 2001,
32,595 and 8,730,594 shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock,
respectively, were held as treasury stock.

11.  Stock Options

The company adopted the A. O. Smith Combined Executive Incentive Compensation
Plan (the "plan") effective January 1, 2002. The plan supercedes and replaces
two predecessor incentive compensation plans. The plan provides for the issuance
of 1.5 million stock options at exercise prices equal to the fair value of
Common Stock on the date of grant. Additionally, any shares that would have been
available for stock option grants under either of the predecessor plans, if such
plans were in effect, will be available for granting of stock option awards
under the plan. The options granted become exercisable one year from date of
grant and, for active employees, expire ten years after date of grant. The
number of shares available for granting of options at December 31, 2002, was
1,325,850.

Participants may also be awarded shares of restricted stock under the plan. In
2002, the company granted 49,000 shares of restricted common stock under the
plan. The restricted shares were valued at $1.3 million at the date of issuance
and will be recognized as compensation expense ratably over the three-year
vesting period. Compensation expense of $0.1 million was recognized in 2002.

Changes in option shares, all of which are Common Stock, were as follows:

12.  Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits

The company provides retirement benefits for all United States employees. Plan
assets consist primarily of marketable equities and debt securities. The company
also has several foreign pension plans, none of which are material to the
company's financial position. Effective January 1, 2001, the company changed its
Executive Supplemental Pension Plan (ESPP) to an unfunded defined-benefit plan.

The company has a defined-contribution profit sharing and retirement plan
covering the majority of its salaried nonunion employees which provides for
annual company contributions of 35 percent to 140 percent of qualifying
contributions made by participating employees. The amount of the company's
contribution in excess of 35 percent is dependent upon the company's
profitability. The company also has defined-contribution plans for certain
hourly employees which provide for annual matching company contributions.

On December 28, 2001, the company acquired State, including its pension and
defined-contribution benefit plans.

The company has several unfunded defined-benefit post-retirement plans covering
certain hourly and salaried employees that provide medical and life insurance
benefits from retirement to age 65. Certain hourly employees retiring after
January 1, 1996, are subject to a maximum annual benefit and salaried employees
hired after December 31, 1993, are not eligible for post-retirement medical
benefits. As a result, a one percentage point change in the health care cost
trend rate would not have a significant effect on the amounts reported. The
post-retirement benefit obligation was determined using an assumed healthcare
cost trend rate of eight percent in 2002 trending down to six percent in 2004
and thereafter.

The following tables present the changes in benefit obligations, plan assets,
funded status, and major assumptions used to determine these amounts for
domestic pension and post-retirement plans and components of net periodic
benefit costs.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value
of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in
excess of plan assets were $703,909, $686,565, and $592,759, respectively, as of
December 31, 2002, and $71,561, $68,104, and $48,899, respectively, as of
December 31, 2001.

The accumulated benefit obligations related to the company's pension plans
exceeded the fair value of the plans' assets by $88,713 as of December 31, 2002.
This under-funded status is primarily due to the impact of recent declines in
the U.S. equity markets, which resulted in a drop in the fair value of pension
assets; and declines in interest rates, which resulted in an increase in the
present value of pension obligations.

As a result of the under-funded status, the company recorded a charge to
stockholders' equity of $114,740, representing the elimination of the prepaid
pension asset, the establishment of a liability for under-funding, as well as
the related deferred income tax impacts. This non-cash charge has no impact on
income or cash flow. While declines in the equity markets and interest rates had
a significant impact on the funded status of the plans, the pension plans
continue to meet all funding requirements under ERISA regulations, and under
current assumptions, no significant minimum funding requirement is expected for
several years.

considered to be permanently invested. At December 31, 2002, the undistributed
earnings amounted to $52.4 million. Determination of the amount of unrecognized
deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings is not practicable. In
addition, no provision or benefit for U.S. income taxes have been made on
foreign currency translation gains or losses.

The tax effects of temporary differences of assets and liabilities between
income tax and financial reporting are as follows:

These deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as
current or long-term based on the balance sheet classification of the related
assets and liabilities as follows:

As a result of the acquisition of State, the company has $5.8 million of federal
net operating loss carryovers that expire between 2018 and 2021, $7.6 million of
federal capital loss carryovers that expire in 2006, $0.5 million of
contribution carryovers that expire between 2003 and 2006, and $2.9 million of
tax credits, the majority of which have an unlimited carryover period. Due to a
change in State ownership, the annual limitation for utilization of the federal
net operating loss carryovers is the equivalent of $2.2 million of deductions.

The company also has approximately $125 million of state and local net operating
loss carryovers. The majority of these carryovers expire between 2010 and 2022.

14.  Litigation and Insurance Matters

The company is involved in various unresolved legal actions, administrative
proceedings, and claims in the ordinary course of its business involving product
liability, property damage, insurance coverage, patents, and environmental
matters including the disposal of hazardous waste. Although it is not possible
to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the
range of possible loss or recovery, the company believes these unresolved legal
actions will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of
operations. The following paragraphs summarize noteworthy actions and
proceedings.

In 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court,
Western District of Missouri, by individuals on behalf of themselves and all
persons throughout the United States who have owned or currently own a water
heater manufactured by Rheem Manufacturing Company, A. O. Smith Corporation,
Bradford White Company, American Water Heater Company, Lochinvar Corporation,
and State Industries, Inc. (the "water heater manufacturers") that contains a
dip tube manufactured, designed, supplied, or sold by Perfection Corporation
between August 1993 and October 1996. A dip tube is a plastic tube in a
residential water heater that brings the cold water supply to the bottom area of
the tank to be heated. The plaintiffs and the water heater manufacturers reached
a settlement of this lawsuit which the court approved in 2000. The water heater
manufacturers paid the settlement, and all other legal actions brought against
the water heater manufacturers related to dip tube claims have been dismissed as
a result of the settlement of the class action.

Separately, the water heater manufacturers in late 1999 filed a direct action
lawsuit in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, State of
Louisiana, against Perfection Corporation and American Meter Company, the parent
company of Perfection, Manner Plastics Materials, Inc., and their insurers. This
lawsuit seeks (1) recovery of damages sustained by the water heater
manufacturers related to the costs of the class action settlement and the
handling of dip tube claims outside of and prior to the national class action
settlement, (2) damages for the liability of the water heater manufacturers
assumed by Perfection Corporation by contract, and (3) personal injuries
suffered by the water heater manufacturers as a result of the disparagement of
their businesses. Also relating to the water heater manufacturers' recovery
efforts, the insurers of Perfection Corporation have brought third-party claims
against the water heater manufacturers in a state court action in Cook County,
Illinois.

Perfection Corporation has also sued the water heater manufacturers in a
separate action in Cook County, Illinois. The filing by Perfection Corporation
is an attempt to preempt the Louisiana lawsuit.

14.  Litigation and Insurance Matters (continued)

As of December 31, 2002, the company recorded as a long-term receivable
approximately $34.0 million (as detailed below) related to dip tube repair
claims, administrative costs, legal fees, and related expenses. It is the
company's expectation that all or a substantial portion of its costs will be
recovered from Perfection, American Meter Company, Manner Plastics Materials,
Inc. and their insurers, as well as the company's insurers.

</TABLE>

The company is currently involved as a potentially responsible party (PRP) in
judicial and administrative proceedings initiated on behalf of various state and
federal regulatory agencies seeking to clean up 11 sites which have been
environmentally impacted (the "sites") and to recover costs they have incurred
or will incur as to the sites. The company previously reported that it was a
defendant in two separate lawsuits involving a former mine in Colorado that is
being remediated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The
claims against the company have been dismissed by the trial court in both of
those actions. The State of Colorado has appealed the trial court's decision in
one of those actions, and the company believes that the trial court's
well-reasoned decision will be upheld by the appellate court. Since the EPA has
indicated that it does not intend to pursue any claims against the company with
respect to this site, the company should have no further potential liability
with respect to the site.

It is impossible at this time to estimate the total cost of remediation for the
sites or the company's ultimate share of those costs, primarily because the
sites are in various stages of the remediation process and issues remain open at
many sites concerning the selection and implementation of the final remedy, the
cost of that remedy and the company's liability at a site relative to the
liability and viability of the other PRPs. The company has established reserves
for the sites in a manner that is consistent with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States for costs associated with such cleanups
when those costs are capable of being reasonably estimated. To the best of the
company's knowledge, the reserves it has established and insurance proceeds that
are available to the company are sufficient to cover the company's liability.
The company further believes its insurers have the financial ability to pay any
such covered claims, and there are viable PRPs at each of the sites which have
the financial ability to pay their respective shares of liability at the sites.

With respect to non-environmental claims, the company has self-insured a portion
of its product liability loss exposure and other business risks for many years.
The company has established reserves which it believes are adequate to cover
incurred claims. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the company (excluding
State) had $125 million of third-party product liability insurance for
individual losses in excess of $1.5 million and for aggregate annual losses in
excess of $10 million; State had $125 million of third-party product liability
insurance for individual losses in excess of $3.0 million and for aggregate
annual losses in excess of $65 million. The company periodically reevaluates its
exposure on claims and makes adjustments to its reserves as appropriate.

15.  Operations by Segment

The company has two reportable segments: Electrical Products and Water Systems.
The Electrical Products segment manufactures fractional horsepower alternating
current (A/C) and direct current (D/C) and integral horsepower motors used in
fans and blowers in furnaces, air conditioners, and ventilating systems;
industrial applications such as material handling; as well as in other consumer
products such as home appliances and pumps, swimming pools, hot tubs, and spas.
In addition, the Electrical Products segment manufactures hermetic motors which
are sold worldwide to manufacturers of compressors used in air conditioning and
refrigeration systems. The Water Systems segment manufactures residential gas
and electric water heaters as well as commercial water heating equipment used in
a wide range of applications including hotels, laundries, car washes, factories,
and large institutions. In addition, the Water Systems segment manufactures
copper tube boilers used in large-volume hot water and hydronic heating
applications.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those
described in the "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" outlined in Note
1. Intersegment sales have been excluded from segment revenues and are
immaterial. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is used to measure the
performance of the segments and allocate resources.
