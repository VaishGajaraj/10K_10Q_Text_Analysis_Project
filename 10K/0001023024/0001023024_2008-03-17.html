We also are engaged in the development of our proprietary calcium phosphate nanotechnology, or CaP,
primarily for aesthetic medicine, novel vaccines and drug delivery.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our hormone therapy products address a variety of hormone therapies for symptoms that affect both
men and women, with an emphasis on women. Symptoms addressed by these hormone therapies in women
include sexual dysfunction (hypoactive sexual desire disorder) and hot flashes. The products are
gel formulations of testosterone, estradiol and various combinations of testosterone and estradiol.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The gels are designed to be quickly absorbed through the skin after application on the upper arm
for the women&#146;s products, delivering the hormone to the bloodstream evenly and in a non-invasive,
painless manner. The gels are formulated to be applied once per day, to be absorbed into the skin
without a trace of residue and to dry within one to two minutes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In order to market our hormone therapy products in the United States, we are required to obtain
approval of a new drug application (NDA)&nbsp;or an abbreviated NDA (ANDA)&nbsp;for each such product from
the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). With respect to Elestrin, we submitted an
NDA in February&nbsp;2006 and received non-conditional and full approval of the NDA from the FDA in
December&nbsp;2006 with no Phase IV development commitments. In addition, we received three years of
marketing exclusivity for Elestrin. In November&nbsp;2006, we entered into an exclusive agreement with
Bradley Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for the marketing of Elestrin in the United States. Effective
February&nbsp;21, 2008, Nycomed US Inc. completed its acquisition of Bradley. As a result, all
references to Bradley have been changed to Nycomed in this report. Nycomed commercially launched
Elestrin in the U.S. in June&nbsp;2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Prior to submitting an NDA or ANDA for our other hormone therapy products, the products must
undergo additional human clinical trials. LibiGel successfully has completed a Phase II clinical
trial, and we began the first of two Phase III safety and efficacy clinical trials in December&nbsp;2006
and a separate safety study in January&nbsp;2008. We believe based on FDA discussions, meetings and
agreements, including a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA)&nbsp;received in January&nbsp;2008, that two Phase
III safety and efficacy
trials and one year of LibiGel exposure in a separate safety study with a four-year follow-up
post-NDA filing and potentially post-FDA approval are the essential requirements for submission
and, if successful, approval by the FDA of an NDA for LibiGel.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Hormone therapy is used to relieve one or more symptoms caused by declining or low hormone levels.
Symptoms addressed by hormone therapies include female sexual dysfunction and menopausal symptoms
in women, including hot flashes, vaginal atrophy and impotence, lack of sex drive and muscle
weakness in men. The primary goal of hormone therapy is to safely and effectively relieve these
dysfunctions and symptoms with minimal side effects.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Testosterone Therapy for Women</I></B>. Although generally characterized as a male hormone, testosterone
also is present in women and its deficiency has been found to cause low libido or sex drive.
Studies have shown that testosterone therapy in women can boost sexual desire, sexual activity and
pleasure, increase bone density, raise energy levels and improve mood. According to a study
published in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I>, 43&nbsp;percent of American women between
the ages of 18 &#151; 59, or about 40&nbsp;million, experience some degree of impaired sexual function.
Among the more than 1,400 women surveyed, 32&nbsp;percent lacked interest in sex (low sexual desire) and
26&nbsp;percent could not experience orgasm. Furthermore, according to a study published in the <I>New
England Journal of Medicine</I>, 43&nbsp;percent of American women between the ages of 57 &#151; 85 experience
low sexual desire. Importantly, according to IMS data, 1.4&nbsp;million testosterone prescriptions were
written off-label for women by U.S. physicians in 2006. Female sexual dysfunction, or FSD, is
defined as a lack of sexual desire, arousal or pleasure. The majority of women with FSD are
postmenopausal, experiencing symptoms due to hormonal changes that occur with aging or following
surgical menopause.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">There is no pharmaceutical product currently approved in the United States for FSD. While several
therapies have been tested to treat FSD, thus far testosterone therapy appears to be the only
treatment that results in a consistent significant increase in the number of satisfying sexual
events in women, which represents one of the two key efficacy endpoints chosen by the FDA for
pivotal clinical trials of FSD therapies. We are not aware of another testosterone therapy product
for the treatment of FSD in development other than LibiGel.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2004, the FDA&#146;s Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee panel voted unanimously
against recommending the approval of Procter &#038; Gamble&#146;s Intrinsa testosterone patch for hypoactive
sexual desire disorder (HSDD). The panel&#146;s main concern was a desire to have available additional
safety data particularly as it pertains to potential increased risk of cardiovascular disease and
breast cancer in women treated chronically with testosterone in combination with estrogen. Despite
the recommendation not to approve Intrinsa, the panel voted that Intrinsa provides a clinically
meaningful benefit for women with HSDD. Procter &#038; Gamble withdrew its NDA for Intrinsa and it is
our understanding that Procter &#038; Gamble completed two additional Phase III studies in over 1,000
naturally menopausal women (i.e., with an intact uterus) as well as additional Phase III studies in
different patient populations for a total of five Phase III clinical trials. However, to date, we
are not aware of any clinical activity by Procter &#038; Gamble to
provide the required safety data. Procter &#038; Gamble received European regulatory approval for its Intrinsa patch in July&nbsp;2006 and
began marketing the product in Europe during the first half of 2007. It is our understanding that
Procter &#038; Gamble has not made any final decision as to whether it will continue to pursue
regulatory approval of Intrinsa in the United States.

Assessment (SPA)&nbsp;received in January&nbsp;2008 regarding LibiGel, we believe two Phase III safety and
efficacy trials and one year of LibiGel exposure in a separate safety study with a four-year
follow-up post-NDA filing and potentially post-FDA approval are the essential requirements for
submission and, if successful, approval by the FDA of an NDA for LibiGel.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Estrogen and Combined Estrogen Therapy for Women</I></B>. According to The North American Menopause
Society, there are more than 40&nbsp;million postmenopausal women in the U.S., and this group is
expected to grow 25&nbsp;percent by 2010. Menopause begins when the ovaries cease to produce estrogen,
or when both ovaries are removed surgically prior to natural menopause. The average age at which
women experience natural menopause is 51&nbsp;years. The average age of surgical menopause is 41&nbsp;years.
The most common physical symptoms of natural or surgical menopause and the resultant estrogen
deficiency are hot flashes, vaginal atrophy and osteoporosis. According to the North American
Menopause Society, recent studies show that hot flashes occur in approximately two-thirds of
menopausal women. Hormone therapy in women decreases the chance that women will experience the
symptoms of menopause due to estrogen deficiency. According to industry estimates, approximately
six million women in the U.S. currently are receiving some form of estrogen or combined estrogen
hormone therapy. According to IMS Health, the current market in the U.S. for single-entity
estrogen products was approximately $1.4&nbsp;billion in 2007, of which the transdermal segment, mostly
patches, is reported at about $260&nbsp;million. As the &#147;baby boomer&#148; generation ages, the number of
women reaching menopause, a large percentage of whom may need estrogen or combined estrogen
therapy, is between 5,000 and 6,000 women per day in the U.S.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">There are several treatment options for women experiencing menopausal symptoms, which vary
according to which symptoms a woman experiences and whether or not she has had a hysterectomy.
Estrogen is most commonly given orally in pill or tablet form. There are several potential side
effects, however, with the use of oral estrogen, including insufficient absorption by the
circulatory system, stomach upset, gallstones, blood clots as well as an increase in C-reactive
protein, a possible marker for cardiovascular inflammation. Recent reports suggest that oral
estrogen causes an increase in strokes and blood clots. Although transdermal, or skin, patches
have been shown to avoid some of these problems or effects, transdermal patches have a physical
presence, can fall off, and can result in skin irritation. However, transdermal delivery of
estrogen via patches or gels may reduce the risks associated with oral estrogen, including having
no effect on C-reactive protein and potentially reduce the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular
disease.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Women who have not had a hysterectomy must take estrogen in combination with progestogen (either
progestin or progesterone) as estrogen alone may increase endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial
cancer risks. In July&nbsp;2002, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)&nbsp;released data from its Women&#146;s
Health Initiative (WHI)&nbsp;study on the risks and benefits associated with long-term use of oral
hormone
(conjugated estrogen plus progestin) therapy. The NIH announced that it was discontinuing the arm
of the study investigating the use of the estrogen/progestogen tablet combination from the WHI
study because Prempro<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>, the combination oral estrogen/progestogen therapy product used
in the study, was shown to cause an increase in the risk of invasive breast cancer after an average
follow-up period of 5.2&nbsp;years. The study also found an increased risk of stroke, heart attacks and
blood clots and concluded that overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of the orally
delivered combined estrogen plus progestogen product among healthy postmenopausal women. Also in
July&nbsp;2002, the National Cancer Institute (NCI)&nbsp;published the results of an observational study in
which it found that postmenopausal women who used estrogen therapy for 10 or more years had a
higher risk of developing ovarian cancer than women who never used hormone therapy. The markets
for female hormone therapies for menopausal symptoms declined as a result of these published
studies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In March&nbsp;2004, the NIH announced that the estrogen-alone arm of the study was discontinued after
nearly seven years because the NIH concluded that estrogen alone does not affect (either increase
or decrease) heart disease, the major question being evaluated in the study. The findings
indicated a slightly increased risk of stroke as well as a decreased risk of hip fracture and
breast cancer. Preliminary data from the memory portion of the WHI study suggested that estrogen
alone may possibly be associated with a slight increase in the risk of dementia or mild cognitive
impairment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Recently published results suggest that age has an effect on these results and women who begin
estrogen therapy in their fifties might in fact see a decrease in the risk of heart disease and
breast cancer. The WHI studies were conducted using only oral conjugated estrogen.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In May&nbsp;2006, data from the Nurses&#146; Health Study (NHS)&nbsp;were published in the <I>Archives of Internal
Medicine </I>showing no increase in invasive breast cancer risk among postmenopausal hysterectomized
women who used estrogen-alone therapy for less than 10&nbsp;years. The NHS researchers also reported a
nonsignificant decrease in breast cancer risk among current estrogen therapy users for five to 9.9
years. These data are consistent with the recent findings on estrogen therapy and breast cancer
that were published from the Women&#146;s Health Initiative (WHI)&nbsp;Estrogen Therapy (ET)&nbsp;sub-study. The
NHS is a large prospective cohort study of over 120,000 registered nurses in the United States.
There were 11,508 women who had a hysterectomy and reported information on estrogen use at baseline
in 1980. The study population was expanded every two years as NHS participants reported having a
hysterectomy and becoming menopausal. By the final follow-up period (2000- 2002), there were 28,835
women being followed in the study.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In February&nbsp;2007, the medical journal <I>Circulation </I>published data suggesting the risks of hormones
are dramatically reduced when the drugs are absorbed through the skin in patches and gels rather
than taken as pills. The study by French researchers showed that one of the most serious risks
associated with hormone use &#151; blood clots &#151; could be virtually eliminated if women switch to a
skin-delivery system like the patch. It is estimated that more than six million U.S. women use
menopause hormones to relieve hot flashes and other symptoms. Although hormone drugs come in
pills, patches, gels, a lotion and rings, the vast majority of U.S. women use the pill form.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Among the 881 women studied in the <I>Circulation </I>report, researchers found that women who took oral
hormone pills were four times as likely to suffer a serious blood clot. Women who used transdermal
hormone patches or gels were at no higher risk for blood clots than women who did not take hormones
at all. The research, collected from a continuing study called ESTHER (which stands for Estrogen
and Thromboembolism Risk), was funded primarily by French government health agencies and also
received some support from drug companies that make patch treatments. The women studied were
taking either estrogen only or an estrogen-and-progestin combination.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As a result of the findings from the WHI and other studies, the FDA has required that &#147;black box&#148;
labeling be included on all hormone therapy products marketed in the United States to warn, among
other things, that these products have been associated with increased risks for heart disease,
heart attacks, strokes, and breast cancer and that they are not approved for heart disease
prevention. In addition, NIH guidelines, which are supported by many physicians and the FDA, as
well as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)&nbsp;and the North American
Menopause Society (NAMS), recommend hormone therapy for treating menopausal symptoms in the lowest
dose possible for the shortest duration of time consistent with therapeutic goals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The primary advantage of transdermal estrogen therapy products over oral products is that the
estrogen avoids the &#147;first pass&#148; through the liver where it may have certain negative effects and
it avoids being metabolized and losing potency, thereby allowing a lower dosage of hormone to be
used. In addition, unlike the oral products containing conjugated estrogens, which were evaluated
in the NIH trials, transdermal products, such as our Elestrin, use estradiol which is identical to
the estrogen produced naturally by a woman&#146;s ovaries. No studies to date have evaluated the
long-term effects of transdermal estrogen alone. Despite the lack of such studies, however, the
FDA has approved several transdermal estrogen or estrogen combined with progestogen products,
including transdermal patches, manufactured by Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Berlex Laboratories,
Inc., Mylan Laboratories, Inc., Novartis Pharma AG, Pfizer Inc., and Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;
transdermal gels marketed by Ascend Therapeutics, Inc. and Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc. and our
Elestrin transdermal gel marketed by Nycomed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Testosterone Therapy for Men</I></B>. Testosterone deficiency in men is known as hypogonadism. Low levels
of testosterone may result in lethargy, depression, decreased sex drive, impotence, low sperm count
and increased irritability. Men with severe and prolonged reduction of testosterone also may
experience loss of body hair, reduced muscle mass, osteoporosis and bone fractures due to
osteoporosis. Approximately five million men in the United States, primarily over age 40, have
lower than normal levels of testosterone. Testosterone therapy has been shown to restore levels of
testosterone with minimal side effects.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">There are currently several products on the market for the treatment of low testosterone levels in
men. As opposed to estrogen therapy products, oral administration of testosterone is currently not
possible as the hormone is, for the most part, rendered inactive in the liver making it difficult
to achieve adequate levels of the compound in the bloodstream. Current methods of administration
include testosterone injections, patches and gels. Testosterone injections require large needles,
are often painful and not effective for maintaining adequate testosterone blood levels throughout
the day. Delivery of testosterone through transdermal patches was developed primarily to promote
the therapeutic effects of testosterone therapy without the often painful side effects associated
with testosterone injections. Transdermal patches, however, similar to estrogen patches, have a
physical presence, can fall off, and can result in skin irritation. Testosterone formulated gel
products for men are designed to deliver testosterone without the pain of injections and the
physical presence, skin irritation and discomfort associated with transdermal patches. We are
aware of two gel testosterone products for men currently on the market in the United States.
According to IMS Health, the U.S. market for transdermal testosterone therapies grew approximately
22&nbsp;percent in 2007 to $624&nbsp;million from $510&nbsp;million in 2006. We have entered into a development
and license agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., pursuant to which Teva USA agreed to
develop our male testosterone gel, Bio-T-Gel, for the U.S. market.

dysfunction, specifically hypoactive sexual desire disorder. The majority of women with FSD are
postmenopausal, experiencing FSD due to hormonal changes due to aging or following surgical
menopause. LibiGel successfully has completed a Phase II clinical trial, and we began the first of
two Phase III safety and efficacy clinical trials in December&nbsp;2006, a separate safety study in
January&nbsp;2008 and plan to begin the second safety and efficacy trial in the first half of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our Phase II LibiGel trial was a U.S.-based, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 46 women to
determine the effect of LibiGel on women&#146;s sexual activity. Our Phase II trial showed
statistically significant results for the primary endpoint of the study. In the trial, there was a
238&nbsp;percent increase from baseline (p&#060;0.0001) in the frequency of satisfying sexual events as
measured by individual patient diaries. This increase also was significant versus placebo (p&#060;
0.05). The data indicate an effective LibiGel dose for the treatment of HSDD in women, and that
LibiGel was well tolerated during the course of the trial, and had a safety profile similar to that
of the placebo, with no women discontinuing use due to adverse events.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We believe based on FDA discussions, meetings and agreements including a Special Protocol
Assessment (SPA)&nbsp;received in January&nbsp;2008 that two Phase III safety and efficacy trials and one
year of LibiGel exposure in a separate safety study with a four year follow-up post-NDA filing and
potentially post-FDA approval are the essential requirements for submission and, if successful,
approval by the FDA of an NDA for LibiGel. In January&nbsp;2008, we announced that we successfully
completed and reached agreement with the FDA under the Special Protocol Assessment process for our
Phase III safety and efficacy clinical trials for LibiGel in the treatment of FSD, specifically,
HSDD. The SPA process and agreement affirms that the FDA agrees that the LibiGel Phase III
clinical trial design, clinical endpoints, sample size, planned conduct and statistical analyses
are acceptable to support regulatory approval. Further, it provides assurance that these agreed
measures will serve as the basis for regulatory review and the decision by the FDA to approve an
NDA for LibiGel. The SPA agreement covers the pivotal Phase III safety and efficacy trials of
LibiGel<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"> </SUP>in the treatment of FSD. These SPA trials use our validated instruments to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We initiated the Phase III cardiovascular safety study in January&nbsp;2008. The safety study is a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, cardiovascular events driven study of
between 2,400 and 3,100 women exposed to LibiGel or placebo for 12&nbsp;months. The safety study will
track a list of cardiovascular events including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and
stroke in women 50&nbsp;years of age or older and suffering from at least one cardiovascular risk factor
including hypertension or diabetes. The objective of the safety study is to show the relative
safety of testosterone compared to placebo in the number of cardiovascular events. The incidence of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Elestrin</I></B>. Our estrogen formulated gel product, Elestrin, is a once daily gel that delivers
estrogen without the skin irritation associated with, and the physical presence of, transdermal
patches, and to avoid the effects of oral estrogen. Elestrin contains estradiol versus conjugated
equine estrogen contained in the most commonly prescribed oral estrogen.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2006, we received FDA approval for the marketing of Elestrin in the United States.
Elestrin is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes)
associated with menopause. Elestrin is administered using a metered dose applicator that delivers
0.87 grams of gel per actuation, thereby allowing for precise titration from dose to dose. Two
doses of Elestrin, 0.87 grams per day and 1.7 grams per day, were approved by the FDA. Elestrin
0.87 grams, that delivers 12.5 mcg of estradiol per day, is one of the lowest daily doses of
estradiol approved by the FDA for the treatment of hot flashes and is 50&nbsp;percent lower than the
lowest dose, FDA-approved estrogen patch on the market. The Elestrin FDA approval was a
non-conditional and full approval with no Phase IV development commitments. In addition, we
received three years of marketing exclusivity for Elestrin.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We believe our CaP technology can serve as a facial line filler in the area of aesthetic medicine
and as an effective vehicle for delivering drugs and vaccines and enhancing the effects of
vaccines. Our CaP nanoparticles successfully have passed the first stage of toxicity studies for
administration orally, into muscles, under the skin, and into the lungs by inhalation. We
successfully have completed a Phase I human clinical safety trial of CaP. We have entered into
several subcontract or development agreements with various corporate partners and governmental
entities concerning our CaP technology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Overview of CaP Technology</I></B>. Research and development involving our CaP technology originated in a
project under an agreement dated April&nbsp;6, 1989 between the University of California and one of our
predecessor companies, relating to viral protein surface absorption studies. The discovery
research was funded at UCLA School of Medicine and was based, in essence, on the use of extremely
small, solid, uniform particles as components that could increase the stability of drugs and act as
systems to deliver drugs into the body. Research in these areas at UCLA or our laboratory has
resulted in the issuance of a number of patents, which we either license from the University of
California or own.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">These ultra fine particles are made from inert, biologically acceptable materials, such as
ceramics, pure crystalline carbon or biodegradable calcium phosphate-like particles. The size of
the particles is in the nanometer range. A nanometer is one millionth of a millimeter and
typically particles measure approximately 300 nanometers (nm). Because the size of these particles
is measured in nanometers, we use the term &#147;nanoparticles&#148; to describe them.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We use the nanoparticles as the basis of a delivery system. The critical property of these
nanoparticles is that biologically active molecules, proteins, peptides or pharmacological agents,
for example, vaccine components like bacterial or viral antigens or proteins like insulin, attached
to them, retain their activity and can be protected from natural alterations to their molecular
structure by adverse environmental conditions. It has been shown in studies conducted by us and
confirmed by others that when these combinations are injected into animals, the attachment can
enhance the biological activity as compared to injection of the molecule alone.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Aesthetic Medicine. </I></B>In November&nbsp;2007, we signed a license agreement covering the use of our CaP as
a facial filler (BioLook) in aesthetic medicine. The license was signed with Medical Aesthetics
Technology Corporation (MATC)&nbsp;with whom we previously had been working in the field of aesthetic
medicine under an option agreement. Under the license agreement, MATC is responsible for continued
development of BioLook, including required clinical trials, regulatory filings and all
manufacturing and marketing associated with the product. In exchange for this license, we have
taken an ownership position in MATC of approximately five percent of the common stock of MATC. In
addition to the ownership position, we may receive certain milestone payments and royalties as well
as share in certain payments if MATC sublicenses the technology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Pre-clinical work to date by MATC indicates that our BioLook nanotechnology performs well as a
facial line filler and may be at least as long lasting and safe as other injectable fillers.
Preliminary results indicate long lasting effects with no adverse events. BioLook should be
extremely user friendly with minimal risk of side effects and may improve both facial wrinkles and
fulfill larger facial volume needs. Further pre-clinical tests currently are underway to confirm
these preliminary positive results and determine whether BioLook can extend the beneficial
wrinkle-filling effects longer than those produced
by the leading hyaluronic acid fillers, such as Restylane currently marketed by Medicis
Pharmaceutical Corporation, which typically last about six months after injection into the skin.
Human clinical testing of BioLook for this use is being planned and is expected to be initiated by
MATC within the next six months.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; margin-left: .25in; width: 7.20in">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Vaccine Adjuvant and Delivery System</I></B>. We believe that our CaP nanoparticles may offer a means of
preparing new improved formulations of current vaccines that are equal or better in their safety
and immunogenicity, that is, in their capacity to elicit an immune response, compared to
alum-formulated and non-adjuvanted vaccines but may be injected in lower concentrations and less
often which could result in certain benefits, including cost savings and improved patient
compliance. Also, we believe that CaP will allow for creation of safe and effective vaccines for
diseases and conditions for which new vaccine alternatives may be preferred. Further, we believe
that CaP will allow for vaccines to be delivered by alternate routes of administration such as
intranasally rather than by injection.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our nanoparticles when combined with vaccine antigens have been shown in animal studies conducted
by us and others to possess an ability to elicit a higher immune response than non-adjuvanted
vaccines and an immune response of the same magnitude as alum-formulated vaccines. These
preclinical studies also have shown that our CaP nanoparticles also may sustain higher antibody
levels over a longer time period than both alum-formulated vaccines and non-adjuvanted vaccines.
Because our CaP nanoparticles are made of calcium phosphate-like material, which has a chemical
nature similar to normal bone material and therefore is natural to the human body, as opposed to
aluminum hydroxide, or alum, which is not natural to the human body, we believe that our
nanoparticles may be safer to use than alum especially for intranasal delivery. In our animal
studies, we observed no material adverse reactions when our CaP nanoparticles were administered at
effective levels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We filed an investigational new drug, or IND, application with the FDA and have conducted a Phase I
human clinical trial of CaP as a vaccine adjuvant and delivery system, which we call BioVant. As
discussed in more detail under the heading &#147;Government Regulation,&#148; the purpose of a Phase I trial
is to evaluate the metabolism and safety of the experimental product in humans, the side effects
associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of possible
effectiveness. The Phase I trial of our CaP specifically looked at safety parameters, including
local irritation and blood chemistry changes. The Phase I trial was a double blind, placebo
controlled trial, in 18 subjects to determine the safety of CaP as a vaccine adjuvant. The trial
results showed that there was no apparent difference in side-effect profile between CaP and
placebo. Phase I and or Phase II clinical trials will need to be repeated for each CaP/vaccine and
CaP/protein drug developed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In January&nbsp;2007, we announced positive results of a dose ranging pre-clinical study demonstrating
that our CaP-based vaccine adjuvant, BioVant, may serve as a vaccine adjuvant for the development
of an effective vaccine against H5N1, widely known as bird flu. Our pre-clinical study&#146;s objective
was to determine the optimal formulation of BioVant with a very low dose of H5N1 antigen. At the
start of the 16-week pre-clinical trial, mice received either the H5N1 antigen alone or in one of
several formulations with BioVant, as well as various control groups. A booster immunization was
administered after two and 10&nbsp;weeks. Results showed that the administration of a BioVant/H5N1
formulation stimulated a significantly higher production of titers of H5N1-specific antibodies than
H5N1 alone. Further, the anti-bird flu antibody levels continued to increase over the entire study
period, suggesting good duration of immunity. We believe this dose ranging study confirms the
potential of BioVant to be used as part of a dose sparing, easier to administer, non-injected
vaccine.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2007, the FDA approved a bird flu vaccine developed by Sanofi-Aventis comprised of 90 micrograms
of H5N1 antigen per dose. Our BioVant vaccine candidate uses 3 micrograms of H5N1 antigen per dose
thereby providing a possible way to avoid vaccine shortages.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Drug Delivery Systems</I></B>. The third field of use in which we are exploring applying our CaP
technology involves creating novel and improved forms of delivery of drugs, especially proteins
(e.g., insulin). The attachment of drugs to CaP may enhance their effects in the body or enable
the addition of further protective coatings to permit oral, delayed-release and mucosal (through
mucous membranes) applications. Currently, insulin is given by frequent, inconvenient and often
painful injections. However, several companies are in the process of developing and testing
products that will deliver insulin orally or through inhalation. We have shown pre-clinical
efficacy in the oral delivery of insulin in normal and diabetic mouse models. In the oral insulin
mouse models in fasted mice, our proposed product, which we call BioOral, has shown an 80&nbsp;percent
reduction of glucose levels within the first hour of treatment. These reduced glucose levels were
maintained for 12 hours versus 20-25&nbsp;percent glucose reduction for three hours for free insulin.
In fed mouse models, our oral formulation reduced glucose levels by 50&nbsp;percent for six hours versus
no significant reduction with free insulin.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Furthermore, we believe we may have created successfully a formulation for the inhaled delivery of
insulin, which we call BioAir. We also have conducted preclinical studies of our BioAir delivery
system for inhalable insulin. The studies showed that BioAir significantly increased the systemic
residence time and duration of action of the insulin, increasing the amount of insulin that became
available through the bloodstream (bioavailability)&nbsp;1.8 times over that of injected insulin. The
results indicate that our CaP technology may extend the duration of action many times over that of
injecting insulin alone, which could allow diabetics to substantially reduce the number of
injections needed to control blood glucose levels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our research and development efforts in these areas are ongoing, testing insulin and other drugs
that must now be given by injection. We also are developing a buccal formulation for protein
delivery since buccal administration results in significantly higher bioavailability of proteins
and may be better suited to proteins than oral delivery. The discontinuation of the marketing by
Pfizer of Exubera, an inhaled insulin, points to the need for longer acting, lower dose inhaled
proteins.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>License and Development Activities</I></B>. In addition to continuing our own research and development in
the potential commercial applications of our CaP technology, we have sought and continue to seek
opportunities to enter into business collaborations or joint ventures with vaccine companies and
others interested in development and marketing arrangements with respect to our CaP technology. We
believe these collaborations may enable us to accelerate the development of potential improved
vaccines and the delivery of injectable drugs by other routes of administration, such as orally,
buccally, intranasally or through needle-free administration.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our out-licensing activities with respect to our CaP vaccine adjuvant and delivery system for use
in other companies&#146; vaccines, have to date included meeting with target sub-licensees and, in some
cases, agreeing that the target sub-licensee will test our CaP adjuvant or delivery system in their
animal models. Thereafter, the target sub-licensee may send to us its vaccine antigen or DNA that
we will then formulate with our nanoparticles and return for use in the target sub-licensee&#146;s
animal models. Once this is completed, if the results are positive, we would seek to negotiate an
out-license agreement with the target sub-licensee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2005, we signed a Material Transfer and Option Agreement for an exclusive option to
obtain an exclusive, worldwide license to use our CaP in the development of a series of allergy
products. The partner company will fund its development of potential products for the treatment of
conditions including rhinitis, asthma, conjunctivitis, dermatitis, and allergic gastrointestinal
diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, we received a nonrefundable $250,000 upfront payment.
If the option is exercised and the parties enter into an exclusive license agreement, we will
receive a one-time license fee, annual maintenance payments, milestone payments upon the
achievement of regulatory milestones and royalties on commercial sales of any allergy product that
is developed using CaP.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2005, we were awarded a subcontract by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for the
development of recombinant Factor IX formulations for delivery via alternative routes of

year $10.0&nbsp;million grant entitled &#147;GMP Recombinant FIX for IV and Oral Hemophilia B Therapy&#148; from

alternative routes of drug administration, specifically buccal and pulmonary administration using
our proprietary CaP BioOral and BioAir technologies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">It is important to point out that vaccine development is an expensive and long-term process. We
have used our strategy of utilizing primarily outside resources to fund CaP&#146;s development in order
to leverage the expertise of other companies and the United States government and to minimize our
spending on this expensive and long-term development work. Our strategic plan is to focus on our

million in 2006 on research and development activities. We spent an average of approximately
$400,000 per month on our research and development activities during 2007. We expect our research

result of the initiation of our LibiGel Phase III clinical trial program. We expect our research
and development expenses to remain at the average 2007 levels until late in the first half of 2008,
when we expect them to increase to at least $800,000 to $1.0&nbsp;million per month. The amount of our

July&nbsp;2005, we exercised the option for an exclusive license for the three U.S. patents for triple
hormone contraception. The financial terms of this license include an upfront payment, regulatory
milestone payments, maintenance payments and royalty payments by us if a product incorporating the
licensed technology gets approved and subsequently marketed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In May&nbsp;2007, we announced that we sub-licensed the U.S. rights to a new triple hormone oral
contraceptive to Pantarhei Bioscience B.V. (Pantarhei), a Netherlands-based pharmaceutical company.
Pantarhei is responsible under the agreement for all expenses to develop and market the product.
We may receive certain development and regulatory milestones for the first product developed under
the license. In addition, we will receive royalty payments on any sales of the product in the
U.S., if and when approved and marketed. If the product is sublicensed by Pantarhei to another
company, we will receive a percentage of any and all payments received by Pantarhei for the
sublicense from a third party. We have retained all rights under our licensed patents to the
transdermal delivery of triple hormone contraceptives.

University of California, which has subsequently been amended, pursuant to which the University has
granted us an exclusive license to certain United States patents owned by the University, including
rights to sublicense such patents, in fields of use pertaining to vaccine adjuvants and drug
delivery systems. The expiration dates of these patents range from 2010 to 2014. In addition, we
own several patents and patent applications covering the technology expiring beginning in 2021.
The University of California also has filed patent applications for this licensed technology in
several foreign jurisdictions, including Canada, Europe and Japan. The license agreement requires
us to undertake various obligations, including the payment of royalties to the University based on
a percentage of the net sales of any products we sell or a licensee sells incorporating the
licensed technology and the payment of the costs of patent prosecution and maintenance of the
patents included in the agreement, which amounted to $0 and $8,236 in 2007 and 2006, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2005, we signed a Material Transfer and Option Agreement for an exclusive option to
obtain an exclusive, worldwide license to use our CaP in the development of a series of allergy
products. The partner company will fund its development of potential products for the treatment of
conditions including rhinitis, asthma, conjunctivitis, dermatitis, and allergic gastrointestinal
diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, in September&nbsp;2005, we received a nonrefundable
$250,000 upfront payment. If the option is exercised and the parties enter into an exclusive
license agreement, we will receive a one-
time license fee, annual maintenance payments, milestone payments upon the achievement of
regulatory milestones and royalties on commercial sales of any allergy product that is developed
using CaP.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">There is intense competition in the biopharmaceutical industry, including in the hormone therapy
market, the market for prevention and/or treatment of the same infectious diseases we target and in
the acquisition of new products. Potential competitors in the United States are numerous and
include major pharmaceutical and specialized biotechnology companies, universities and other
institutions. In general, competition in the pharmaceutical industry can be divided into four
categories: (1)&nbsp;corporations with large research and developmental departments that develop and
market products in many therapeutic areas; (2)&nbsp;companies that have moderate research and
development capabilities and focus their product strategy on a small number of therapeutic areas;
(3)&nbsp;small companies with limited development capabilities and only a few product offerings; and
(4)&nbsp;university and other research institutions. All of our competitors in categories (1)&nbsp;and (2)
and some of our competitors in category (3)&nbsp;have longer operating histories, greater name
recognition, substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs
than we do, as well as substantially greater experience than us in developing products, obtaining
regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. A significant
amount of research in the field is being carried out at academic and government institutions.
These institutions are becoming increasingly aware of the commercial value of their findings and
are becoming more aggressive in pursuing patent protection and negotiating licensing arrangements
to collect royalties for use of technology that they have developed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">There are several firms currently marketing or developing hormone therapy products similar to ours.
They include Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc., Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Wyeth, Auxilium
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ascend Therapeutics, Inc., Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Solvay
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Competitor hormone therapy products include oral tablets, transdermal
patches and gels. We expect our FDA-approved product, Elestrin, and our other hormone therapy
products, if and when approved for sale, to compete primarily on the basis of product efficacy,
safety, patient convenience, reliability and patent position. In addition, the first product to
reach the market in a therapeutic or preventative area is often at a significant competitive
advantage relative to later entrants in the market and may result in certain marketing exclusivity
as per federal legislation. Acceptance by physicians and other health care providers, including
managed care groups, is also critical to the success of a product versus competitor products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">With regard to our CaP technology, the international vaccine industry is dominated by three
companies: GlaxoSmithKline plc, Sanofi-aventis (through its subsidiaries, including Institut
Merieux International S.A., Pasteur Merieux Serums et Vaccins, S.A., Connaught Laboratories Limited
and Connaught Laboratories, Inc.) and Merck &#038; Co., Inc. The larger, better known pharmaceutical
companies have generally focused on a traditional synthetic drug approach, although some have
substantial expertise in biotechnology. During the last decade, however, significant research
activity in the biotechnology industry has been completed by smaller research and development
companies, like us, formed to pursue new technologies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Pre-Clinical Studies and Clinical Trials. </I></B>Typically, preclinical studies are conducted in the
laboratory and in animals to gain preliminary information on a proposed product&#146;s uses and
physiological effects and harmful effects, if any, and to identify any potential safety problems
that would preclude testing in humans. The results of these studies, together with the general
investigative plan, protocols for specific human studies and other information, are submitted to
the FDA as part of the IND application. The FDA regulations do not, by their terms, require FDA
approval of an IND. Rather, they allow a clinical investigation to commence if the FDA does not
notify the sponsor to the contrary within 30&nbsp;days of receipt of the IND. As a practical matter,
however, FDA approval is often sought before a company commences clinical investigations. That
approval may come within 30&nbsp;days of IND receipt but may involve substantial delays if the FDA
requests additional information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our submission of an IND, or those of our collaboration partners, may not result in FDA
authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be
made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Depending on its
significance, the FDA also must approve changes to an existing IND. Further, an independent
institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial
must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it
must monitor the study until completed. Alternatively, a central IRB may be used instead of
individual IRBs. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor
may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects
or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy
extensive Good Clinical Practice requirements and regulations for informed consent.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The sponsor of a drug product typically conducts human clinical trials in three sequential phases,
but the phases may overlap or not all phases may be necessary. The initial phase of clinical
testing, which is known as Phase I, is conducted to evaluate the metabolism, uses and physiological
effects of the experimental product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses,
and, if possible, to gain early evidence of possible effectiveness. Phase I studies can also
evaluate various routes, dosages and schedules of product administration. These studies generally
involve a small number of healthy volunteer subjects, but may be conducted in people with the
disease the product is intended to treat. The total number of subjects is generally in the range
of 20 to 80. A demonstration of therapeutic benefit is not required in order to complete Phase I
trials successfully. If acceptable product safety is demonstrated, Phase II trials may be
initiated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Phase II trials are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the product in the treatment of a
given disease and involve people with the disease under study. These trials often are well
controlled, closely monitored studies involving a relatively small number of subjects, usually no
more than several hundred. The optimal routes, dosages and schedules of administration are
determined in these studies. If Phase II trials are completed successfully, Phase III trials are
often commenced, although Phase III trials are not always required.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Phase III trials are expanded, controlled trials that are performed after preliminary evidence of
the effectiveness of the experimental product has been obtained. These trials are intended to
gather the additional information about safety and effectiveness that is needed to evaluate the
overall risk/benefit relationship of the experimental product and provide the substantial evidence
of effectiveness and the evidence of safety necessary for product approval. Phase III trials are
usually conducted with several hundred to several thousand subjects.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and typically two or more Phase
III studies are required. A company&#146;s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular
phase is not necessarily indicative that the trial will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA
requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data
have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. In addition, a clinical trial may contain elements
of more than one phase notwithstanding the designation of the trial as being of a particular phase.
The FDA closely monitors the progress of the phases of clinical testing and may, at its
discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated and
its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to patients. It is not possible to estimate with any
certainty the time required to complete Phase I, II and III studies with respect to a given
product.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>New Drug Applications. </I></B>Upon the successful completion of clinical testing, an NDA is submitted to
the FDA for approval. This application requires detailed data on the results of preclinical
testing, clinical testing and the composition of the product, specimen labeling to be used with the
drug, information on manufacturing methods and samples of the product. The FDA reviews all NDAs
submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than
accepting an NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth
review of the NDA. Under the policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee
Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has 10&nbsp;months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and
respond to the applicant. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three
months if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or
clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months
of the PDUFA goal date. The FDA typically takes
from 10 to 18&nbsp;months to review an NDA after it has been accepted for filing. Following its review
of an NDA, the FDA invariably raises questions or requests additional information. The NDA
approval process can, accordingly, be very lengthy. Further, there is no assurance that the FDA
will ultimately approve an NDA.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During its review of an NDA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review,
evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA may refuse
to approve an NDA and issue a not approvable letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not
satisfied, or it may require additional clinical or other data, including one or more additional
pivotal Phase III clinical trials. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide
that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always
conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaboration partners
interpret data. If the FDA&#146;s evaluations of the NDA and the clinical and manufacturing procedures
and facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue either an approval letter or an approvable letter,
which contains the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. If and
when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval
letter, authorizing commercial marketing of the drug for certain indications. The FDA may withdraw
drug approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the
drug reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical
trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been
commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on
the results of these post-marketing programs. Drugs may be marketed only for the FDA-approved
indications and in accordance with the FDA-approved label. Further, if there are any modifications
to the drug, including changes in indications, other labeling changes, or manufacturing processes
or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement,
which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and
clinical trials.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Special Protocol Assessments</I></B>. The special protocol assessment, or SPA, process generally involves
FDA evaluation of a proposed Phase III clinical trial protocol and a commitment from the FDA that
the design and analysis of the trial are adequate to support approval of an NDA, if the trial is
performed according to the SPA and meets its endpoints. The FDA&#146;s guidance on the SPA process
indicates that SPAs are designed to evaluate individual clinical trial protocols primarily in
response to specific questions posed by the sponsors. In practice, the sponsor of a product
candidate may request an SPA for proposed Phase III trial objectives, designs, clinical endpoints
and analyses. A request for an SPA is submitted in the form of a separate amendment to an IND, and
the FDA&#146;s evaluation generally will be completed within a 45-day review period under applicable
PDUFA goals, provided that the trials have been the subject of discussion at an end-of-Phase II and
pre-Phase III meeting with the FDA, or in other limited cases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">If an agreement is reached, the FDA will reduce the agreement to writing and make it part of the
administrative record. While the FDA&#146;s guidance on SPAs states that documented SPAs should be
considered binding on the review division, the FDA has the latitude to change its assessment if
certain exceptions apply. Exceptions include identification of a substantial scientific issue
essential to safety or efficacy testing that later comes to light, a sponsor&#146;s failure to follow
the protocol agreed upon, or the FDA&#146;s reliance on data, assumptions or information that are
determined to be wrong.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In January&nbsp;2008, we announced that we successfully completed and reached agreement with the FDA

approval requirements similar to those in the United States, although the requirements governing
the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from
country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate
application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval
process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that
required for FDA approval. In certain European countries, the sales price of a product must also
be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. We intend
to seek and utilize foreign partners to apply for foreign approvals of our products.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have a history of operating losses. We incurred a net loss of $7.6&nbsp;million for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007 and as of December&nbsp;31, 2007, our accumulated deficit was $54.5&nbsp;million. All of
our revenue to date has been derived from upfront and milestone payments earned on licensing and
sub-licensing transactions, revenue earned from subcontracts with various parties and royalty
revenue generated by our marketing licensee, Nycomed, who commercially launched Elestrin in June
2007. We expect to incur substantial and continuing losses for the foreseeable future as our own
product development programs expand and various preclinical and clinical trials commence or
continue, including in particular our Phase III clinical trial program for LibiGel. The amount of
these losses may vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter and will depend on,

raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations. We believe that our cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments of $30.7&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2007 will be sufficient to
meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next
18&nbsp;months, and if we are unable to liquidate our auction rate securities, through at least the next
12&nbsp;months. However, we may resort to seeking additional financing prior to that time. As an
alternative to raising additional financing, we may be able to license LibiGel to a third party who
would finance the continued development and if approved, commercialization of LibiGel. Our future
capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including:

regulatory approval than we expect or may never gain approval. If regulatory approval is delayed
or never obtained, our management&#146;s credibility, the value of our company and our operating results
and liquidity would be adversely affected. Furthermore, even if a product gains regulatory
approval, the product and the manufacturer of the product may be subject to continuing regulatory
review. Even after obtaining regulatory approval, we may be restricted or prohibited from
marketing or manufacturing a product if previously unknown problems with the product or its
manufacture are subsequently discovered. The FDA may also require us to commit to perform lengthy
post-approval studies, for which we would have to expend significant additional resources, which
could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">To obtain regulatory approval to market our products, costly and lengthy pre-clinical studies and
human clinical trials are required, and the results of the studies and trials are highly uncertain.
As part of the
FDA approval process, we must conduct, at our own expense or the expense of current or potential
licensees, clinical trials on humans on each of our proposed products. Pre-clinical studies on
animals must be conducted on some of our proposed products. We expect the number of pre-clinical
studies and human clinical trials that the FDA will require will vary depending on the product, the
disease or condition the product is being developed to address and regulations applicable to the
particular product. We may need to perform multiple pre-clinical studies using various doses and
formulations before we can begin human clinical trials, which could result in delays in our ability
to market any of our products. Furthermore, even if we obtain favorable results in pre-clinical
studies on animals, the results in humans may be different.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">After we have conducted pre-clinical studies in animals, we must demonstrate that our products are
safe and effective for use on the target human patients in order to receive regulatory approval for
commercial sale. The data obtained from pre-clinical and human clinical testing are subject to
varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We face the risk
that the results of our clinical trials in later phases of clinical trials may be inconsistent with
those obtained in earlier phases. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have
suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after experiencing promising
results in early animal or human testing. Adverse or inconclusive human clinical results would
prevent us from filing for regulatory approval of our products. Additional factors that can cause
delay or termination of our human clinical trials include:

of certain forms of hormone therapy could adversely affect the market for hormone therapy products
and the trading price of our common stock.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The market for hormone therapy products has been affected negatively by the Women&#146;s Health
Initiative study and other studies that have found that the overall health risks from the use of
certain hormone therapy products exceed the benefits from the use of those products among healthy
postmenopausal women. In July&nbsp;2002, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)&nbsp;released data from its
Women&#146;s Health Initiative (WHI)&nbsp;study on the risks and benefits associated with long-term use of
oral hormone therapy by healthy women. The NIH announced that it was discontinuing the arm of the
study investigating the use of oral estrogen/progestin combination hormone therapy products after
an average follow-up period of 5.2&nbsp;years because the product used in the study was shown to cause
an increase in the risk of invasive breast cancer. The study also found an increased risk of
stroke, heart attacks and blood clots and concluded that overall health risks exceeded benefits
from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average of 5.2&nbsp;year follow-up among healthy
postmenopausal women. Also in July&nbsp;2002, results of an observational study sponsored by the
National Cancer Institute on the effects of estrogen therapy were announced. The main finding of
the study was that postmenopausal women who used estrogen therapy for 10 or more years had a higher
risk of developing ovarian cancer than women who never used hormone therapy. In October&nbsp;2002, a
significant hormone therapy study being conducted in the United Kingdom was also halted. Our
hormone therapy products differ from the products used in the Women&#146;s Health Initiative study and
the primary products observed in the National Cancer Institute and United Kingdom studies. In
March&nbsp;2004, the NIH announced that the estrogen-alone study was discontinued after nearly seven
years because the NIH concluded that estrogen alone does not affect (either increase or decrease)
heart disease, the major question being evaluated in the study. The findings indicated a slightly
increased risk of stroke as well as a decreased risk of hip fracture and breast cancer.
Preliminary data from the memory portion of the WHI study suggested that estrogen alone may
possibly be associated with a slight increase in the risk of dementia or mild cognitive impairment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Researchers continue to analyze data from both arms of the WHI study and other studies. Recent
reports indicate that the safety of estrogen products may be affected by the age of the woman at
initiation of therapy. There currently are no studies published comparing the safety of our
hormone therapy products against other hormone therapies. The markets for female hormone therapies
for menopausal symptoms
have declined as a result of these published studies. The release of any follow-up or other
studies that show adverse affects from hormone therapy, including in particular, hormone therapies
similar to our products, would also adversely affect our business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In November&nbsp;2006, we entered into an exclusive sublicense agreement with Bradley Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. for the marketing of Elestrin in the United States pursuant to which we received an upfront
license payment, certain regulatory milestone payments and have the right to receive certain
sales-based milestone payments, plus royalties on sales of Elestrin. As a result of this
agreement, Elestrin is subject to not only general market acceptance of the product, but also the
success of Bradley in marketing and selling the product. Bradley commercially launched Elestrin in
June&nbsp;2007. We recognized $69,353 in royalty revenue from the sales of Elestrin during the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 which represents the gross royalty revenue received from Bradley and not
our corresponding obligation to pay Antares a portion of the royalties received. We, therefore,
have not received any meaningful royalty revenue from the sale of Elestrin and we do not know when
if ever, Bradley&#146;s Elestrin sales will result in significant royalty revenue to us. Effective
February&nbsp;21, 2008, Nycomed US Inc. completed its acquisition of Bradley. As a result, all
references to Bradley have been changed to Nycomed in this report. Although we have no reason to
believe that the acquisition of Bradley will adversely affect its desire to continue to be our
exclusive sublicensee for Elestrin or adversely affect Nycomed&#146;s future sales of Elestrin, no
assurance can be provided that the acquisition will not have such an adverse effect. We cannot
assure you that Nycomed will remain focused on the commercialization of Elestrin or will not
otherwise breach the terms of our agreement, especially if Nycomed&#146;s Elestrin sales do not increase
significantly. Any breach by Nycomed of its obligations under our agreement or a termination of
the agreement could adversely affect the success of Elestrin if we are unable to sublicense the
product to another party on substantially the same or better terms or continue the future
commercialization of the product ourselves.

California&#146;s license agreement within 60&nbsp;days after written notice from the University of
California, the other party to these agreements may terminate these agreements or certain projects
contained in these agreements. The termination of these agreements, however, will not relieve us
of our obligation to pay any royalty or license fees owed at the time of termination. Our failure
to retain the right to license the technology underlying our proposed hormone therapy products or
CaP technology could harm our business and future operating results. For example, if we were to
enter into an sublicense agreement with a third party under which we agree to sublicense our
hormone therapy technology or CaP technology for a license fee, the termination of the main license
agreement with Antares Pharma, Inc. or the University of California could either, depending upon
the terms of the sublicense agreement, cause us to breach our obligations under the sublicense

on the development and commercialization of our partnered products or will not otherwise breach the
terms of our agreements with them, especially since these third parties may also compete with us
with respect to some of our proposed products. For example, at this time, we believe that our
estrogen/progestogen combination transdermal hormone therapy gel product licensed to Solvay is not
in active development by Solvay, and we do not expect its active development to occur at any time
in the near future. As an additional example, in 2005, we were notified that Teva USA had
discontinued development of our male testosterone gel, Bio-T-Gel, product and indicated to us a
desire to formally terminate the agreement. Although in June&nbsp;2007, we signed an amendment to the
agreement under which we and Teva reinitiated our collaboration on the development of Bio-T-Gel for
the U.S. market and Teva withdrew its previous notice of its desire to terminate the agreement and

partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA&#146;s review of NDAs,
enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Under certain circumstances, the FDA

settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be
substantial and often require the payment of ongoing royalties, which could hurt our gross margins.
In addition, we cannot be sure that the necessary licenses would be available to us on
satisfactory terms, or that we could redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement, if
necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or
the failure to obtain necessary licenses, could prevent us from developing, manufacturing and

arrangements in place with both of our two executive officers, but neither of our executive
officers is legally bound to remain employed for any specific term. Although we have key man life
insurance on our Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen M. Simes, we do not
have key man life insurance policies covering our other executive officer or any of our other
employees. If key individuals leave BioSante, we could be adversely affected if suitable
replacement personnel are not recruited quickly.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">There is competition for qualified personnel in all functional areas, which makes it difficult to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and
adversely affect our liquidity.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2007, we had $15.0&nbsp;million in short-term investments consisting primarily of
auction rate securities. At March&nbsp;14, 2008, we had approximately $14.0&nbsp;million invested in auction
rate securities. Liquidity for our auction rate securities historically has been provided by an
auction process which has allowed us the opportunity to sell the securities at each auction date,
and for those securities not sold, resets the applicable interest rate every 28&nbsp;days. Although
auctions have been successful for periods immediately subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2007, recently
auctions for our auction rate securities have failed which therefore have eliminated our ability to
sell these securities through the standard auction process. Currently there is no liquid market
for these securities. There is no assurance that future auctions in our auction rate securities
will succeed. An auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not
be matched with an adequate volume of buyers. In the event that there is a failed auction the
indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined
rate which may or may not correspond to market rates for other types of similar short-term
instruments. Our securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the
contractual rate and be subject to the auction process every 28&nbsp;days until the auction succeeds,
the issuer redeems the securities or they mature. As a result, our ability to liquidate our
investment in these securities and use the cash proceeds to operate our business in the near term
may be limited. Our ability to fully recover the carrying value of our investment in these
securities may also be limited or non-
existent in the near term. All of our investments in auction rate securities are classified as
short-term investments in our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.
However, these recent developments may result in the classification of some or all of these
securities as long-term investments in our future financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">All of
the underlying assets of our auction rate securities are student
loans substantially all of which are backed by the federal government
under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Substantially all of our auction rate
securities are currently rated AAA, the highest rating available by a
rating agency. We currently
believe the market values of our auction rate securities are not significantly impaired, primarily due to government
agency backing of the underlying securities and the investment-grade credit rating of each auction
rate security in our portfolio. However, it could take until the final maturity or issuer
refinancing of the underlying debt for us to realize the recorded value of our investments in these
securities. If the issuers of our auction rate securities are unable to successfully close future
auctions or redeem or refinance the securities and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the
future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments, and may need to sell these
securities on a secondary market. Although we believe we will be able to liquidate our investments
in these securities without any significant loss, the timing and financial impact of such an
outcome is uncertain. Based on our expected cash expenditures, our cash and cash equivalents
balance and other potential sources of cash, including our anticipated ability to borrow using
these securities as collateral, we do not anticipate that the potential lack of liquidity of these
investments in the near term will adversely affect our ability to execute our current business
plan. However, no assurance can be provided that our ability to execute our business plan will not
be affected by this risk.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>General Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are a biopharmaceutical company that develops hormone therapy products to treat men and women.
We also are engaged in the development of our proprietary calcium phosphate nanotechnology, or CaP,
primarily for aesthetic medicine, novel vaccines and drug delivery.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Hormone Therapy Products</I></B>. Our hormone therapy products are gel formulations of testosterone,
estradiol and various combinations of testosterone and estradiol. Our key hormone therapy products
include LibiGel, Elestrin, Bio-T-Gel and The Pill-Plus (triple hormone contraceptives). We license
the technology underlying our hormone therapy products, except Bio-T-Gel and The Pill-Plus, from
Antares Pharma, Inc. Bio-T-Gel was developed and is fully-owned by us. Our license agreement with
Antares requires us to pay Antares certain development and regulatory milestone payments and
royalties based on net sales of any products we or our sub-licensees sell incorporating the
licensed technology and required us to pay an up-front license fee. We license the technology
underlying our proposed triple hormone contraceptives from Wake Forest University Health Sciences
and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The financial terms of this license include an upfront license
fee, regulatory milestone payments, maintenance payments and royalty payments by us if a product
incorporating the licensed technology gets approved and is subsequently marketed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have entered into several sublicense agreements covering our hormone therapy products, including
a development and license agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., pursuant to which Teva USA
agreed to develop our male testosterone gel, Bio-T-Gel, for the U.S. market, an agreement with
Solvay Pharmaceuticals, B.V. covering the U.S. and Canadian rights to the estrogen/progestogen
combination transdermal hormone therapy gel product and an agreement with Paladin Labs Inc.
covering Canadian rights to certain of our hormone therapy products. We believe that our
estrogen/progestogen combination transdermal hormone therapy gel product which we have sub-licensed
to Solvay is not in active development by Solvay, and we do not expect its active development to
occur at any time in the near future. The financial terms of these agreements generally include an
upfront license fee, milestone payments and royalty payments to us if a product incorporating the
licensed technology gets approved and is subsequently marketed and a portion of any payments
received from subsequent successful out-licensing efforts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In November&nbsp;2006, we entered into an exclusive sublicense agreement with Nycomed for the marketing
of Elestrin in the United States. Upon execution of the sublicense agreement, we received an
upfront payment of $3.5&nbsp;million. In addition, Nycomed paid us $10.5&nbsp;million in milestone payments
during 2007 as a result of the FDA approval of Elestrin in the U.S., which occurred in December
2006. Nycomed also has agreed to pay us additional payments of up to $40.0&nbsp;million in the event
certain sales-based milestones are achieved, plus royalties on sales of Elestrin. We license the
transdermal estradiol gel
formulation that is used in Elestrin from Antares Pharma, Inc. Under our license agreement with
Antares, we are obligated to pay Antares 25&nbsp;percent of all licensing-related milestones and a
portion of any future associated royalties. Nycomed began its commercial launch of Elestrin in
June&nbsp;2007. The Elestrin FDA approval was a non-conditional and full approval with no Phase IV
development commitments. In addition, we received three years of marketing exclusivity for
Elestrin.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">LibiGel successfully has completed a Phase II clinical trial, and we began the first of two Phase
III safety and efficacy clinical trials in December&nbsp;2006. We believe based on FDA discussions,
meetings and agreements including a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA)&nbsp;received in January&nbsp;2008 that
two Phase III safety and efficacy trials and one year of LibiGel exposure in a separate safety
study with a four year follow-up post-NDA filing and potentially post-FDA approval are the
essential requirements for submission and, if successful, approval by the FDA of an NDA for
LibiGel. Following NDA submission and potential FDA approval, we will continue to follow the
subjects in the safety study for an additional four years. The Phase III cardiovascular safety
study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, cardiovascular events driven
study of between 2,400 and 3,100 women exposed to LibiGel or placebo for 12&nbsp;months. We initiated
the safety study in January&nbsp;2008. The Phase III safety and efficacy trials of LibiGel in the
treatment of female sexual dysfunction, one of which was initiated in December&nbsp;2006 and the other
of which we intend to initiate in the first half of 2008, are double-blind, placebo-controlled
trials that will enroll up to approximately 500 surgically menopausal women each for a six-month
clinical trial.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In January&nbsp;2008, we announced that we successfully completed and reached agreement with the FDA
under the Special Protocol Assessment process for our Phase III safety and efficacy clinical trials
for LibiGel in the treatment of FSD, specifically, hypoactive sexual desire disorder. The SPA
process and agreement affirms that the FDA agrees that the LibiGel Phase III clinical trial design,
clinical endpoints, sample size, planned conduct and statistical analyses are acceptable to support
regulatory approval. Further, it provides assurance that these agreed measures will serve as the
basis for regulatory review and the decision by the FDA to approve an NDA for LibiGel. The SPA
agreement covers the pivotal Phase III safety and efficacy trials of LibiGel<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"> </SUP>in the
treatment of FSD. These SPA trials use our validated instruments to measure the clinical endpoints.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In May&nbsp;2007, we announced that we sub-licensed U.S. rights to a new triple hormone oral
contraceptive to Pantarhei Bioscience B.V., a Netherlands-based pharmaceutical company. Pantarhei
is responsible under the agreement for all expenses to develop and market the product. We may
receive certain development and regulatory milestones for the first product developed under the
license. In addition, we will receive royalty payments on any sales of the product in the U.S., if
and when approved and marketed. If the product is sublicensed by Pantarhei to another company, we
will receive a percentage of any and all payments received by Pantarhei for the sublicense from a
third party.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>CaP Technology and Proposed Products</I></B>. Our strategy with respect to our CaP technology is to
continue development of our nanoparticle technology and actively seek collaborators and licensees
to fund and accelerate the development and commercialization of products incorporating the
technology. In addition to continuing our own product development in the potential commercial
applications of our CaP technology, we have sought and continue to seek opportunities to enter into
business collaborations or joint ventures with vaccine companies and others interested in
development and marketing arrangements with respect to our CaP technology.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">For example, in September&nbsp;2005, we signed a Material Transfer and Option Agreement for an exclusive
option to obtain an exclusive, worldwide license to use our CaP in the development of a series of
allergy products. Under the agreement, we received a nonrefundable $250,000 upfront payment. We
are recognizing revenue from this agreement on a pro rata basis over the term of the agreement.
The
remainder of the upfront payment is recorded as deferred revenue. If the option is exercised and
the parties enter into an exclusive license agreement, we will receive a one-time license fee,
annual maintenance payments, milestone payments upon the achievement of regulatory milestones and
royalties on commercial sales of any allergy product that is developed using CaP. We recorded
licensing revenue of $59,091 and $136,364 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to this contract.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In February&nbsp;2006, we signed an exclusive option and license agreement with Medical Aesthetics
Technology Corporation (MATC)&nbsp;for the use of our CaP technology in the field of aesthetic medicine.
In November&nbsp;2007, we signed a license agreement with MATC covering the use of our CaP as a facial
filler in aesthetic medicine. Under the license agreement, MATC is responsible for continued
development of BioLook, including required clinical trials, regulatory filings and all
manufacturing and marketing associated with the product. In exchange for the license, we received
an ownership position in MATC of approximately five percent of the common stock of MATC. In
addition to the ownership position, we may receive certain milestone payments and royalties as well
as share in certain payments if MATC sublicenses the technology. We recorded licensing revenue of
$140,000 related to this license and ownership position in MATC.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under a subcontract with DynPort Vaccine Company LLC, we provided BioVant, our vaccine adjuvant,
and DynPort provided recombinant antigens to be used in potential vaccines against anthrax. The
objective was to assess the immunogenic potential of BioVant when used in anthrax vaccines versus
the immunogenic response of anthrax vaccines that use alum as the vaccine adjuvant. We completed
the subcontract and recorded approximately $300,000 in revenue over the life of the subcontract
with $1,806 and $82,985 recognized in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Currently, we are seeking
additional funding from government sources or potential partners for our anthrax program.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">All of our revenue to date has been derived from upfront, milestone and royalty payments earned on
licensing and sublicensing transactions and from subcontracts. We have not commercially introduced
any products and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. However, Nycomed, our marketing
sublicensee for Elestrin, launched Elestrin in June&nbsp;2007. As a result, commencing in mid-2007, we
began to receive royalties on net sales of Elestrin. However, such royalties were minimal during
2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">To date, we have used primarily equity financing, licensing income and interest income to fund our
ongoing business operations and short-term liquidity needs, and we expect to continue this practice
for the foreseeable future. In 2006, upon execution of the sublicense agreement with Nycomed, we
received an upfront payment of $3.5&nbsp;million. In addition, Nycomed paid us $7.0&nbsp;million and $3.5
million in the first and fourth quarters 2007, respectively, both triggered by the FDA approval of
Elestrin in the U.S., which occurred in the fourth quarter 2006. Under our license agreement with
Antares, we are obligated to pay Antares 25&nbsp;percent of all licensing-related milestones and a
portion of any future associated royalties. The aggregate $14.0&nbsp;million received from Nycomed
(consisting of the following amounts paid by Nycomed to us: $3.5&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter
2006, $7.0&nbsp;million in the first quarter 2007 and $3.5&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter 2007) was
recognized as revenue in 2006 since the entire $14.0&nbsp;million was non-refundable, we had a
contractual right to receive such payments, the contract price was fixed, the collection of the
resulting receivable was reasonably assured and we had no further performance obligations under the
license agreement. The corresponding obligations to Antares were represented as &#147;Due to Licensor
&#151; Antares&#148; on our balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2006 and expensed as &#147;Licensing expense&#148; on our
statement of operations for 2006. Nycomed also has agreed to pay us additional payments of up to
$40.0&nbsp;million in the event certain sales-based milestones are achieved, plus royalties on sales of
Elestrin. We are obligated to pay 25&nbsp;percent of any sales-based milestone payments and a
specified portion of royalties to Antares, which we will recognize as these payments are triggered,
based on reported levels of future Elestrin sales.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Nycomed commercially launched Elestrin in June&nbsp;2007. As such, we recognized royalty revenue of
$69,353 based upon Nycomed&#146;s net sales of Elestrin during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. The
royalty revenue presented in our statements of operations represents the gross royalty revenue to
be received from Nycomed. Our corresponding obligation to pay Antares a portion of the royalties
received was $31,209 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. While we believe that royalty revenues from Nycomed may be significant in the long term,
actual sales-based royalty revenue related to Elestrin was not significant for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007, and we do not know when, if ever, Nycomed&#146;s Elestrin sales will result in
significant royalty revenue to us.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In June&nbsp;2007, we completed a private placement of 3,054,999 shares of our common stock and
associated warrants to purchase 763,750 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $6.00 per
share. The private placement resulted in net proceeds of approximately $17.3&nbsp;million, after
deduction of transaction expenses. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were
$30.7&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our business operations to date have consisted mostly of licensing and research and development
activities and we expect this to continue for the immediate future. If and when our proposed
products for which we have not entered into marketing relationships receive FDA approval, we may
begin to incur other expenses, including sales and marketing related expenses if we choose to
market the products ourselves. We currently do not have sufficient resources on a long-term basis
to complete the commercialization of any of our proposed products for which we have not entered
into marketing relationships. Based on our current cash resources and our current commitments, we
believe we should be able to maintain our current planned development activities and the
corresponding level of expenditures through at least the next 18&nbsp;months, and if we are unable to
liquidate our auction rate securities, through at least the next 12&nbsp;months (See &#147;&#151;Liquidity and
Capital Resources<B>&#148; </B>section). No assurance can be provided that we will not need or seek
additional cash prior to such time. As an alternative to raising additional financing, we may
license LibiGel or another product to a third party who may finance a portion or all of the
continued development and if approved, commercialization of LibiGel or the other product, or we may
elect to sell certain assets or rights we have under our existing license agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We spent an average of approximately $400,000 per month on research and development activities in
2007. Our research and development expenses increased $843,023 or 22&nbsp;percent, to $4.8&nbsp;million for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 from $3.9&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, primarily
as a result of the initiation of our Phase III clinical development program for LibiGel, which
began in December&nbsp;2006. We expect our monthly research and development expenses to remain at the
average monthly 2007 levels until late in the first half of 2008, when we expect such monthly
expenses to increase to at least $800,000 to $1.0&nbsp;million per month. The amount of our actual
research and development expenditures may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year
depending upon: (1)&nbsp;our development schedule, including the timing of our clinical trials; (2)
resources available; (3)&nbsp;results of studies, clinical trials and regulatory decisions; (4)&nbsp;whether
we or our licensees are funding the development of our proposed products; and (5)&nbsp;competitive
developments.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our general and administrative expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 decreased $218,259 or
five percent, compared to general and administrative expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006.
This decrease was due primarily to a decrease in business development costs and a decrease in
non-cash, stock-based compensation expense partially offset by an increase in other
personnel-related costs. Our non-cash, stock-based compensation expense for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007 decreased $365,573,
or 34&nbsp;percent, compared to non-cash, stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December
31, 2006. The primary reason for this decrease was $746,616 of expense that was recorded in 2006
related to the March&nbsp;2006 grant of stock options to our non-employee directors, which options were
immediately exercisable and as a result were fully expensed on the grant date. Our general and
administrative expenses may fluctuate from year-to-year depending upon the amount of non-cash,
stock-based compensation expense, legal, public and investor relations, accounting and corporate
governance and other fees and expenses incurred.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We recognized a net loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 of $7.6&nbsp;million. We recognized net
income of $2.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 primarily due to the recognition of
$14.0&nbsp;million in licensing revenue as a result of the execution of our sublicense agreement with
Nycomed and the subsequent FDA approval of Elestrin in the fourth quarter of 2006. Although we
expect to continue to receive royalty income and possibly sales-based milestone payments from
Nycomed, we expect to incur substantial and continuing losses for the foreseeable future. This is
true especially as our own product development programs expand and various preclinical and clinical
trials commence or continue, including in particular the Phase III clinical trial program for
LibiGel and other trials and studies associated with LibiGel. The amount of these losses may vary
significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter and will depend on, among other factors:

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our financial statements included in
Item&nbsp;8 of this report. The discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of
operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these
financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. The SEC has defined a company&#146;s critical accounting policies as those that are
most important to the portrayal of its financial
condition and results of operations, and which the company is required to make its most difficult
and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are
inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the following critical
accounting policies. Although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they
are based upon information available when they are made. Actual results may differ significantly
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We enter into various licensing agreements that generate license revenue or other upfront fees and
which may also involve subsequent milestone payments earned upon our completion of development
milestones or upon the occurrence of certain regulatory actions, such as the filing of a regulatory
application or the receipt of a regulatory approval. We recognize non-refundable license fees as
revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment, the contract price is fixed or
determinable, the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no
further performance obligations under the license agreement. Non-refundable license fees that meet
these criteria and are due to us upon execution of an agreement are recognized as revenue
immediately.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Milestones, in the form of additional license fees, typically represent non-refundable payments to
be received in conjunction with the achievement of a specific event identified in the contract,
such as completion of specified clinical development activities and/or regulatory submissions
and/or approvals. We recognize revenues from milestone payments that meet the criteria in the
preceding paragraph when the milestone is achieved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Additionally, we record royalty revenue based upon sales of products under a license when such
royalties are earned, which is generally in the quarter when the related products are sold.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Deferred revenue arises from payments received in advance of the culmination of the earnings
process. We classify as a current liability any deferred revenue that is expected to be recognized
within the next twelve months. We will recognize in future periods deferred revenue when the
applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met.

as an offset to the related research and development costs when we have complied with the
conditions attached to the grant and there is reasonable assurance that the funds will be received.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Revenue for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 decreased significantly compared to revenue for 2006
primarily due to the 2006 recognition of $14.0&nbsp;million in licensing revenue as a result of the
execution of our sublicense agreement with Nycomed and subsequent FDA approval of Elestrin in 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Research and development expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 increased 22&nbsp;percent
compared to research and development expenses for 2006 primarily as a result of increased spending
on our Phase III LibiGel clinical trial program, which commenced in December&nbsp;2006. We expect our
research and development expenses to increase in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of our Phase III
LibiGel clinical trial program, which will include two Phase III safety and efficacy trials, one of
which was initiated in December&nbsp;2006 and the other of which we expect to initiate in the first half
of 2008, and a safety study which was initiated in January&nbsp;2008. Specifically, we expect our
research and development expenses to be at least $800,000 to $1.0&nbsp;million per month during 2008
starting late in the first half of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our general and administrative expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 decreased five percent
compared to general and administrative expenses for 2006 primarily as a result of a decrease in
business development costs and a decrease in non-cash, stock-based compensation expense partially
offset by an increase in personnel-related expenses. Our non-cash, stock-based compensation
expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 decreased $365,573, or 34&nbsp;percent, compared to
non-cash, stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 primarily as a
result of $746,616 of expense that was recorded in 2006 related to the March&nbsp;2006 grant of stock
options to our non-employee directors, which options were immediately exercisable and as a result
were fully expensed on the grant date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Licensing expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 decreased significantly compared to
licensing expense for 2006 primarily due to the 2006 recognition of $3.5&nbsp;million in licensing
expense as a result of the execution of our sublicense agreement with Nycomed, subsequent FDA
approval of Elestrin in 2006 and related licensing expense to our Elestrin licensor as of December
31, 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Interest income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 increased 156&nbsp;percent compared to interest
income during 2006 primarily as a result of a higher average invested cash balances and higher
average interest rates on our invested funds.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">All of our revenue to date has been derived from upfront, milestone and royalty payments earned on
licensing and sub-licensing transactions and from subcontracts. We have not commercially
introduced any products and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future, although our
marketing sublicensee for our Elestrin product, Nycomed, commercially launched Elestrin in June
2007, as a result of which we received royalty income commencing in mid-2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our business operations to date have consisted mostly of licensing and research and development
activities, and we expect this to continue for the immediate future. If and when our proposed
products for which we have not entered into marketing relationships receive FDA approval, we may
begin to incur other expenses, including sales and marketing related expenses if we choose to
market the products ourselves. We currently do not have sufficient resources to obtain regulatory
approval of our other proposed products or to complete the commercialization of any of our proposed
products that are not licensed to others for development and marketing. We expect the Phase III
clinical trial program of LibiGel to require significant resources. Therefore, we may need to
raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations or alternatively, we may choose to
sublicense LibiGel or another product for development and commercialization, enter into other
business collaborations or combinations or sell certain assets or rights we have under our existing
license agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">To date, we have used primarily equity financings, licensing income and interest income to fund our
ongoing business operations and short-term liquidity needs, and we expect to continue this practice
for the foreseeable future. In addition, during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, we received $1.2
million in cash proceeds from stock option and warrant exercises.

million and $11.4&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2007 and December&nbsp;31, 2006, respectively. The increase
in our cash and short-term investment balances was primarily due to our receipt during 2007 of
milestone payments in the amount of $10.5&nbsp;million as a result of the execution of our sublicense
agreement with Nycomed and subsequent FDA approval of Elestrin and the completion in June&nbsp;2007 of a
private placement of 3,054,999 shares of our common stock and associated warrants to purchase
763,750 shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $17.3&nbsp;million,
after deduction of transaction expenses. These payments were offset partially by our use of cash
to fund operations, including licensing expenses to our licensor, Antares. We do not have any
outstanding debt.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, we had $15.6&nbsp;million of cash and cash equivalents and an additional $15.0

investment grade financial instruments consisting primarily of commercial paper. Our short-term
investments consist primarily of money market investments and investment-grade auction rate
securities, the underlying assets of which are portfolios of student loans backed by the federal
government. Although such securities typically have been very liquid, such liquidity recently has
been reduced as a result of recent events in the credit markets, including the market for these
auction rate securities. Although we expect the markets for auction rate securities to recover in
the near term and believe we will be able to liquidate our investments in our auction rate
securities without any significant loss, the timing of such an outcome is uncertain. Currently
there is no liquid market for these securities. Based on our expected cash expenditures, our cash
and cash equivalents balance and other potential sources of cash, including our anticipated ability
to borrow using these securities as collateral, we do not anticipate that the potential lack of
liquidity of these investments in the near term will adversely affect our ability to execute our
current business plan. However, no assurance can be provided that it will not do so.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual
rate and will be subject to auctions every 28&nbsp;days until the auction process succeeds, the issuers
redeem the securities or the underlying debt instruments mature. If we determine that an issuer of
the securities is unable to successfully close future auctions or redeem or refinance the
obligations, we might be required to reclassify the investments from a current asset to a
non-current asset. If an issuer&#146;s financial stability or credit rating deteriorates or adverse
developments occur in the bond insurance market, we might be required to adjust the carrying value
of our action rate securities through a future impairment charge. We continue to monitor the
market for auction rate securities and to consider its impact (if any) on the fair market value of
our investments. We currently believe the market values of our auction
rate securities are not significantly impaired, primarily due to
government agency backing of the underlying securities and the
investment-grade credit rating of each auction rate security in our
portfolio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December&nbsp;31, 2007 will
be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for
at least the next 18&nbsp;months, and if we are unable to liquidate our auction rate securities, through
at least the next 12&nbsp;months. However, we may seek to obtain additional financing prior to that
time. Our future capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including:

used in operating activities of $5.0&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. Cash provided
by operating activities was primarily the result of the receipt of approximately $10.5&nbsp;million from
Nycomed, 25&nbsp;percent of which was due to our licensor, partially offset by our net loss of $7.6
million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. Cash used in operating activities for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 was primarily the result of the recognition of the $10.5&nbsp;million Nycomed
receivable, 25&nbsp;percent of which was due to our licensor partially offset by the net income for that
period. Net cash used in investing activities was $11.2&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2007 versus cash provided by investing activities of $5.0&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2006. Net purchases of short-term investments of $11.2&nbsp;million and net redemptions of short-term
investments of $5.0&nbsp;million were the primary reasons for the net cash used in and the net cash
provided by investing activities in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net cash provided by financing
activities for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 was $18.5&nbsp;million and resulted primarily from the
completion of a private placement in June&nbsp;2007 that resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately
$17.3&nbsp;million, after deduction of transaction expenses, and warrant and stock option exercises,
which resulted in net proceeds to us of $1.2&nbsp;million. Net cash provided by financing activities
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 was $7.4&nbsp;million and was primarily the result of the
completion of our June&nbsp;2006 private placement that resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately
$7.2&nbsp;million, after deduction of transaction expenses. In exchange for a license with MATC, we
received an ownership position in MATC of approximately five percent of the common stock of MATC.
We recorded non-cash licensing revenue of $140,000 related to this license and have recorded our investment in MATC using the cost method.

48&#148;), which provides guidance for the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 requires companies
to determine whether it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that a tax position will be sustained upon
examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any tax benefit can be recorded in the
financial statements. It
also provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, classification and interest and penalties
related to uncertain tax positions. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January&nbsp;1, 2007. The
adoption of FIN 48 did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;157,
&#147;Fair Value Measurement&#148; (&#147;SFAS 157&#148;). The standard provides guidance for using fair value to
measure assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based
on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes
a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under
the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value
hierarchy. SFAS 157 will be effective for us January&nbsp;1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 157 is not
expected to have an impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In February&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;159, &#147;The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities &#151; Including an amendment of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;115&#148; (&#147;SFAS 159&#148;). SFAS 159
permits an entity to elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for many
financial assets and liabilities. Entities electing the fair value option are required to
recognize changes in fair value in earnings. SFAS 159 also requires additional disclosures to
compensate for the lack of comparability that will arise from the use of the fair value option.
SFAS 159 will be effective for us beginning January&nbsp;1, 2008. The adjustment to reflect the
difference between the fair value and the carrying amount would be accounted for as a
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of initial adoption. We do not
expect to elect the fair value option for any of its existing financial assets and liabilities, and
therefore the adoption of SFAS 159 is not expected to have an impact on our current results of
operations or financial condition. The future impact, if any on our results of operations or
financial condition of electing the fair value option for future financial assets and liabilities,
is not known.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue (&#147;EITF&#148;) Issue No.&nbsp;07-1,
&#147;Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements&#148; (&#147;EITF 07-1&#148;). EITF 07-1 provides guidance on how to
determine whether an arrangement constitutes a collaborative arrangements, how costs incurred and
revenue generated on sales to third parties should be reported by participants in a collaborative
arrangement, how payments made between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be
categorized, and what participants should disclose in the notes to the financial statements about a
collaborative arrangement. EITF 07-1 is effective for the fiscal year beginning January&nbsp;1, 2009.
EITF 07-1 requires that the impact of adopting the issue for all arrangements existing as of the
effective date be presented as a change in accounting principle through retrospective application
to all prior periods presented. We have not yet determined the impact, if any, that the adoption
of EITF 07-1 will have on our results of operations or financial condition.

Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development
Activities&#148; (&#147;EITF 07-3&#148;). EITF 07-3 requires non-refundable advance payments for goods and
services to be used in future research and development (R&#038;D) activities to be recorded as assets
and the payments to be expensed when the R&#038;D activities are performed. EITF 07-3 is effective for
us prospectively for new contractual arrangements entered into beginning January&nbsp;1, 2008. We have

that the purchase method be used for all business combinations. SFAS 141(R) defines the acquirer as
the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination, establishes
the
acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control and requires the acquirer to
recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest at their fair
values as of the acquisition date. SFAS 141(R) also requires that acquisition-related costs be

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are exposed to interest rate risk on the investments of our excess cash and short-term
investments, although due to the nature of our short-term investments, we have concluded that such
risk is not material. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal
while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this
objective, we typically have invested in highly liquid and high quality debt securities. To
minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates, we typically have invested in
short-term securities with maturities of less than one year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2007, we held investments in $14.5&nbsp;million of investment-grade auction rate
securities, the underlying assets of which are student loans backed by the federal government.
Although such securities typically have been very liquid, such liquidity recently has been impacted
as a result of recent events in the credit markets, including the markets for these securities, and
currently there is no liquid market for these securities. Although we believe we will be able to
liquidate our investments in our auction rate securities in the near term without any significant
loss, the timing of such an outcome is uncertain. Therefore, we are exposed to market risk related
to our investments in auction rate securities. For further details, see &#147;Item&nbsp;7. Management&#146;s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Liquidity and Capital
Resources.&#148;

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As management of BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc., we are responsible for establishing and
maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for BioSante
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">BioSante&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of BioSante; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of BioSante are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of BioSante; and
(iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of BioSante&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projection of
any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods
is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">With our participation, management evaluated the effectiveness of BioSante&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2007. In making this evaluation, management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management concluded that
BioSante&#146;s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain

audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company&#146;s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company&#146;s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2007, based on the criteria established in <I>Internal
Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the financial statements as of and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 of
the Company and our report dated March&nbsp;17, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements.

    <TD>BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) was established to develop prescription
pharmaceutical products, vaccines, vaccine adjuvants and drug delivery systems using its
nanoparticle technology (&#147;CaP&#148;) licensed from the University of California. The research
and development on the CaP technology is conducted in the Company&#146;s Doylestown, Pennsylvania
laboratory facility. In addition to its nanoparticle technology, the Company also has been
developing its pipeline of hormone therapy products to treat men and women, many of which
products were licensed from Antares Pharma, Inc. The Company&#146;s business office is located
in Lincolnshire, Illinois. The Company had been considered a development stage enterprise
through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter of 2006. With the recognition of
significant licensing revenues as a result of the Company&#146;s first FDA approved product
during the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company is no longer a development stage company.</TD>

as &#147;available for sale&#148; under the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;115, &#147;Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.&#148; Accordingly, the short-term investments are
reported at fair value, with any related unrealized gains and losses included as a separate
component of stockholders&#146; equity, net of applicable taxes. Realized gains and losses and
interest and dividends are included in interest income. Realized gains and losses are
recorded based upon the specific identification method.</TD>

    <TD>The fair value of investments is determined based on quoted market prices at the reporting
date for those instruments. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, and December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company had
$15.0&nbsp;million and $3.8&nbsp;million of short-term investments, respectively. The investment
balance consisted of auction rate securities investments of $14.5&nbsp;million and money market
fund investments of approximately $500,000 as of December&nbsp;31, 2007, and of auction rate
securities investments of $3.5&nbsp;million and money market fund investments of approximately
$300,000 as of December&nbsp;31, 2006. There were no gains or losses recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income as of December&nbsp;31, 2007 or December&nbsp;31, 2006, and there were no
realized gains or losses included in earnings as the result of sale of available for sale
securities for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, December&nbsp;31, 2006 or December&nbsp;31, 2005.</TD>

    <TD>As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Company&#146;s investments had maturity dates ranging from May&nbsp;1,
2030 to May&nbsp;1, 2046. Despite the long-term contractual maturities of the underlying debt of
the auction rate securities held at December&nbsp;31, 2007, all of these securities were
classified as short-term investments as it was the Company&#146;s intention to liquidate these
securities within one year.</TD>

    <TD>Liquidity for our auction rate securities typically has been provided by an auction process
which has allowed us the opportunity to sell the securities at each auction date, and for
those securities not sold, resets the applicable interest rate every 28&nbsp;days. Although
auctions have been successful for periods immediately subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2007,
recently auctions for our auction rate securities have failed which therefore have
eliminated our ability to sell these securities through the standard auction process.
Currently there is no liquid market for these securities. There is no assurance that future
auctions in our auction rate securities will succeed. An auction failure means that the
parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of
buyers. In the event that there is a failed auction the indenture governing the security
requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate which may or may not
correspond to market rates for other types of similar short-term instruments. Our
securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the
contractual rate and be subject to the auction process every 28&nbsp;days until the auction
succeeds, the issuer redeems the securities or they mature. As a result, our ability to
liquidate our investment in these securities and use the cash proceeds to operate our
business in the near term may be limited. Our ability to fully recover the carrying value
of our investment in these securities may also be limited or non-existent in the near term.
However, these recent developments may result in the classification of some or all of these
securities as long-term investments in our future financial statements.</TD>

    <TD>All of the underlying assets of our auction rate securities
are student loans substantially all of which are
backed by the federal government under the Federal Family Education
Loan Program. Substantially all of our auction rate securities are currently rated AAA, the highest rating available by a
rating agency. However, it
could take until the final maturity or issuer refinancing of the underlying debt for us to
realize the recorded value of our investments in these securities. If the issuers of our
auction rate securities are unable to successfully close future auctions or redeem or
refinance the securities and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be
required to record an impairment charge on these investments, and may need to sell
these securities on a secondary market. Although we believe we will be able to liquidate our
investments in these securities without any significant loss, the timing and financial
impact of such an outcome is uncertain.</TD>

    <TD>The basic and diluted net (loss)&nbsp;per income share is computed based on the weighted average
number of the aggregate of common stock and Class&nbsp;C shares outstanding, all being considered
as equivalent of one another. Basic (loss)&nbsp;income per share is computed by dividing (loss)
income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
for the reporting period. Diluted (loss)&nbsp;income per share reflects the potential dilution
that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock. The computation of diluted (loss)&nbsp;income per share does not
include the Company&#146;s stock options or warrants when there is an antidilutive effect on
income (loss)&nbsp;per share. Certain options and warrants had a dilutive effect under the
treasury stock method as the average market price of the common stock during the period
exceeded the exercise price of the options or warrants. 292,965
shares were added to the basic weighted average number of shares
outstanding to determine the fully diluted weighted average number of
shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2006.</TD>

Payment&#148; (&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R)&#148;) under the modified prospective method on January&nbsp;1, 2006.
Under the &#147;modified prospective&#148; method, compensation cost is recognized in the financial
statements beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R)
for all share-based payments granted after that date, and based on the requirements of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123, &#147;Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation&#148; (&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;123&#148;) for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date
of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R). SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) eliminates the intrinsic value measurement method of
accounting in APB Opinion 25 and generally requires measuring the cost of the employee
services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of
the award on the date of the grant. The standard requires grant date fair value to be
estimated using either an option-pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the
award or a market observed price, if such a price exists. Such costs must be recognized
over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the
award. The standard also requires estimating the number of instruments that will ultimately
be issued, rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur.</TD>

has a contractual right to receive such payment, the contract price is fixed or
determinable, the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and the
Company has no further performance obligations under the license agreement. Non-refundable
license fees that meet these criteria and are due to the Company upon execution of an
agreement are recognized as revenue immediately.

requires companies to determine whether it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any tax
benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. It also provides guidance on the

should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or

SFAS 159 permits an entity to elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement
attribute for many financial assets and liabilities. Entities electing the fair value
option are required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings. SFAS 159 also requires
additional disclosures to compensate for the lack of comparability that will arise from the

    <TD>As allowed by the licensing agreement with Antares, on September&nbsp;1, 2000, the Company
entered into a sub-license agreement with Paladin Labs Inc. (Paladin) to market the hormone
therapy products in Canada. In exchange for the sub-license, Paladin agreed to make an
initial investment in the Company, milestone payments and pay royalties on sales of the
products in Canada. The milestone payments, to date, have been made in the form of a series
of equity investments by Paladin in the Company&#146;s common stock at a 10&nbsp;percent premium to
the market price of the Company&#146;s common stock at the date of the equity investment. These
equity investments resulted in the Company issuing a total of 1,368 shares of its common
stock to Paladin at a 10&nbsp;percent premium to the Company&#146;s market price in 2006. The dollar
value of the premium, $6,250, was recorded as equity in the statements of stockholders&#146;
equity for 2006. No shares were issued to Paladin in 2007.</TD>

    <TD>On August&nbsp;7, 2001, the Company entered into a sub-license agreement with Solvay
Pharmaceuticals, B.V. (Solvay) covering the U.S. and Canadian rights to the
estrogen/progestogen combination transdermal hormone therapy gel product licensed from
Antares in June&nbsp;2000. Under the terms of the agreement, Solvay sub-licenses the Company&#146;s
estrogen/progestogen combination transdermal hormone gel product for an initial payment of
$2.5&nbsp;million ($1.7&nbsp;million net of the related payments due to Antares and Paladin), future
milestone payments and escalating sales-based royalties. Solvay has been responsible for
all costs of development of the product to date. We believe that the hormone therapy
product licensed to Solvay is not in active development by Solvay and the Company does not
expect its active development to occur at any time in the near future.</TD>

Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Bradley&#148;) for the marketing of Elestrin, the Company&#146;s estradiol
gel, in the United States. Effective February&nbsp;21, 2008, Nycomed US Inc. (&#147;Nycomed&#148;)
completed its acquisition of Bradley. As a result, all references to Bradley have been
changed to Nycomed in these financial statement and the notes hereto. Upon execution of the
sublicense agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of $3.5&nbsp;million. In addition,
Nycomed paid the Company $7.0&nbsp;million and $3.5&nbsp;million in the first and fourth quarters of
2007, respectively, both triggered by the FDA approval of Elestrin in the U.S., which
occurred in the fourth quarter of 2006. The Company licenses the transdermal estradiol gel
formulation that is used in Elestrin from Antares Pharma IPL AG (&#147;Antares&#148;). Under its
license agreement with Antares, the Company is obligated to pay Antares 25&nbsp;percent of all
licensing-related proceeds and a portion of any future associated royalties that the Company may receive.
As a result, the Company was required to pay Antares
$2.625&nbsp;million and $875,000 during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and
December&nbsp;31, 2006, respectively. The aggregate $14.0&nbsp;million received from Nycomed
(consisting of the following amounts paid by Nycomed to the Company: $3.5&nbsp;million in the
fourth quarter of 2006, $7.0&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2007 and $3.5&nbsp;million in the
fourth quarter of 2007) was recognized as revenue in 2006 since the entire $14.0&nbsp;million was
non-refundable, the Company had a contractual right to receive such payments, the contract
price was fixed, the collection of the resulting receivable was reasonably assured and the
Company had no further performance obligations under the license agreement. Nycomed also
has agreed to pay the Company additional payments of up to $40&nbsp;million in the event certain
sales-based milestones are achieved, plus royalties on sales of Elestrin which totaled
$69,353 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. The Company is obligated to pay 25&nbsp;percent of
any sales-based milestone payments and a specified portion of royalties to Antares, which
the Company will recognize as these payments are triggered, based on reported levels of
Elestrin sales. Nycomed began its commercial launch of Elestrin in June&nbsp;2007.</TD>

Aesthetics Technology Corporation (&#147;MATC&#148;) for the use of the Company&#146;s CaP technology in

continued development of BioLook, including required clinical trials, regulatory filings and
all manufacturing and marketing associated with the product. In exchange for this license,
the Company has taken an ownership position in MATC of approximately five percent of the
common shares of MATC. In addition to the ownership position, the Company may receive
certain milestone payments and royalties as well as share in certain payments if MATC
sublicenses the technology. The Company recorded an investment asset and licensing revenue
of $140,000 related to this license and ownership position in MATC. The MATC investment is

    <TD>The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;48, &#147;Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes &#151; an interpretation of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109&#148;, or FIN 48, on
January&nbsp;1, 2007. FIN 48 requires companies to determine whether it is &#147;more likely than
not&#148; that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing
authorities before any tax benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. It also
provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, classification and interest and penalties
related to uncertain tax positions. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have an impact on the
Company&#146;s financial position upon adoption. The Company
determined there are no uncertain tax positions existing as of
January&nbsp;1, 2007 or December&nbsp;31, 2007.</TD>

    <TD>The Company has no current tax provision due to its accumulated losses, which result in net
operating loss carryforwards. At December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Company had approximately
$46,591,767 of net operating loss carryforwards that are available to reduce future taxable
income for a period of up to 20&nbsp;years. The net operating loss carryforwards expire in the
years 2018-2027. The net operating loss carryforwards as well as amortization of various
intangibles, principally acquired in-process research and development, generate deferred tax
benefits, which have been recorded as deferred tax assets and are entirely offset by a tax
valuation allowance. The valuation allowance has been provided at 100% to reduce the
deferred tax assets to zero, the amount management believes is more likely than not to be
realized. Additionally, the Company
has provided a full valuation allowance against $2,569,848 of research and development
credits, which are available to reduce future income taxes, if any, through the year 2027.</TD>

    <TD>The BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Amended and Restated 1998 Stock Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) permits
the grant of stock options and stock awards to its employees, directors and consultants. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2007, 3,000,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock were reserved for
issuance under the Plan, subject to adjustment as provided in the plan. As of December&nbsp;31,
2007, 1,209,336 of the 3,000,000 shares remained available for issuance. The Company
believes that equity-based incentives, such as stock options and stock awards, align the
interest of its employees and directors with those of its stockholders. Options are
generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company&#146;s common
stock on the date of the grant; outstanding employee stock options generally vest ratably
over a period of time and have 10-year contractual terms. During 2006, stock options were
granted to directors which were exercisable immediately. As a result, stock-based
compensation expense was recognized on the grant date in an amount equal to the fair value
of the related options. No stock awards have been granted under the Plan. The Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company may at its sole discretion modify or
accelerate the vesting of any stock option or stock award at any time but may not reprice
any outstanding options without obtaining stockholder approval.</TD>

    <TD>The Company uses a volatility rate calculation based on the closing price for its common
stock at the end of each calendar month as reported by the NASDAQ Global Market (or The
American Stock Exchange prior to November&nbsp;5, 2007). Since the Company has a limited history
with option exercises, the expected life was set to the entire life of the option grant
through the fourth
quarter of 2007. Beginning with options granted during the fourth quarter 2007, the Company
began estimating the expected life of its options in a manner consistent with SAB 107, which
allows companies to use a simplified method to estimate the life of options meeting certain
criteria. The Company believes that the use of the simplified method provides a reasonable
term for purposes of determining compensation costs for these grants, and expects to use the
simplified method to estimate the expected life of future options for eligible grants. The
discount rate used
is the yield on a United States Treasury note as of the grant date with a maturity equal to
the estimated life of the option. The Company has not in the past issued a cash dividend,
nor does it have any current plans to do so in the future; therefore, an expected dividend
yield of zero was used.</TD>

    <TD>In August&nbsp;2006, the Company entered into a Fourth Amendment to Exclusive License Agreement
for patents related to the Company&#146;s CaP technology with The Regents of the University of
California. Under the terms of the amendment, the Company amended certain terms of the
agreement, including the elimination of future specified minimum annual royalties which
equal in excess of $3&nbsp;million owed to the University of California in exchange for an
immediate payment of $100,000. Under the terms of the original agreement, $75,000 would
have been due on February&nbsp;28, 2007 for which the Company had accrued $37,500 at the time of
the amendment. No future minimum royalty payments are required under the amended contract.</TD>

    <TD>In April&nbsp;2002, the Company exclusively in-licensed from Wake Forest University and
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center three issued U.S. patents claiming triple hormone therapy (the
combination use of estrogen plus progestogen plus androgen, e.g. testosterone) and obtained
an option to license the patents for triple hormone contraception. The financial terms of
the license include an upfront payment by the Company in exchange for exclusive rights to
the license and regulatory milestone payments, maintenance payments and royalty payments by
the Company if a product incorporating the licensed technology gets approved and
subsequently marketed. In July&nbsp;2005, the Company exercised the option for an exclusive
license for the three U.S. patents for triple hormone contraception. The financial terms of
this license include an upfront payment, regulatory milestone payments, maintenance payments
and royalty payments by the Company if a product incorporating the licensed technology gets

    <TD>In February&nbsp;2006, the Company signed an exclusive option and license agreement with Medical
Aesthetics Technology Corporation for the use of the Company&#146;s CaP technology in the field

the Company&#146;s CaP technology to develop products for commercialization in the field of
aesthetic medicine, specifically, the improvement and/or maintenance of the external
appearance of the head, face, neck and body. In November&nbsp;2007, the Company exercised its
options under the license and signed a license agreement with MATC covering the use of the
Company&#146;s CaP as a facial filler (BioLook&#153;) in aesthetic medicine. Under the agreement,
MATC is responsible for continued development of BioLook, including required clinical
trials, regulatory filings and all manufacturing and marketing associated with the product.
In exchange for the license, the Company has taken an ownership position in MATC of about
five percent of the common shares of MATC. In addition to the ownership position, the
Company may receive certain milestone payments and royalties as well as share in certain
payments if MATC sublicenses the technology. The Company recorded an investment asset and
licensing revenue of $140,000 related to this license and ownership position in MATC. The
MATC investment is recorded using the cost-method.</TD>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules&nbsp;13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to reasonably ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#146;s rules and forms and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls
and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we
are required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible internal
controls. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered in this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on
that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of such period to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules
and forms, and that material information relating to our company is made known to management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, particularly during the period
when our periodic reports are being prepared.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On March&nbsp;11, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a form of indemnification agreement to be
entered into with each of our current directors and executive officers (each, the &#147;Indemnitee&#148;).
The indemnification agreements provide, among other things, subject to the procedures set forth in
the indemnification agreements: (i)&nbsp;that we will indemnify the Indemnitee to the fullest extent
permitted by our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and the Delaware General
Corporation Law in the event the Indemnitee was or is a party to or involved with an action, suit
or proceeding by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was serving as one of our officers or directors; (ii)
that we will advance expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in any such proceeding, including
attorneys&#146; fees, to the Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding; (iii)
that the rights of the Indemnitees under the indemnification agreements are in addition to any
other rights the Indemnitees may have under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation,
Bylaws, the Delaware General Corporation Law or otherwise; and (iv)&nbsp;for certain exclusions from our
obligations under the agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Pursuant to the indemnification agreements, we have agreed to refrain from amending our Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws to diminish the Indemnitees&#146; rights to
indemnification under the indemnification agreements. We have also agreed to maintain directors&#146;
and officers&#146; liability insurance coverage for our directors and officers, so long as such
insurance is available on a commercially reasonable basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The summary of the indemnification agreements described above is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the form of indemnification agreement attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;10.30 and
incorporated herein by reference.
