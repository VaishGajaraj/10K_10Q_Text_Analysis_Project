     The sales information presented above excludes the sales by the Company's
unconsolidated joint ventures. See "Joint Ventures." Such sales totaled
approximately $300 million in 2001, $348 million in 2000 and $287 million in
1999. Divested operations and businesses held for sale includes the fuel systems
business which was sold in April 2001, the HVAC business which was sold in 2000,
and the forged powdered metal race business sold in 1999.

Air/Fluid Systems

     Air/Fluid Systems designs and manufactures sophisticated
electro-mechanical, mechanical and electronic components and systems used for
automated transmissions, fluid pumps, engine air intake modules, engine emission
controls and actuation systems. Key products for transmission controls include
single function solenoids, complex solenoids and multi-function modules. The
Company also manufactures a wide variety of fluid pumps, including engine
hydraulic pumps for variable cam timing and engine lubrication. Key products for
engine air intake management include throttle bodies, intake manifolds, throttle
position sensors and complete engine induction systems. The Company also designs
and manufactures products to control emissions and improve gas mileage such as
electric air pumps, air control valves and exhaust gas recirculation valves.
These products are provided from facilities in the United States and France.

Cooling Systems

     Cooling Systems, the Company's newest segment, is a combination of the
cooling systems businesses acquired from Eaton Corporation and the Schwitzer
group, which was acquired as part of the Kuhlman Corporation acquisition in
1999. Cooling Systems is a global provider of engine cooling solutions.  The
group manufactures and markets air sensing fan drives that can be mechanically
or electronically controlled, and also manufactures and markets polymer fans for
engine cooling systems.  Product features provide improved vehicle fuel economy
and reduced engine emissions while minimizing parasitic horsepower loss.  These
advanced cooling systems products are manufactured by QS Quality Certified
facilities in the U.S., Germany, U.K., Brazil, Korea and China.  The Company is
a leading global provider of such products, but competes with other large
independent producers as well as divisions of its OEM customers.  This business
serves the global light, medium, and heavy vehicle markets, as well as selected
off-highway applications.

Morse TEC

     Morse TEC manufactures chain and chain systems, including HY-VO(R)
front-wheel drive ("FWD") transmission chain and four-wheel drive ("4WD") chain,
MORSE GEMINI(R) Chain Systems, timing chain and timing chain systems, crankshaft
and camshaft sprockets, chain tensioners and snubbers and turbochargers for
passenger car and commercial vehicle applications. These products are provided
from facilities in North America, South America, Europe and Asia.

     HY-VO(R) chain is used in transmissions and for 4WD transfer case
applications. Transmission chain is used to transfer power from the engine to
the transmission. The Company's MORSE GEMINI(R) Chain System emits significantly
less chain pitch frequency noise than conventional transmission chain systems.
The chain in a transfer case distributes power between the front and rear output
shafts which, in turn, drive the front and rear wheels. The Company believes it
is the world's leading manufacturer of chain for FWD transmissions and 4WD
transfer cases.

     The Company's timing chain system is used on Ford's family of overhead cam
engines, including the Duratech and Triton and new in-line 4 cylinder engines,
as well as Chrysler's 2.7 liter, 3.7 liter and 4.7 liter overhead cam engines.
The Company has been selected to provide timing systems for a number of Japanese
and European applications.  The Company believes that it is the world's leading
manufacturer of timing chain systems.

     Morse TEC also provides turbochargers for passenger car, commercial vehicle
and industrial applications for diesel and gasoline engine manufacturers in
Europe, North America, South America and Asia. A turbocharger is a device
designed to force additional intake air into the engine to create a cleaner and
more powerful ignition. Benefits of turbocharging in both passenger car and
commercial vehicle applications include greater power for a given engine size,
improved fuel economy and significantly reduced emissions. The Company believes
it is a leading manufacturer of turbochargers worldwide.

TorqTransfer Systems

     TorqTransfer Systems' products include 4WD and all-wheel drive transfer
cases and torque management systems to transfer torque within the drivetrain for
rear wheel drive and FWD based vehicles. The main focus is on electronically
controlled torque management devices and systems.  TorqTransfer Systems'
products are manufactured in North America, Asia and Europe.

     Transfer cases are installed primarily on light trucks and sport-utility
vehicles. A transfer case attaches to the transmission and distributes torque to
the front and rear axles for 4WD, improving vehicle control during off-road use
and in a variety of road conditions. The Company has designed and developed an
exclusive 4WD TORQUE-ON-DEMAND(R) ("TOD") transfer case system, which allows
vehicles to automatically shift from two-wheel drive to 4WD when electronic
sensors indicate it is necessary. The TOD(R) transfer case is available on the
Ford Explorer, the best selling sport-utility vehicle in the United States in
2000, 1999 and 1998, and the Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator, Isuzu Trooper
and SsangYong Musso.  In 2001, this technology was also adopted by Hyundai for
its Terracan SUV, and will be launched on the Kia Sorento in 2002.

     Sales of 4WD transfer cases represented 20%, 19% and 22% of the Company's
total revenues for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company believes it is
the world's leading independent manufacturer of 4WD transfer cases, producing
approximately one million transfer cases in 2001. The Company's largest customer
of 4WD transfer cases is Ford Motor Company. The Company supplies the majority
of the 4WD transfer cases for Ford, including those installed in the Ford
Explorer, the Ford Expedition, the Ford F-150 and Ranger pick-up trucks, the
Mercury Mountaineer and the Lincoln Navigator.

     Our newest four-wheel drive product is the INTERACTIVE TORQUE
MANAGEMENT(TM) system.  This product was introduced on the Acura MDX in 2000 and
will be launched on the New Honda Pilot in 2002. This product uses
electronically controlled clutches to distribute power to the individual rear
wheels when traction is required. The Company is actively involved in developing
this technology for new applications in both front wheel drive based crossover
vehicles and passenger cars.  A variant of this product, ITM 1,(TM) which
features a single clutch pack in front of the rear axle differential, will be
launched on the Hyundai Santa Fe in 2002.

Transmission Systems

     The Company engineers and manufactures components for automatic
transmissions and the systems that combine such components in North America,
Asia and Europe.  Principal product lines include friction plates, one-way
clutches, transmission bands and torque converter lock-up clutches for automatic
transmissions. The Company is a supplier to virtually every major automatic
transmission manufacturer in the world. The Company's 50%-owned joint venture in
Japan, NSK-Warner Kabushiki Kaisha ("NSK-Warner"), is a leading producer of
friction plates and one-way clutches in Japan.

Joint Ventures

     As of December 31, 2001, the Company had six joint ventures in which it has
a less-than-100% ownership interest. Results from four of these ventures, in
which the Company is the majority owner, are consolidated as part of the
Company's results. The Company's ownership interest in NSK-Warner and Hitachi
Warner is 50% each. This is reported using the equity method of accounting.

     Management of the unconsolidated joint ventures is shared with the
Company's respective joint venture partners. Certain information concerning the
Company's joint ventures is set forth below:

Statements on pages 46 through 48 of the Company's Annual
 Report for geographic information.


Customers

     Approximately 77% of the Company's total sales in 2001 were to automotive
OEMs, with the remaining 23% of the Company's sales to a diversified group of
industrial, construction and agricultural vehicle manufacturers, auto part
manufacturers and to distributors of automotive aftermarket and replacement
parts.

     The Company's worldwide sales in 2001 to Ford, DaimlerChrysler Corporation
and General Motors Corporation constituted approximately 30%, 21% and 12%,
respectively, of its 2001 consolidated sales. Approximately 28% of consolidated
sales for 2001 were outside the United States, including exports. However, a
substantial portion of such sales were to foreign OEMs of vehicles that are, in
turn, exported to the United States. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements on pages 46 through 48 of the Company's Annual Report.

     The Company's automotive products are generally sold directly to OEMs
substantially pursuant to either negotiated long term supply agreements or terms
and conditions as may be modified by the parties. Deliveries are subject to
periodic authorizations based upon the production schedules of the OEMs. The
Company ships its products directly from its plants to the OEMs.

Sales and Marketing

     Each of the Company's operating segments has its own sales function headed
by a vice president of sales. Account executives for each group are assigned to
serve specific OEM customers for one or more of a business group's products.
Such account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with
OEM purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing
existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business. Because of
their close relationship with the OEMs, account executives are able to identify
and meet customers' needs based upon their knowledge of the Company's products
and design and manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new order, account
executives participate in product launch team activities as a key interface to
the customers.

Research and Development

     Each of the Company's operating segments has its own research and
development ("R&D") organization.  Four hundred and eighty-seven employees,
including engineers, mechanics and technicians, are engaged in R&D activities at
Company facilities worldwide. The Company also operates testing facilities such
as prototype, measurement and calibration, life testing and dynamometer
laboratories.

     By working closely with the OEMs and anticipating their future product
needs, the Company's R&D personnel conceive, design, develop and manufacture new
proprietary automotive components and systems. R&D personnel also work to
improve current products and production processes. The Company believes its
commitment to R&D will allow it to obtain new orders from its OEM customers.

     Consistent with its strategy of developing technologically innovative
products, the Company spent approximately $104.5 million, $112.0 million and
$91.6 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, on R&D activities. Not
included in the reported R&D activities were customer-sponsored R&D activities
that were approximately $20.0 million, $12.5 million and $9.4 million in 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively.

Patents and Licenses

     The Company has approximately 2,800 active domestic and foreign patents and
patent applications pending or under preparation, and receives royalties from
licensing patent rights to others. While it considers its patents on the whole
to be important, the Company does not consider any single patent, group of
related patents or any single license essential to its operations in the
aggregate or to the operations of any of the Company's business groups
individually. The expiration of the patents individually and in the aggregate is
not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or
future operating results. The Company owns numerous trademarks, some of which
are valuable but none of which are essential to its business in the aggregate.

     The Company owns the "BorgWarner" and "Borg-Warner Automotive" trade names
and housemarks, and variations thereof, which are material to the Company's
business.

Competition

     Each of the Company's operating segments competes worldwide with a number
of other manufacturers and distributors which produce and sell similar products.
Price, quality and technological innovation are the primary elements of
competition. Competitors include vertically integrated units of the Company's
major OEM customers, as well as a large number of independent domestic and
international suppliers (some of which were formerly part of our OEM customers).
Many of these companies are larger and have greater resources than the Company.

     A number of the Company's major OEM customers manufacture, for their own
use and for others, products which compete with the Company's products. Although
these OEM customers have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside
suppliers, the OEMs could elect to manufacture products to meet their own
requirements or to compete with the Company. There can be no assurance that the
Company's business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in
the markets in which it operates.

     The competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few
years as the Company's traditional United States OEM customers, faced with
intense international competition, have expanded their worldwide sourcing of
components. As a result, the Company has experienced competition from suppliers
in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor
costs, lower health care costs and, in some cases, export subsidies and/or raw
materials subsidies.

Employees

     As of December 31, 2001, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries had
approximately 13,000 salaried and hourly employees (as compared with
approximately 14,000 employees at December 31, 2000), of which approximately
8,100 were U.S. employees. Approximately 40% of the Company's domestic hourly
workers are unionized. The hourly workers at the Company's European facilities
are also unionized. The Company believes its present relations with employees to
be satisfactory.

Raw Materials

     Each of the Company's operating segments believes that its supplies of raw
materials for manufacturing requirements in 2002 are adequate and are available
from multiple sources. It is common, however, for customers to require their
prior approval before certain raw materials or components can be used, thereby
reducing sources of supply that would otherwise be available. Manufacturing
operations for each of the Company's operating segments are dependent upon
natural gas, fuel oil, propane and electricity.

Environmental Regulation and Proceedings

     The Company's operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign
laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge
to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and
disposal of waste and other materials. The Company believes that it has operated
its business and facilities in compliance in all material respects with
applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, many of
which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations.
However, the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in
these areas even for a company complying with all laws, and there can be no
assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or liabilities. In
addition, through various acquisitions over the years, the Company has acquired
a number of manufacturing facilities and there can be no assurance that the
Company will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities
which predate the Company's ownership. In addition, potentially significant
expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental
and health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or
imposed in the future.

     The Company believes that the overall impact of compliance with regulations
and legislation protecting the environment will not have a material effect on
its financial position or future operating results, although no assurance can be
given in this regard. Capital expenditures and expenses in 2001 attributable to
compliance with such legislation were not material.

     The Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect
corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental
agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") at
various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("Superfund") and equivalent state laws
and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial
activities at 43 such sites. Responsibility for cleanup and other remedial
activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an
allocation formula.

     Based on information available to the Company which, in most cases,
includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among PRPs; the probability
that other PRPs, many of whom are large, solvent public companies, will fully
pay the costs apportioned to them; currently available information from PRPs
and/or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of
contamination and estimated remediation costs; remediation alternatives;
estimated legal fees; and other factors, the Company has established a reserve
for indicated environmental liabilities in the aggregate amount of approximately
$25.5 million at December 31, 2001. The Company expects this amount to be
expended over the next three to five years.

     The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the
aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or
future operating results, generally either because estimates of the maximum
potential liability at a site are not large or because liability will be shared
with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate
outcome of any such matter.

     In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the Company
agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for certain environmental
liabilities relating to the past operations of Kuhlman Electric. During 2000,
Kuhlman Electric notified the Company that it discovered potential environmental
contamination at its Crystal Springs, Mississippi plant while undertaking an
expansion of the plant.

     The Company has been working with the Mississippi Department of
Environmental Quality and Kuhlman Electric to investigate the extent of the
contamination. The investigation has revealed the presence of PCBs in portions
of the soil at the plant and neighboring areas.   In mid 2001, Kuhlman Electric
Corporation and others, including the Company, were sued by 26 plaintiffs in
several lawsuits, which claim personal and property damage.  The Company has
moved to be dismissed from theses lawsuits.

     The Company has filed a lawsuit against Kuhlman Electric seeking a
declaration of the scope of the Company's contractual indemnity. The Company
believes that the reserve for environmental liabilities is sufficient to cover
any liability associated with this matter.

litigation liabilities in its financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the U.S. These provisions include both legal
fees and possible outcomes of legal proceedings.

litigation in which the Company is currently involved will not materially affect
its financial position or future operating results, although no assurance can be
given with respect to the ultimate outcome for any such claim or litigation.
