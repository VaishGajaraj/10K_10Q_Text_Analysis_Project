                                ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

      In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, "Applied" refers to Applied Industrial
Technologies, Inc., an Ohio corporation. References to "we," "us," "our," and
"the company" refer to Applied and its subsidiaries.

      The company is one of North America's leading industrial product
distributors. In addition, we provide fluid power, mechanical, and rubber shop
services. We offer technical application support for our products and provide
creative solutions to help customers minimize downtime and reduce overall
procurement costs. Although we do not generally manufacture the products we
sell, we do assemble and repair various products and systems. Our customers are
primarily North American industrial companies, who use our products to maintain
and to repair their machinery and equipment. We also sell for original equipment
manufacturing uses.

      Applied and its predecessor companies have engaged in this business since
1923, when The Ohio Ball Bearing Company was formed. Applied reincorporated in
Ohio in 1988.

      Applied's Internet address is www.applied.com. The following documents are
available free of charge at the investor relations area of our website:

      -     Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,

Financial Officer & Treasurer at One Applied Plaza, Cleveland, Ohio 44115.

      (a) General Development of Business.

      In fiscal 2005, we expanded into Eastern Canada by acquiring Groupe GLM, a
distributor of bearings, power transmission, and fluid power products. Groupe
GLM, which operates five facilities in northern Quebec, serves customers across
a broad range of industries, including paper, forest products, power generation,
mining, primary metals, and shipbuilding and repair.

      Additional information regarding developments in our business can be found
in our 2005 Annual Report to shareholders under the caption "Management's
Discussion and Analysis" on pages 10 through 17, which is incorporated here by
reference.

      (b) Financial Information about Segments.

      We have identified only one reportable business segment, service
center-based distribution. This business provides customers with a wide range of
industrial products through a network of service centers stretching across North
America. We also offer technical support and provide creative solutions to help
customers minimize their production downtime and reduce overall procurement
costs.

      In addition to service center-based distribution, we operate specialized
fluid power companies that primarily sell products and services directly to
customers rather than through the industrial product service centers.

      Segment financial information can be found in the 2005 Annual Report to
shareholders in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 33 and
34, and that information is incorporated here by reference.

      (c) Narrative Description of Business.

      Overview. Our field operating structure is built on two primary platforms
- industrial products, and fluid power products and systems:

      -     Industrial Products. We distribute a wide range of industrial
            products through our service centers in 47 states, Puerto Rico, five
            Canadian provinces, and six Mexican states. Customers primarily
            purchase our products for scheduled maintenance of their machinery
            and equipment and for emergency repairs. In addition, we operate
            regional fabricated rubber shops, which modify and repair conveyor
            belts and assemble hose apparatuses in accordance with customer
            requirements, and rubber service field crews, which install and
            repair belts and rubber linings at customer locations. The
            industrial products business accounts for a substantial majority of
            our field operations and sales dollars. While the industrial
            products business operates in the U.S. using the Applied Industrial
            Technologies trade name, we also are known as Bearing &
            Transmission, B&T Rubber, Groupe GLM, and Atelier PV Hydraulique in
            Canada, Applied Mexico in Mexico, and Rafael Benitez Carrillo in
            Puerto Rico.

      -     Fluid Power. Our specialized fluid power businesses primarily market
            their products and services directly to customers, but also through
            the service center network. In addition to distributing fluid power
            components, the businesses operate shops that assemble fluid power
            systems and components, perform equipment repair, and offer
            technical advice to customers. Customers include businesses
            purchasing for maintenance, repair, and operations needs, as well as
            for original equipment

                                        5
<PAGE>

            manufacturing applications. Our fluid power businesses operate in
            various geographic areas under the following names: Air and
            Hydraulics Engineering (Southeast), Air Draulics Engineering
            (Mississippi Valley), Dees Fluid Power (Mid-Atlantic and Northeast),
            Elect-Air (West Coast), Engineered Sales (Midwest), ESI Power
            Hydraulics (Midwest), HyPower (western Canada), and Kent Fluid Power
            (West Coast).

      Products. We are one of North America's leading distributors of bearings,
power transmission components, fluid power components and systems, industrial
rubber products, linear components, tools, safety products, general maintenance
products and a variety of mill supply products. Fluid power products include
hydraulic, pneumatic, lubrication, and filtration components and systems.

      These products are generally supplied to us by manufacturers for whom we
serve as a non-exclusive distributor. The product suppliers also may provide us
product training, as well as sales and marketing support. Authorizations to
represent particular suppliers and product lines may vary by geographic region.
We believe our supplier relationships are generally good, and many have existed
for decades. The disruption of relationships with certain suppliers, or the
disruption of their own operations, could adversely affect our business.

      Our product suppliers generally confine their direct sales activities to
large-volume transactions, mainly with original equipment manufacturers. The
suppliers generally do not sell maintenance and repair products directly to the
customer but instead refer the customer to us or another distributor. Of course,
there is no assurance that this practice will continue, however, and its
discontinuance could adversely affect our business.

      Net sales by product category for the most recent three fiscal years is
detailed in the 2005 Annual Report to shareholders in note 12 to the
consolidated financial statements on page 34, and that information is
incorporated here by reference.

      Services. Our service center associates advise and assist customers with
respect to industrial product selection and application, and inventory
management. We consider this advice and assistance to be an integral part of our
sales efforts. Beyond traditional parts distribution services, we offer product
and process solutions involving multiple technologies, helping to reduce
production downtime, as well as overall procurement and maintenance costs for
customers. By providing high levels of service, product and industry expertise,
and technical support, while at the same time offering competitive pricing, we
believe we develop stronger, longer-lasting, and more profitable customer
relationships.

      Our sales associates include customer sales and service representatives
and account managers, as well as product and industry specialists. Customer
sales and service representatives receive, process, and expedite customer
orders, provide product and pricing information, and assist account managers in
serving customers. Account managers make on-site calls to current and potential
customers to provide product and price information, identify customer
requirements, provide recommendations, and assist in implementing equipment
maintenance and storeroom

                                        6
<PAGE>
management programs, including our automated storeroom replenishment system,
AppliedSTORE Plus(SM). Account managers also measure and document for customers
the value of cost savings and increased productivity generated by our services
and recommendations. Product and industry specialists assist with applications
in their areas of technical expertise.

      We maintain product inventory levels at each service center tailored to
the local market. These inventories consist of standard items as well as other
items specific to local customers' immediate needs. Seven distribution centers
replenish service center inventories and also may ship products directly to
customers. The inventory maintained at our facilities allows us to satisfy our
customers' just-in-time product needs.

      Timely delivery of products is an integral part of our service,
particularly when customers require products for emergency repairs to their
machinery or equipment. Service centers and distribution centers use the most
effective method of transportation available to meet customer needs, including
our own delivery vehicles, dedicated third-party transportation providers, as
well as both surface and air common carrier and courier services. Customers can
also pick up items at our service centers.

      Our information systems enhance our ability to serve customers. While we
have long transacted with customers through electronic data interchange (EDI),
customers can also turn to our website at www.applied.com to search for products
in a comprehensive electronic database, research product attributes, view
prices, check inventory levels, place orders, and track order status. We also
interface with customers' technology platforms and plant maintenance systems.

      Along with our electronic capabilities, we support our service center
network with paper catalogs. The Applied Maintenance America(SM) product catalog
facilitates customers' purchases of general maintenance and safety products, and
tools. Our Fluid Power Connection(R) catalog does the same for hydraulic and
pneumatic components. Products from both specialty catalogs are also available
at www.applied.com.

      We supplement the service center product offering with our
MaintenancePro(R) fee-based technical training seminars. These courses provide
customer personnel with information on maintenance, troubleshooting, component
application, and failure analysis in the areas of hydraulics and pneumatics,
lubrication, bearings, and power transmission.

      In addition to distributing products, we offer shop services in select
geographic areas. Our fabricated rubber shops modify and repair conveyor belts
and provide hose assemblies (also available at select service centers and
distribution centers) in accordance with customer requirements. We also provide
field crews that install and repair belts and rubber lining, primarily at
customer locations. Among the other services we offer, either performed by us
directly or by third party providers, are the rebuilding and assembly of speed
reducers, pumps, valves, cylinders, and electric and hydraulic motors, and
custom machining.

<PAGE>

      Our specialized fluid power businesses generally operate independently of
the industrial service centers, but as product distributors, share the same
focus on customer service. Product and application recommendations, inventory
availability, and delivery speed are all key to the businesses' success. The
fluid power businesses distinguish themselves from most component distributors
by offering engineering, design, system fabrication, installation, and repair
services. Each business has account managers with extensive technical knowledge,
who handle sophisticated projects for customers primarily within the business's
geographic region. The businesses also provide technical support to our service
centers.

      Markets. We purchase from over 2,000 product manufacturers and resell the
products to many thousands of customers in a wide variety of industries,
including agriculture and food processing, automotive, chemical processing,
forest products, industrial machinery and equipment, mining, primary metals,
transportation, and utilities. Customers range from the largest industrial
concerns in North America, with whom we may have multiple-location
relationships, to the smallest. We are not significantly dependent on a single
customer or group of customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse
effect on our business as a whole, and no single customer accounts for more than
4% of our net sales.

      Competition. We consider our business to be highly competitive. In
addition, our markets present few economic or technological barriers to entry,
contributing to a high fragmentation of market share in our industry.
Longstanding supplier and customer relationships, geographic coverage, name
recognition, and our associates' experience and training do, however, support
our competitive position. Competition is based generally on breadth and quality
of product and service offerings, product availability, price, ease of product
selection and ordering, catalogs, online capability, and having a local
presence.

      Our principal competitors are other bearing, power transmission,
industrial rubber, fluid power, linear motion, and general maintenance and
safety product distributors, and, to a lesser extent, mill supply and catalog
companies. These competitors include local, regional, national, and
international operations. We also compete with original equipment manufacturers
and their distributors in the sale of maintenance and replacement components.
Some competitors have greater financial resources than we do. The identity and
number of our competitors vary throughout the geographic and product markets we
serve.

      Although we are one of the leading distributors in North America for the
major product categories we carry, our market share for those products in any
given geographic area may be relatively small compared to the portion of the
market served by original equipment manufacturers and other distributors.

      Backlog Orders and Seasonality. Because of our product resources and
distribution network, we do not have a substantial backlog of orders, nor are
backlog orders significant at any given time. Our business has exhibited minor
seasonality - in particular, sales per day during the first half of our fiscal
year have tended to be slightly lower compared with the second half due, in
part, to the impact of customer plant shutdowns and holidays.

                                        8
<PAGE>

      Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses. Customer recognition of our service
marks and trade names, including Applied Industrial Technologies(R), Applied(R),
and AIT(R), is an important contributing factor to our sales. Patents and
licenses are not of material importance to our business.

      Raw Materials and General Business Conditions. Our operations are
dependent on general industrial and economic conditions and would be adversely
affected by the unavailability of raw materials to our suppliers, prolonged
labor disputes experienced by suppliers or customers, or by any recession or
depression that has an adverse effect on North American industrial activity
generally or on key customer industries served by us.

      Number of Employees. On August 17, 2005, we had 4,415 employees.

      Working Capital. Our working capital position is discussed in
"Management's Discussion and Analysis" in the 2005 Annual Report to shareholders
on pages 12 through 14.

      We require substantial working capital related to accounts receivable and
inventories. Significant amounts of inventory are carried to meet rapid delivery
requirements of customers. We generally require payments for sales on account
within 30 days. Returns are not considered to have a material effect on our
working capital requirements. We believe these practices are generally
consistent among companies in our industry.

      Environmental Laws. We believe that compliance with laws regulating the
discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to
environmental protection will not have a material adverse effect on our capital
expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

      (d) Financial Information about Geographic Areas.

      Net sales by our Canadian and Mexican operations represented 10.4% of our
total net sales in fiscal 2005, 8.6% in fiscal 2004, and 6.8% in 2003. The
Canadian operations' sales (in U.S. dollars) were $160.4 million in 2005, $119.4
million in 2004, and $94.1 million in 2003. Long-lived assets located outside
the United States are not and have not been material.

      We believe our U.S. operations' export sales during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2005, and prior fiscal years, were less than 2% of net sales, and were
not concentrated in a specific geographic area.

      Additional information regarding our foreign operations is included in the
2005 Annual Report to shareholders in note 12 to the consolidated financial
statements on page 33 and in "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk" on page 17 and that information is incorporated here by reference.

                               ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

      We believe that having a local presence is important to serving our
customers, so we maintain service centers and other operations in local markets
in 47 states, Puerto Rico, five Canadian provinces, and six Mexican states. At
June 30, 2005 we owned real properties at 150 locations and leased 267
locations.

      Our principal owned real properties (each of which has more than 20,000
square feet of floor space) at June 30, 2005 were:

      -     the distribution center and service center in Atlanta, Georgia

      -     the distribution center in Florence, Kentucky

      -     the service center in Monroe, Louisiana

      -     the service center and rubber shop in Omaha, Nebraska

      -     the distribution center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania

      -     the distribution center and rubber shop in Fort Worth, Texas

      Our principal leased real properties (each of which has more than 20,000
square feet of floor space) at June 30, 2005 were:

      -     the corporate headquarters facility in Cleveland, Ohio

      -     the distribution center, rubber shop, and service center in Fontana,
            California

      -     the service center in Long Beach, California

      -     the service center in San Jose, California

      -     the rubber shop and fluid power shop in Tracy, California

      -     the distribution center (closed effective July 1, 2005), rubber
            shop, and service center in Denver, Colorado

      -     the fluid power sales office and warehouse in Joppa, Maryland

      -     the service center in Grand Rapids, Michigan

      -     the service center and fluid power shop in Iron Mountain, Michigan

      -     the service center and offices in Romulus, Michigan

      -     the service center in Kansas City, Missouri

      -     the inventory return center in Elyria, Ohio

      -     the distribution center in Portland, Oregon

      -     the service center in Longview, Washington

      -     the rubber shop and the fluid power and mechanical shop in Longview,
            Washington

      -     the offices, service center, and rubber shop in Appleton, Wisconsin

      -     the service center in Delta, British Columbia

      -     the service center and distribution center in Winnipeg, Manitoba

      -     the service center and fluid power shop in Sainte-Foy, Quebec

      -     the offices and fluid power shop in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan

      -     the service center in Monterrey, Mexico

                                       10
<PAGE>

      Except for the Joppa facility, all of the properties listed above are used
in our service center-based distribution segment. The Tracy, Longview (shops
facility), Delta, Saskatoon, and Winnipeg facilities are used in operations both
inside and outside the service center-based distribution segment.

      We consider our properties generally sufficient to meet our requirements
for office space and inventory stocking. A service center's size is primarily
influenced by the amount of inventory the service center requires to meet
customers' needs. We use all of our owned and leased properties except for
certain properties which in the aggregate are not material and are either for
sale, lease, or sublease to third parties due to a relocation or closing. We
also may lease or sublease to others unused portions of buildings.

      In recent years, when opening new locations, we have tended to lease
rather than purchase real property. We do not consider any of our service
center, distribution center, or shop properties to be material, because we
believe that, if it becomes necessary or desirable to relocate an operation,
other suitable property could be found.

      Additional information regarding our properties is included in the 2005
Annual Report to shareholders in note 11 to the consolidated financial
statements on page 33, and that information is incorporated here by reference.

                           ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

      Applied and/or one of its subsidiaries is a party to various judicial and
administrative proceedings. Based on circumstances currently known, we do not
believe that any liabilities that may result from these proceedings are
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

          ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

      No matters were submitted to a vote of Applied's security holders during
the last quarter of fiscal 2005.

                      EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT.

      Applied's executive officers are elected by the Board of Directors for a
term of one year, or until their successors are chosen and qualified, at the

otherwise stated, the positions and offices indicated are with Applied, and the

             Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

OVERVIEW

With more than 4,400 employee associates across North America, Applied
Industrial Technologies ("Applied," the "Company," "We" or "Our") is an
industrial distributor that offers more than two million parts critical to the
operations of MRO and OEM customers in virtually every industry. In addition,
Applied provides customized mechanical, fabricated rubber and fluid power shop
services, as well as services to meet storeroom management and maintenance
training needs. The Company has a long tradition of growth dating back to 1923,
the year our business was founded in Cleveland, Ohio. In 2005, business was
conducted in the United States, Canada and Mexico from approximately 440
facilities.

     The Company's sales, net income and earnings per share increased 13.2%,
75.8% and 68.2%, respectively, compared to the prior year. Significant factors
that contributed to these increases included the improving U.S. economy,
continued growth and increased profitability of our U.S. fluid power
subsidiaries, the continued strength of the Canadian operations, as well as the
impact of a January 2005 acquisition. Gross margin remained stable in this
period of rising prices as our initiatives in the areas of product pricing,
freight recovery, and asset management continue to show progress. During the
year, the Company recorded non-operating gains of $3.0 million related to the
proceeds received under life insurance settlements.

     Our balance sheet remains strong, as our working capital improved compared
to fiscal 2004. Cash provided from operations was over $81.0 million, nearly
doubling the prior year amount. The Company also has two $100 million
credit/financing agreements available to fund future acquisitions or other
capital and operating requirements.

     The Company monitors the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) published by the
Institute for Supply Management and the Manufacturers Capacity Utilization (MCU)
index published by the Federal Reserve Board and considers these indices key
indicators of potential Company business environment changes.

     Both the PMI and the MCU continued to reflect indicators of a growing
economy but at a slowing pace in the second half of fiscal 2005. The Company's
sales activity traditionally lags these key indicators by approximately six
months. Given the improvement in sales and the trend of these indicators, we
expect sales improvements to continue into our 2006 fiscal year, but at a
somewhat slower pace.

     We anticipate our next year sales to increase in the 7.0% to 9.0% range and
our gross profit percentage to be consistent with fiscal 2005 levels. In fiscal
2006, the gross profit margin will be highly dependent on the impact of supplier
price increases and the challenge of passing them along to our customers. While
we anticipate that the gross dollars of fiscal 2006 supplier rebates will be
consistent with the fiscal 2005 levels, the beneficial impact on our gross
profit percentage is expected to be lower due to our projected higher sales
volume. While these rebates are paid to compensate for various sales, marketing
and logistics services performed, when they are recognized in our income
statement, they are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales as required by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rules. Our aim is to keep our
growth in selling, distribution and administrative expenses for fiscal 2006 to a
rate lower than our sales increase, although we do plan to increase our rate of
investment to support additional growth.

     The major catagories on our June 30, 2005 balance sheet reflect the growth
and impact of our record sales year. The receivable and inventory increases
result directly from our sales increase and anticipated future demands. The
Company's cash balances increased over $57 million due primarily to improved
operating results. Our working capital improved in 2005, through improved cash
position and through the management of our inventory, receivable and payable
balances.

YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2005 VS. 2004

Net sales in 2005 were $1.7 billion or 13.2% above the prior year sales. This
increase was primarily due to the 11.1% improvement in our U.S. service center
sales and increased sales from our Canadian operations which were up
approximately 34.3%. The U.S. service center sales were driven by sales mix,
volume and the impact of supplier price increases passed on to customers. The
Canadian sales increase was also attributable to sales mix, pricing and volume
as well as the impact of the strength of the Canadian currency. Also
contributing to the Canadian sales increase was the inclusion of five months of
our Groupe GLM acquisition, as well as overall Canadian economy improvements.
The overall sales increase was partially offset by one less sales day in fiscal
2005 as compared to fiscal 2004.

     The sales product mix for the year was 84.0% industrial products and 16.0%
fluid power products compared to 84.4% industrial and 15.6% fluid power in the
prior year.

     There was a net increase of six facilities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico,
composed of ten new or acquired locations, one closed and three merged
facilities. At June 30, 2005, the Company had a total of 440 operating
facilities versus 434 at June 30, 2004.

     Industrial production in the United States continued to improve throughout
the year. Our industry continued to see improvement among manufacturing
customers as reflected in the PMI and MCU indices. Should the current economic
trends continue, the Company

10

<PAGE>

anticipates our positive financial results to continue. The Company does not
expect inflation or deflation to have a material impact on fiscal 2006 revenues.

     Gross profit margin was consistent at 26.5% in both 2005 and 2004. The
impact of lower freight costs and improved shop efficiencies offset the negative
pressures on gross profit margins from supplier price increases experienced
mid-year. In addition, the impact of supplier rebates on margin was consistent
in both 2005 and 2004. There were no LIFO layer liquidations in 2005, while in
fiscal 2004 LIFO layer liquidations increased gross profit by $672 thousand.

     Selling, distribution and administrative expense ("SD&A") consists of
employee compensation, benefits and other expenses associated with selling,
purchasing, warehousing, supply chain management and providing marketing and
distribution of the Company's products, as well as costs associated with a
variety of administrative functions such as legal, human resources, information
technology, treasury, accounting and facility related expenses. SD&A increased
4.6% compared to the prior year, but decreased as a percent of sales to 21.4%
from 23.1% in 2004. The overall increase was primarily due to higher associate
compensation costs related to the record sales and operating results and, to a
lesser extent, the Groupe GLM acquisition (see Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements). The current year increases were partially offset by lower
provisions for bad debts, higher gains on sales of assets and lower rent
expenses.

     Operating income increased to $88.0 million in 2005 from $51.4 million in
2004. As a percent of sales, operating income increased to 5.1% in 2005 from
3.4% in 2004. The $36.6 million increase in operating income was due primarily
to the increase in domestic same store sales, the increased profitability of our
domestic fluid power businesses and the continued improvement from our Canadian
operations.

     Interest expense-net for 2005 decreased to $4.7 million, or 12.6%, compared
with the prior year primarily due to an increase in interest income from higher
balances of temporary investments, as well as higher rates.

     The line item of Other (Income) Expense, net, represents certain
non-operating items of income and expense. Current year amounts consist
primarily of life insurance settlements.

     Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 35.9% for the
year ended June 30, 2005 and 32.3% for the year ended June 30, 2004. The fiscal
2004 rate was unusually low due to the recording of non-recurring tax benefits
from a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We expect our overall
tax rate for fiscal 2006 to rise to approximately 37.5%, as the impact of the
current year benefits of tax-free life insurance proceeds are not expected to
recur, and we expect state and local taxes to increase.

     Net income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, increased $23.9 million
or approximately 75.8% from prior years' income. Overall, net income per share
increased 68.2% to $1.80 in 2005 from $1.07 (split adjusted) in 2004 primarily
due to the factors described above.

     Effective July 1, 2005, the Company closed its Denver distribution center.
This was the Company's smallest distribution center and the least efficient from
a cost standpoint. The Company has transferred a portion of the inventory to the
area service centers to provide additional local inventory resources and
availability for emergency shipment needs. The remainder of the inventory was
transferred to our distribution centers in Texas, California and Oregon that
will now service the area previously serviced out of Denver.

     The number of Company associates was 4,441 at June 30, 2005 and 4,323 at
June 30, 2004.

YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2004 VS. 2003

Net sales in 2004 were $1.52 billion or 3.6% above the prior year sales. This
increase was primarily due to increased sales from our Canadian operations ($25
million or approximately 27%), the increase in our U.S. service center sales
beginning in February 2004, and having one additional business day during the
year. The Canadian sales increase was attributable in part (approximately 50% of
the reported increase) to the strength of the Canadian currency. Also
contributing to the Canadian sales increase was the inclusion of a full 12
months, versus nine months in fiscal 2003, of our Industrial Equipment Co. Ltd.
(IECO) acquisition, as well as overall Canadian economy improvements.

     The sales product mix for the year was 84.4% industrial products and 15.6%
fluid power products compared to 84.9% industrial and 15.1% fluid power in the
prior year.

     Although the domestic same store sales increase of approximately 0.8% was
only slightly above the prior year, the second half of our fiscal year, and
particularly our fourth quarter, same store domestic sales increased
approximately 4.8% and 6.9%, respectively. There was a net reduction of six
facilities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. At June 30, 2004, the Company had a
total of 434 operating facilities versus 440 at June 30, 2003. Industrial
production in the United States continued to improve throughout the year. Our
industry, specifically over the last five months of fiscal 2004, saw improvement
among manufacturing customers.

                                                                              11

             Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued

     Gross profit margin improved to 26.5% from 25.9% in 2003. The impact of
improved pricing initiatives, higher recovery of our shipping expenses, lower
freight costs, increased margin attributable to new product and service
offerings, our investment in training and systems and the growth of our catalog
business contributed to this increase. These were somewhat offset by a reduction
in supplier rebates in 2004 as compared to 2003. The effect of fiscal 2004 LIFO
layer liquidations increased gross profit by $672 thousand versus an increase of
$741 thousand in fiscal 2003.

     Selling, distribution and administrative expense consisted of employee
compensation, benefits and other expenses associated with purchasing,
warehousing, supply chain management and providing marketing and distribution of
the Company's products, as well as costs associated with a variety of
administrative functions such as legal, treasury, accounting, tax and facility
related expenses. SD&A increased 2.2% compared to the prior year, but decreased
slightly as a percent of sales to 23.1% from 23.4% in 2003. The increase was
primarily due to the Rodamientos y Bandas de la Laguna S.A. de C.V. (Rybalsa)
acquisition (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), higher
associate benefit costs related to stock option expensing and increased employer
401(k) plan matching due to the improved profitability compared to fiscal 2003.
SD&A, in fiscal 2003, also reflected gains on sales of assets of approximately
$3.2 million which reduced the prior year SD&A amounts for comparative purposes.
The current year increases were partially offset by a reduction in rental
expenses due to the Company buyout of certain properties under lease agreement
(see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements), and a reduction of
vehicle leasing costs.

     Operating income increased to $51.4 million in 2004 from $36.3 million in
2003. As a percent of sales, operating income increased to 3.4% in 2004 from
2.5% in 2003. The $15.2 million increase in operating income was due primarily
to the increase in domestic same store sales over the second half of our fiscal
year, the return to profitability of our domestic fluid power businesses, the
improved results from our Canadian subsidiary and the improved gross profit
margin factors noted above.

     Interest expense-net for 2004 increased slightly to $5.4 million, or 2.1%,
compared with the prior year primarily due to the effect of the exchange rates
on our Canadian dollar denominated debt.

     The line item of Other (Income) Expense, net, consisted of returns derived
from investments in assets of non-qualified benefit programs offset by the
changes in the fair value of the Company's cross currency swap (see Note 7 to
the consolidated financial statements).

     Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 32.3% for the
year ended June 30, 2004 and 35.9% for the year ended June 30, 2003. This
decrease related to non-recurring tax benefits from a settlement with the IRS
related to audits of our 1997 and 1998 tax returns and the acceptance by the IRS
of tax refund claims for 1999, 2000 and 2001.

     Net income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 increased $11.6 million
or approximately 59% from prior years' income. The impact of the LIFO
liquidation increased net income by $420 thousand or $0.01 per share compared to
an increase in net income of $453 thousand or $0.01 per share in fiscal 2003.
Overall, net income per share increased 55% to $1.07 in 2004 from $0.69 in 2003
primarily due to the factors described above.

     The number of Company associates was 4,323 at June 30, 2004 and 4,384 at
June 30, 2003.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company generated $81.0 million of cash from operating activities in 2005
and $40.9 million in 2004.

     Cash flows from operations depends primarily upon generating operating
income, controlling investment in inventories and receivables, and managing the
timing of payments to suppliers. The Company has continued to monitor and
control its investments in inventories by taking advantage of various vendor
purchasing programs and through the use of system enhancements to improve
inventory management. Inventories, excluding acquisitions, increased $10.4
million primarily due to suppliers' price increases as well as to meet
anticipated demand for our products. The Company has continued to improve its
collection of accounts receivable through improved billing systems and
collection efforts. The increase in sales and overall net income were the
primary factors in the additional operating cash generated in fiscal 2005.

     Cash used by investing activities of $12.5 million for the year ended June
30, 2005 consisted primarily of property purchases of approximately $9.2 million
which mostly consisted of computer and information technology, and the
expenditure for the purchase of Groupe GLM (see Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements).

     For fiscal 2006, our property purchases are expected to be in the $12.0
million to $13.0 million range consisting primarily of

12

additional system technology and infrastructure investments. Depreciation for
fiscal 2006 is expected to be in the range of $13.0 to $14.0 million.

     Cash used in financing activities was approximately $11.7 million in fiscal
2005 and $10.1 million in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, the Company paid a
total of $12.7 million in cash dividends to its shareholders.

     The Company also used approximately $14.6 million to repurchase 607
thousand shares during the year for an average price of approximately $24.06 per
share compared to $6.3 million for 435 thousand shares in fiscal 2004.

     The following table shows the Company's approximate obligations and
commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30,
2005 (in thousands):

     Purchase orders for inventory and other goods and services are not included
in our estimates, as purchase orders generally represent authorizations to buy
rather than binding agreements.

     The Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of the
Company's common stock, at the Company's discretion, to fund employee benefit
programs, equity award programs, and future business acquisitions. These
purchases may be made in open market and negotiated transactions, from time to
time, depending upon market conditions. At June 30, 2005, the Company has
authorization to purchase an additional 831 thousand shares.

     In fiscal 2005, the Company continued its practice of paying cash dividends
each quarter. Quarterly dividends in fiscal 2005 increased 50% over the prior
dividend rate. The increase was due to two separate dividend increases in fiscal
2005. The amount of the dividend paid is recommended quarterly by management and
approved by the Company's Board of Directors based on judgment, financial
performance, cash flow and payout guidelines consistent with other industrial
companies.

     Capital resources are obtained from income retained in the business,
borrowings under the Company's revolving credit agreement and long-term debt
facilities, and from operating lease arrangements.

     See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details regarding
the outstanding debt amounts as of June 30, 2005. The average long-term
borrowings were $75.0 million for both fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Approximately one-third of the Company's outstanding debt has been converted
from fixed rate U.S. dollar denominated debt to fixed rate Canadian dollar
denominated debt through the use of a cross currency swap. As such, the
consolidated interest expense is affected by changes in the exchange rates of
U.S. and Canadian dollars (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our long-term debt
agreements, net of the benefits from interest rate swaps, was 6.5% in 2005 and
6.3% in 2004, respectively. The increase in the weighted average interest rate
was due to the effect of the exchange rates. The Company terminated interest
rate swap agreements in fiscal 2003 or prior for favorable settlements. The
settlement gains are being amortized as a reduction in interest expense of
approximately $790 thousand per year over the remaining life of the notes
through December 2007.

     The Company manages interest rate risk through the use of a combination of
fixed rate long-term debt, variable rate borrowings under its committed
revolving credit agreement and interest rate swaps. At June 30, 2005, the
Company has no variable rate debt or interest rate swaps outstanding. See Note 7
to the consolidated financial statements "Risk Management Activities" for
additional discussion on the Company's derivative activities.

     The Company's working capital at June 30, 2005 was $345.8 million compared
to $286.0 million at June 30, 2004. The current ratio was 2.9 at June 30, 2005
and 2004. The increase in working capital is due to cash generated from our
operations and from the increase in receivables due to strong fourth quarter
sales.

     The Company has a new five-year committed revolving credit agreement, which
was entered into in June 2005 with a group of financial institutions. This
agreement provides for unsecured borrowings of up to $100.0 million. The Company
had no borrowings outstanding under this facility at June 30, 2005. Unused lines
under this facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, totaling

                                                                              13

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued

$91.5 million are available to fund future acquisitions or other capital and
operating requirements. The Company also has an uncommitted long-term financing
shelf facility enabling the Company to borrow up to $100.0 million at its
discretion with terms of up to twelve years. The Company has no outstanding
borrowings under this facility at June 30, 2005.

     The aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt are $50.0 million in
fiscal 2008 and $25.0 million in fiscal 2011.

     Management expects that cash provided from operations, available credit
facilities and the use of operating leases will be sufficient to finance normal
working capital needs, acquisitions, investments in properties, facilities and
equipment, and the purchase of additional Company common stock. Management also
believes that additional long-term debt and line of credit financing could be
obtained based on the Company's credit standing and financial strength.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates at a specific
point in time that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes. Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods
used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates are used
for, but not limited to, determining the net carrying value of trade
receivables, inventories, supplier rebates receivable, goodwill, other
long-lived assets and recording self-insurance liabilities, and other accrued
liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following
critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments,
assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements.

LIFO Inventory Valuation and Methodology

U.S. inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, using the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method, and foreign inventories are valued using the average
cost method. The Company adopted the link chain dollar value LIFO method for
accounting for domestic inventories in fiscal 1974. Approximately half of our
inventory dollars relate to LIFO layers added in the 1970's which results in a
$136.3 million excess of current cost over LIFO cost as reflected on our
consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2005. The Company maintains five LIFO
pools based on the following product groupings: bearings, power transmission
products, rubber products, fluid power products and other products. LIFO layers
and/or liquidations are determined consistently year-to-year in a manner which
is in accordance with the guidance in the 1984 AICPA LIFO Issues Paper,
"Identification and Discussion of Certain Financial Accounting and Reporting
Issues Concerning LIFO Inventories." See Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements for further information regarding inventories.

Allowances for Slow-Moving and Obsolete Inventories

The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates
appropriate loss provisions related thereto. The majority of the Company's
inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence. In addition, the Company
is generally eligible for credit or return allowances under various supplier
return programs. While the Company has no reason to believe its inventory return
privileges and programs will be discontinued in the future, its risk of loss
associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were
to occur.

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts

The Company evaluates the collectibility of trade accounts receivable based on a
combination of factors. Initially, the Company estimates an allowance for
doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt
experience. This initial estimate is adjusted based on recent trends of certain
customers and industries estimated to be a greater credit risk, trends within
the entire customer pool and as a result of changes in the overall aging of
accounts receivable. While the Company has a large customer base that is
geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry
segments in which the Company operates could result in higher than expected
defaults, and therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad debts. For the
years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 the Company recorded provisions for bad
debts of approximately $1,958, $2,527 and $2,508, respectively.

Impairment of Property & Equipment, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company evaluates property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible
assets for potential impairment indicators. The Company's judgments regarding
the existence of impairment indicators

14

<PAGE>

are based on legal factors, market conditions and operational performance.
Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators
exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired.
Evaluating the impairment also requires the Company to estimate future operating
results and cash flows which require judgment by management. Any resulting
impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial
condition and results of operations. The Company performs an annual test of
impairment on its goodwill as of January 1 or whenever conditions would indicate
an evaluation should be completed. The Company also reviews its long-lived
assets for impairment quarterly or whenever conditions would indicate an
evaluation should be completed. The Company utilizes discounted cash flow models
and market multiples for comparable businesses to determine fair value used in
the goodwill impairment evaluation. Management's estimates of fair value are
based upon factors such as projected future sales, price increases, and other
uncertain elements requiring significant judgments. While the Company uses
available information to prepare its estimates and to perform impairment
evaluations, actual results could differ significantly, resulting in future
impairment and losses related to recorded balances. As of June 30, 2005 and
2004, the Company had $55.0 million and $53.4 million, respectively of goodwill
and other intangibles, representing the costs of acquisitions in excess of fair
values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies. The Company
also had $71.4 million and $77.0 million in net property and equipment recorded
as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Based upon the Company's analysis,
management believes these assets are not impaired as of June 30, 2005.

Supplier Purchasing Programs

The Company enters into agreements with certain suppliers providing for
inventory purchase rebates. The Company's inventory purchase rebate arrangements
are unique to each supplier and are generally annual programs ending at either
the Company's fiscal year end or the supplier's year end. Rebates are received
in the form of cash or credits against purchases upon attainment of specified
purchase volumes and are received monthly, quarterly or annually based upon
actual purchases for such period. The supplier rebates are a specified
percentage of the Company's net purchases based upon achieving specific
purchasing volume levels. These percentages can increase or decrease based on
changes in the volume of purchases.

     The Company accrues for the receipt of these inventory purchase rebates
based upon actual cumulative purchases of inventory. The percentage level
utilized is based upon the estimated total volume of purchases we expect to
achieve during the life of the program. Each supplier program is analyzed,
reviewed and reconciled each quarter as information becomes available to
determine the appropriateness of the amount estimated to be received.
Differences between our estimates and actual rebates subsequently received have
not been material.

     All rebates under these supplier purchasing programs are recognized under
the Company's LIFO inventory accounting method as a reduction of cost of sales
when the inventories representing these purchases are sold and recorded as cost
of sales. The Company's accounting for rebates is in accordance with guidance
issued by the FASB in EITF 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a
Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor." While management
believes the Company will continue to receive inventory purchase rebates, there
can be no assurance that suppliers will continue to provide comparable amounts
of rebates in the future.

Self-Insurance Liabilities

The Company maintains business insurance programs with significant self-insured
retention, which cover workers' compensation, business automobile and general
product liability claims. The Company accrues estimated losses using actuarial
calculations, models and assumptions based on historical loss experience. The
Company maintains a self-insured health benefits plan, which provides medical
benefits to employees electing coverage under the plan. The Company maintains a
reserve for incurred but not reported medical claims based on historical
experience and other assumptions. The Company utilizes independent actuarial
firms to assist in determining the adequacy of all self-insurance liability
reserves. Although management believes that the estimated liabilities for
self-insurance are adequate, the estimates described above may not be indicative
of current and future losses. In addition, the actuarial calculations used to
estimate self-insurance liabilities are based on numerous assumptions, some of
which are subjective. The Company will continue to adjust its estimated
liabilities for self-insurance, as deemed necessary, in the event that future
loss experience differs from historical loss patterns.

Pension & Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

The measurement of liabilities related to pension plans and other
post-retirement benefit plans is based on management's assumptions

                                                                              15

<PAGE>

             Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued

related to future events including interest rates, return on pension plan
assets, rate of compensation increases, and healthcare cost trend rates. The
Company evaluates these assumptions and adjusts them as necessary.

Income Taxes

As of June 30, 2005, the Company had recognized $24.1 million of net deferred
tax assets. Management believes that sufficient income will be earned in the
future to realize its deferred income tax assets. The realization of these
deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates
and future taxable income levels.

Guarantees

In December 2002, FASB issued Interpretation No. (FIN) 45, "Guarantor's
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements." FIN 45 requires the disclosure of any
guarantees in place at December 31, 2002 and the recognition of a liability for
any guarantees entered into or modified after that date.

     The Company is a guarantor in connection with the construction and lease of
its corporate headquarters facility entered into prior to December 31, 2002 that
requires disclosure under FIN 45. The Company has guaranteed repayment of a
total of approximately $5.7 million of taxable development revenue bonds issued
by Cuyahoga County and the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority. These bonds
were issued with a 20-year term and are scheduled to mature in March 2016. Any
default, as defined in the guarantee agreements, would obligate Applied for the
full amount of the outstanding bonds through maturity.

     Due to the nature of the guarantee, the Company has not recorded any
liability on the financial statements. In the event of a default and subsequent
payout under this guarantee, the Company maintains the right to pursue all legal
options available to mitigate its exposure.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

The Company has examined the impact of the Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) 123(R), "Share-Based Payments." This statement revised certain
requirements of SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." The Company
will adopt SFAS 123(R) beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The
Company does not believe the application of SFAS 123(R) will have a material
impact on future financial results due to its adoption of the fair value option
under SFAS 123 in fiscal 2004 as discussed below.

     Effective July 1, 2003, the Company adopted for stock options the fair
value recognition provision of SFAS 123 using the modified prospective method
for the transition. Under the modified prospective method, stock based
compensation cost recognized during this fiscal year is the same as that which
would have been recognized had the fair value recognition provisions for stock
options been applied to all awards granted after July 1, 1995.

OTHER MATTERS

Effective January 2005, Applied Industrial Technologies Ltd., the Company's
Canadian subsidiary, acquired the stock of Groupe GLM, a Canadian distributor,
which consists of five locations in Northern Quebec for approximately $6.7
million U.S. The acquisition was paid for from existing cash balances. The
operating results are reported in our Service Center Based Distribution segment
from the acquisition date and are not considered material for the periods
presented. Groupe GLM contributed approximately $7.9 million in sales in fiscal
2005 and is currently meeting Company expectations.

     In November 2003, the Company acquired the stock of Rodamientos y Bandas de
la Laguna S.A. de C.V. (Rybalsa), a Mexican distributor of industrial products,
for approximately $2.8 million. The acquisition was paid for from existing cash
balances. The results of the acquired business operations have been combined
with our previous operations in Mexico, but are not considered material for the
periods presented. The operating results are reported in our Service Center
Based Distribution segment from the acquisition date. The business contributed
$6.0 million in sales from the date of acquisition through June 30, 2004. Sales
and operating results to date have met Company expectations.

     In October 2002, the Company acquired certain assets of Industrial
Equipment Co., Ltd. (IECO), a Canadian distributor of industrial products, for
approximately $11.5 million. This acquisition was paid for from existing cash
balances. The results of the acquired business operations are not material for
periods presented. The acquired operations are reported in our Service Center
Based Distribution segment from the acquisition date. Sales and operating
results to date have met Company expectations.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT

UNDER PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT

This Annual Report to Shareholders, including Management's Discussion and
Analysis, contains statements that are forward-looking based on management's
current expectations about the future. Forward-looking statements are often
identified by qualifiers, such as "expect," "believe," "plan," "intend," "will,"
"should," "anticipate" and similar expressions. The Company intends that the
forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors established in the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases.

     Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking
statements. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations
regarding important risk factors. Accordingly, actual results may differ
materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, and the
making of such statements should not be regarded as a representation by the
Company or any other person that the results expressed in the statements will be
achieved. In addition, the Company undertakes no obligation publicly to update
or revise any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information or
events, or otherwise.

     Important risk factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
changes in the economy or in specific customer industry sectors; reduced demand
for our products in targeted markets due to reasons including consolidation in
customer industries and the transfer of manufacturing capacity to foreign
countries; changes in interest rates and inflation; changes in customer
procurement policies and practices; changes in product manufacturer sales
policies and practices; the availability of products and labor; changes in
operating expenses; product cost and price changes; the variability and timing
of new business opportunities including acquisitions, alliances, customer
relationships and supplier authorizations; the Company's ability to realize the
anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other business strategies; the
incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions;
changes in accounting policies and practices; organizational changes within the
Company; the emergence of new competitors, including firms with greater
financial resources than the Company; risks and uncertainties associated with
the Company's foreign operations, including inflation, recessions, and foreign
currency exchange rates; adverse results in significant litigation matters;
adverse regulation and legislation; and the occurrence of extraordinary events
(including prolonged labor disputes, natural events and acts of God, terrorist
acts, fires, floods and accidents).

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company has evaluated its exposure to various market risk factors, including
but not limited to, interest rate, foreign currency exchange and commodity price
risks. The Company is primarily affected by market risk exposure through the
effect of changes in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, through the change
in exchange rates.

     The Company manages interest rate risk through the use of a combination of
fixed rate long-term debt, variable rate borrowings under its committed
revolving credit agreement and interest rate swaps. The Company had no variable
rate borrowings under its committed revolving credit agreement and no interest
rate swap agreements outstanding at June 30, 2005. All the Company's outstanding
debt is currently at fixed interest rates at June 30, 2005 and scheduled for
repayment in December 2007 and beyond.

     The Company mitigates its foreign currency exposure from the Canadian
dollar through the use of cross currency swap agreements as well as
foreign-currency denominated debt. Hedging of the U.S. dollar denominated debt,
used to fund a substantial portion of the Company's net investment in its
Canadian operations, is accomplished through the use of cross currency swaps.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument offsets the gain or loss on the
underlying debt. Translation exposures with regard to our Mexican business are
not hedged, as our Mexican activity is not material. For the year ended June 30,
2005, a uniform 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign
currencies that affect the Company would have resulted in a $0.5 million
decrease in net income. A uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have
resulted in a $0.5 million increase in net income.

                                                                              17

Notes to CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years Ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003

(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)

NOTE_1: BUSINESS AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business

Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") is one of
North America's leading distributors of industrial products. Industrial products
include bearings, power transmission components, fluid power components and
systems, industrial rubber products, linear components, tools, safety products,
general maintenance and a variety of mill supply products. Fluid power products
include hydraulic, pneumatic, lubrication and filtration components and systems.
The Company also provides mechanical, rubber shop and fluid power services. The
Company offers technical application support for these products and provides
solutions to help customers minimize downtime and reduce overall procurement
costs. Although the Company does not generally manufacture the products it
sells, it does assemble and repair certain products and systems. Most of the
Company's sales are in the maintenance and replacement markets to customers in a
wide range of industries, principally in North America.

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Applied Industrial
Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial
results of the Company's Canadian subsidiaries are included in the consolidated
financial statements based upon their fiscal year ended May 31. The Company is
considered the primary beneficiary for iSource Performance Materials, LLC
(iSource) and includes their accounts in the consolidated financial statements.
iSource has assets of $3,200 and accounts payable of $2,700 at June 30, 2005.
The Company's purchases currently account for more than 90% of iSource's sales.

Foreign Currency

The financial statements of the Company's Canadian and Mexican subsidiaries are
measured using local currencies as their functional currencies. Assets and
liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates, while
income and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
Translation gains and losses are included as components of accumulated other
comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. Transaction gains and losses
included in the statements of consolidated income were not material.

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during
the period. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in
preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Cash and Temporary Investments

The Company considers all temporary investments with maturities of three months
or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company evaluates the collectibility of trade accounts receivable based on a
combination of factors. Initially, the Company estimates an allowance for
doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt
experience. This initial estimate is adjusted based on recent trends of certain
customers and industries estimated to be a greater credit risk, trends within
the entire customer pool and changes in the overall aging of accounts
receivable. While the Company has a large customer base that is geographically
dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which
the Company operates could result in higher than expected defaults, and
therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad debts. For the years ended June
30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 the Company recorded provisions for bad debts of
approximately $1,958, $2,527 and $2,508, respectively.

Inventories

U.S. inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, using the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method, and foreign inventories are valued using the average
cost method. The Company adopted the link chain dollar value LIFO method of
accounting for domestic inventories in fiscal 1974. At June 30, 2005,
approximately half of the Company's inventory dollars relate to LIFO layers
added in the 1970's. The Company maintains five LIFO pools based on the
following product groupings: bearings, power transmission products, rubber
products, fluid power products and other products. LIFO layers and/or
liquidations are determined consistently year-to-year in a manner which is in
accordance with the guidance in the 1984 AICPA LIFO Issues Paper,
"Identification and Discussion of Certain Financial Accounting and Reporting
Issues Concerning LIFO Inventories." See Note 3 for further information
regarding inventories.

<PAGE>

      The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates
appropriate provisions related thereto. Historically, these losses have not been
significant as the vast majority of the Company's inventories are not highly
susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor
return programs.

      The Company enters into agreements with certain suppliers providing for
inventory purchase rebates. The Company's inventory purchase rebate arrangements
are unique to each supplier and are generally annual programs ending at either
the Company's fiscal year end or the supplier's year end. Rebates are received
in the form of cash or credits against purchases upon attainment of specified
purchase volumes and are received monthly, quarterly or annually based upon
actual purchases for such period. The supplier rebates are a specified
percentage of the Company's net purchases based upon achieving specific
purchasing volume levels. These percentages can increase or decrease based on
changes in the volume of purchases. The Company accrues for the receipt of these
inventory purchase rebates based upon actual cumulative purchases of inventory.
The percentage level utilized is based upon the estimated total volume of
purchases expected during the life of the program. Each supplier program is
analyzed, reviewed and reconciled each quarter as information becomes available
to determine the appropriateness of the amount estimated to be received.
Differences between estimates and actual rebates subsequently received have not
been material. All rebates under these supplier purchasing programs are
recognized under the Company's LIFO inventory accounting method as a reduction
of cost of sales when the inventories representing these purchases are sold and
recorded as cost of sales. The Company's accounting for rebates is in accordance
with guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in EITF
02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain
Consideration Received from a Vendor."

Property and Depreciation

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of buildings and
equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets. Buildings and related improvements are depreciated over ten
to thirty years and equipment over three to eight years. The carrying values of
long-lived assets, including property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment
on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the recorded value cannot be recovered from undiscounted future cash flows.
To analyze recoverability, the Company considers market values, where
available, or will project undiscounted net future cash flows over the remaining
life of such assets. If these market values or projected cash flows are less
than the carrying amount, an impairment would be recognized, resulting in a
write-down of assets with a corresponding charge to earnings. Impairment losses,
if any, are measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount and
the fair value of the assets.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair value of net
assets acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment
annually as of January 1 or whenever changes in conditions indicate carrying
value may not be recoverable. Impairment exists when the carrying value of
goodwill or other intangible assets exceeds their fair value. The results of the
Company's annual testing indicated no impairment.

      Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line
method over their estimated period of benefit.

Self-Insurance Liability

The Company maintains business insurance programs with significant self-insured
retention, which cover workers' compensation, business automobile and general
product liability claims. The Company accrues estimated losses using actuarial
calculations, models and assumptions based on historical loss experience. The
Company maintains a self-insured health benefits plan, which provides medical
benefits to employees electing coverage under the plan. The Company maintains a
reserve for incurred but not reported medical claims based on historical
experience and other assumptions. The Company utilizes independent actuarial
firms to assist in determining the adequacy of all self-insurance liability
reserves.

Revenue Recognition

Sales are recognized when products are shipped or delivered to a customer which
occurs when title is transferred to the customer. Products are billed at agreed
upon prices. The Company's experience is that collection of receivables recorded
for all sales is reasonably assured.

Shipping and Handling

The Company recognizes shipping and handling fees billed when products are
shipped or delivered to a customer, and includes such amounts in net sales.
Third party freight payments are recorded in cost of sales in the accompanying
statements of consolidated income.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are determined based upon income and expenses recorded for
financial reporting purposes. Deferred income taxes are recorded for estimated
future tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting and income tax purposes giving consideration to enacted
tax laws.

Stock Split

All share and per share data have been restated to reflect a 3-for-2 stock split
effective December 17, 2004.

Stock Based Compensation

At June 30, 2005, the Company had outstanding stock options and other
stock-based awards (see Note 9). Effective July 1, 2003, the Company adopted,
for stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs), the fair value
recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended by SFAS 148,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure," using the
modified prospective method for the transition. Under the modified prospective
method, stock-based compensation cost recognized during the fiscal year for
stock options and SARs is the same as that which would have been recognized had
the fair value recognition provisions been applied to all stock option and SAR
awards granted after July 1, 1995. Results for prior years have not been
restated. The compensation expense for stock options and SARs recorded during
the years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 was $2,111, $1,353 net of tax, or $0.04
per share and $1,586, $1,074 net of tax, or $0.03 per share, respectively. The
Company also records expense for other stock-based compensation, including
restricted stock awards, ratably over the vesting period based upon the
aggregate fair market value at the date of grant. The following table discloses
the compensation expense and net income as if the fair value based method had
been applied for stock options and SARs in each period:

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123(R) (revised 2004), "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees," which is a revision of SFAS 123, "Accounting for
Stock for Stock-Based Compensation." SFAS 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion 25
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and amends SFAS 95, "Statement of
Cash Flows." Generally, the approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to the fair value
approach described in SFAS 123. The Company will adopt SFAS 123(R) using the
modified prospective method, in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. It is expected
the effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements will not be
material.

NOTE_6: DEBT

In June 2005, the Company replaced its existing revolving credit facility with a
new five year committed revolving credit facility with a group of banks. This
agreement provides for unsecured borrowings of up to $100,000 at various
interest rate options, none of which is in excess of the banks' prime rate at
interest determination dates. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under
this facility at June 30, 2005. Fees on this facility range from .10% to .20%
per year on the average amount of the total revolving credit commitments during
the year. Unused lines under this facility, net of outstanding letters of
credit, totaled $91,500 and are available to fund future acquisitions or other
capital and operating requirements.

      During February 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with
Prudential Insurance Company, expiring in February 2007, for an uncommitted
shelf facility that enables the Company to borrow up to $100,000 in additional
long-term financing at the Company's sole discretion with terms of up to twelve
years. At June 30, 2005, there was no borrowing under this agreement.

      Long-term debt consists of:

</TABLE>

The revolving credit facility, private placement debt and senior unsecured term
notes contain restrictive covenants regarding liquidity, tangible net worth,
financial ratios and other covenants. At June 30, 2005, the most restrictive of
these covenants required that the Company have consolidated income before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization at least equal to 300% of net
interest expense. At June 30, 2005, the Company was in compliance with all
covenants. Based upon current market rates for debt of similar maturities, the
Company estimates that the fair value of its debt is greater than its carrying
value at June 30, 2005 by approximately $3,232.

      The aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt over the next five years
include $50,000 in fiscal 2008 and $25,000 in fiscal 2011.

NOTE_7: RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

The Company is exposed to market risks, primarily resulting from changes in
interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage these risks, the Company
may enter into derivative transactions pursuant to the Company's written policy.
These transactions are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 133, "Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." The Company does not hold or
issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

      During fiscal 2002 the Company entered into two interest rate swap
agreements with two domestic banks which effectively converted the fixed
interest rate on the 6.6% senior unsecured term notes to a floating variable
rate based

                                                                              27

Notes to CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued

on LIBOR. In October 2001 and August 2002, the Company terminated the swap
agreements for favorable settlements of $2,000 and $2,500, respectively. These
settlement gains are being amortized as a reduction in interest expense of
approximately $790 per year over the remaining life of the notes through
December 2007. The effect of the swap agreements was to decrease interest
expense by $790 in 2005, $791 in 2004 and $880 in 2003.

      In November 2000, the Company entered into two 10-year cross-currency swap
agreements to manage its foreign currency risk exposure on private placement
borrowings related to its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary. The cross currency
swaps effectively convert $25,000 of debt, and the associated interest payments,
from 7.98% fixed rate U.S. dollar denominated debt to 7.75% fixed rate Canadian
dollar denominated debt. The terms of the two cross-currency swaps mirror the
terms of the private placement borrowings.

      The Company has designated one of the cross-currency swaps, with a $20,000
U.S. notional amount, as a foreign currency cash flow hedge. The fair value of
the cross-currency swap was a liability of $6,022 and $2,419 at June 30, 2005
and 2004, respectively, which were recorded in current liabilities and the
related unrealized loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
(net of tax). The second cross-currency swap, however, has not been designated
as a hedging instrument under the hedge accounting provisions of SFAS 133. The
fair value of this cross-currency swap was a liability of $1,505 and $605 at
June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Changes in the fair value of this
derivative instrument are recorded in earnings as a component of other (income)
expense, net.

The exercise of non-qualified stock options during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003
resulted in $4,575, $1,353 and $466, respectively, of income tax benefits to the
Company derived from the difference between the market price at the date of
exercise and the option price. Vesting of stock awards in fiscal 2005 and 2003
resulted in $253 and $30, respectively, of incremental income tax benefits over
the amounts previously reported for financial reporting purposes. These tax
benefits were recorded in additional paid-in capital.

NOTE_9: SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

Stock Incentive Plans

The 1997 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "1997 Plan") provides for granting of
stock options, SARs, stock awards, cash awards, and such other awards or
combination thereof as the Executive Organization and Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors may determine. The number of shares of common stock which
may be awarded in each fiscal year under the 1997 Plan is two percent (2%) of
the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the first day of each
year for which the plan is in effect. Common stock available for distribution
under the 1997 Plan, but not distributed, may be carried over to the following
year. Shares available for future grants at June 30, 2005 and 2004 were 502,000
and 252,000, respectively.

      Under the 1997 Plan, the Company has awarded restricted stock, SARs and/or
stock options to officers, other key associates and members of the Board of
Directors. Restricted stock award recipients are entitled to receive dividends
on, and have voting rights with respect to their respective shares, but are
restricted from selling or transferring the shares prior to vesting. Restricted
stock awards generally vest 25% each year. The aggregate fair market value of
the restricted stock is considered unearned compensation at the time of grant
and is amortized over the vesting period or until such time as acceleration of
vesting takes place.

      At June 30, 2005, the Company had outstanding stock options and SARs
granted under the 1997 Plan. In general, the stock options and SARs vest over a
period of four years and expire after ten years. Effective July 1, 2003, the
Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation" as amended by SFAS 148, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation and Disclosure" using the modified prospective method
for transition (see Note 1). Prior to fiscal 2004, the Company accounted for

</TABLE>

At June 30, 2005, exercise prices for outstanding options and SARs ranged from
$8.77 to $28.59 per share.

Shareholders' Rights

In 1998 the Company's Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan and
declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right for each
outstanding share of Company common stock. The rights become exercisable only if
a person or group acquires beneficial ownership or commences a tender or
exchange offer for 20% or more of the Company's common stock, unless the tender
or exchange offer is for all outstanding shares of the Company upon terms
determined by the Company's continuing directors to be in the best interests of
the Company and its shareholders. When exercisable, the rights would entitle the
holders (other than the acquirer) to buy shares of the Company's common stock
having a market value equal to two times the right's exercise price or, in
certain circumstances, to buy shares of the acquiring company having a market
value equal to two times the right's exercise price.

Treasury Shares

At June 30, 2005, 894,000 shares of the Company's common stock held as treasury
shares are restricted as collateral under escrow arrangements relating to
certain change in control and director and officer indemnification agreements.

NOTE_10: BENEFIT PLANS

Retirement Savings Plan

Substantially all associates of the Company's U.S. operations participate in the
Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan. The Company makes
a discretionary profit-sharing contribution to the Retirement Savings Plan
generally based upon a percentage of the Company's domestic income before income
taxes and before the amount of the contribution (5% for 2005, 2004, and 2003).
The Company also partially matches 401(k) contributions by participants, who may
elect to contribute up to 50 percent of their compensation. The matching
contribution is made with the Company's common stock and is determined quarterly
using rates based on achieving certain quarterly earnings per share levels
(ranging from 25% to 100% of the first 6% of compensation contributed to the
plan).

      The Company's expense for contributions to the above plan was $9,947,
$6,808 and $3,990 for the years ended June 30, 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans

The Company has deferred compensation plans that enable certain associates of
the Company to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation and non-employee
directors to defer receipt of director fees. The Company funds these deferred
compensation liabilities by making contributions to rabbi trusts. Contributions
consist of Company common stock and investments in money market and mutual
funds.

Post-Employment Benefit Plans

The Company provides the following post-employment benefits:

      Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefit Plan

      The Company has a non-qualified pension plan to provide supplemental
      retirement benefits to certain officers. Benefits are payable at
      retirement based upon a percentage of the participant's compensation.

      Qualified Defined Benefit Retirement Plan

      The Company has a qualified defined benefit retirement plan that provides
      benefits to certain hourly employees at retirement. The benefits are based
      on length of service and date of retirement.

      Salary Continuation Benefits

      The Company has agreements with certain retirees to pay monthly retirement
      benefits for a period not in excess of 15 years. The discount rate used in
      determining the benefit obligation was 5.0% and 5.5% at June 30, 2005 and
      2004, respectively.

      Retiree Medical Benefits

      The Company provides health care benefits to eligible retired associates
      who elect to pay the Company a specified monthly premium. Premium payments
      are based upon current insurance rates for the type of coverage provided
      and are adjusted annually. Certain monthly health care premium payments
      are partially subsidized by the Company. Additionally, in conjunction with
      a fiscal 1998 acquisition, the Company assumed the obligation for a
      post-retirement medical benefit plan which provides health care benefits
      to eligible retired associates at no cost to the individual.

Equity securities do not include any Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.
common stock at June 30, 2005 or 2004.

      The Company has established an investment policy and regularly monitors
the performance of the assets of the trust maintained in conjunction with the
Qualified Defined Benefit Retirement Plan. The strategy implemented by the
trustee of the Qualified Defined Benefit Retirement Plan is to achieve long-term
objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with ERISA and fiduciary
standards. The long-term primary objectives are to provide for a reasonable
amount of long-term capital, without undue exposure to risk; to protect the
Qualified Defined Benefit Retirement Plan assets from erosion of purchasing
power; and to provide investment results that meet or exceed the actuarially
assumed long-term rate of return. The expected long-term rate of return on
assets assumption was developed by considering the historical returns and the
future expectations for returns of each asset class as well as the target asset
allocation of the pension portfolio.

      The Company expects to contribute $740 to its retirement benefit plans and

NOTE_11: COMMITMENTS, LEASE OBLIGATIONS AND RENT EXPENSES

The Company leases its corporate headquarters facility along with certain
service center and distribution center facilities, vehicles and equipment under
non-cancelable lease agreements accounted for as operating leases. The minimum
annual rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases are $16,900 in
2006, $12,700 in 2007, $10,000 in 2008, $7,800 in 2009, $5,400 in 2010 and
$16,200 after 2010.

      Rental expenses incurred for operating leases, principally from leases for
real property, vehicles and computer equipment were $25,500 in 2005, $26,900 in
2004, and $30,100 in 2003.

      The Company had outstanding letters of credit of $8,500 at June 30, 2005.
These letters of credit secure certain insurance obligations.

      In connection with the construction and lease of its corporate
headquarters facility, the Company has guaranteed repayment of a total of $5,678
of taxable development revenue bonds issued by Cuyahoga County and the
Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority. These bonds were issued with a 20-year
term and are scheduled to mature in March 2016. Any default, as defined in the
guarantee agreements, would obligate Applied for the full amount of the
outstanding bonds through maturity. Due to the nature of the guarantee, the
Company has not recorded any liability on the financial statements.

      The Company had a construction and lease facility under which a
distribution center and three service centers were constructed by the lessor and
leased to the Company under operating lease arrangements. At the end of the
lease term in September 2003, the Company purchased the properties for $7,500.
The residual value guarantee provisions of this lease arrangement expired with
the purchase of the properties.

      In December 2003, the Company paid the $2,990 outstanding balance of bank
debt for iSource and assumed the bank's rights under the loan agreement. Prior
to assuming the loan, the Company had guaranteed the bank debt of iSource.

      In the event of a default and subsequent payout under any or all
guarantees, the Company maintains the right to pursue all legal options
available to mitigate its exposure.

REPORT of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

                                                                 [DELOITTE LOGO]

      To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Applied Industrial
      Technologies, Inc.

      We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Applied
      Industrial Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June
      30, 2005 and 2004, and the related statements of consolidated income,
      shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
      period ended June 30, 2005. These financial statements are the
      responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
      express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

            We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
      Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
      require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
      about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
      An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
      amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
      includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
      estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
      statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
      basis for our opinion.

            In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
      fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Applied
      Industrial Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries at June 30, 2005 and 2004,
      and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
      three years in the period ended June 30, 2005, in conformity with
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

            As discussed in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial
      statements, effective July 1, 2003, the Company changed its method of
      accounting for stock-based compensation to conform to Statement of
      Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation."

            We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
      Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of
      the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30,
      2005, based on the criteria established in Internal Control -- Integrated
      Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
      Treadway Commission and our report dated August 19, 2005 expressed an
      unqualified opinion on management's assessment of the effectiveness of the
      Company's internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified
      opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
      financial reporting.

transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of the Company's Management and Board of
Directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's
assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial
statements.

      Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to the
preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements and may
not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions,
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.

      Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005. This evaluation
was based on the criteria set forth in the framework Internal Control -
Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, Management determined that
the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June
30, 2005.

      Management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005 has been audited by
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein.

REPORT of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Applied Industrial Technologies,
Inc.

We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Applied
Industrial Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, based
on criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

      We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

      A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and
effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

      Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial
reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of
the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

      In our opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of June 30, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

      We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance
sheet and the related statements of consolidated income, shareholders' equity
and cash flows as of and for the year ended June 30, 2005 of the Company and our
report dated August 19, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements.

(A) Cost of sales for interim financial statements are computed using estimated
gross profit percentages which are adjusted throughout the year based upon
available information. Adjustments to actual cost are primarily made based upon
the annual physical inventory and the effect of year-end inventory quantities on
LIFO costs. Fourth quarter adjustments in 2005, 2004 and 2003 increased gross
profit by $1,612, $3,283 and $4,410; net income by $981, $2,131 and $2,682 and
diluted net income per share by $0.03, $0.07, and $0.09 respectively. While
there were no LIFO layer liquidations for the year ended June 30, 2005,
reductions in year-end inventories during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2004
and 2003 resulted in liquidations of LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower
costs prevailing in prior years. The effect of these liquidations for the years
ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 increased gross profit by $672 and $741, net income
by $420 and $453 and net income per share by $0.01 and $0.01, respectively.

(B) Effective July 1, 2003, the Company adopted for stock options and SARs the
fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," using the modified prospective method for the transition. Under
the modified prospective method, stock based compensation cost recognized during
this fiscal year for stock options and SARs is the same as that which would have
been recognized had the fair value recognition provisions been applied to all
awards granted after July 1, 1995. During the years ended June 30, 2005 and
2004, compensation expense recorded for stock options and SARs compensation was
$2,111 and $1,586, ($1,353 and $1,074 net of tax) or $0.04 and $0.03 per share
respectively.

(C) On August 15, 2005 there were 6,043 shareholders of record including 3,615
shareholders in the Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. Retirement Savings
Plan. The Company's common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The
closing price on August 15, 2005 was $35.72 per share.

(D) All per share data have been restated to reflect a 3-for-2 stock split
effective December 17, 2004.
