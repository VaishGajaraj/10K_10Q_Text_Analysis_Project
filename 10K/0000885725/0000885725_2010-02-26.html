</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Boston Scientific Corporation is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical
devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties including
 cardiac rhythm management,  electrophysiology, interventional cardiology, peripheral interventions,
neurovascular, endoscopy, urology, women&#146;s health and neuromodulation. Our mission is to improve
the quality of patient care and the productivity of health care delivery through the development
and advocacy of less-invasive medical devices and procedures. This is accomplished through the
continuing refinement of existing products and procedures and the investigation and development of
new technologies that can reduce risk, trauma, cost, procedure time and the need for aftercare.
When used in this report, the terms &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;our&#148; and &#147;the Company&#148; mean Boston Scientific
Corporation and its divisions and subsidiaries.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our history began in the late 1960s when our co-founder, John Abele, acquired an equity interest in
Medi-tech, Inc., a research and development company focused on developing alternatives to surgery.
In 1969, Medi-tech introduced a family of steerable catheters used in some of the first
less-invasive procedures performed. In 1979, John Abele joined with Pete Nicholas to form Boston
Scientific Corporation, which indirectly acquired Medi-tech. This acquisition began a period of
active and focused marketing, new product development and organizational growth. Since then, we
have advanced the practice of less-invasive medicine by helping physicians and other medical
professionals treat a variety of diseases and improve patients&#146; quality of life by providing
alternatives to surgery and other medical procedures that are typically traumatic to the body. Some
of the uses of our products include: enlarging narrowed blood vessels to prevent heart attack and
stroke; clearing passages blocked by plaque to restore blood flow; detecting and managing fast,
slow or irregular heart rhythms; mapping electrical problems in the heart; performing biopsies and
intravascular ultrasounds; placing filters to prevent blood clots from reaching the lungs, heart or
brain; treating urological, gynecological, renal, pulmonary, neurovascular and gastrointestinal
diseases; and modulating nerve activity to treat chronic pain.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our net sales have increased substantially over the last thirty years, growing from $2&nbsp;million in
1979 to approximately $8.2&nbsp;billion in 2009. Our growth has been fueled in part by strategic
acquisitions and alliances designed to improve our ability to take advantage of growth
opportunities in the medical device industry. On April&nbsp;21, 2006, we consummated our acquisition of
Guidant Corporation. With this acquisition, we became a major provider in the worldwide cardiac
rhythm management (CRM)&nbsp;market, enhancing our overall competitive position and long-term growth
potential and further diversifying our product portfolio. This acquisition has established us as
one of the world&#146;s largest cardiovascular device companies and a global leader in microelectronic
therapies. This and other strategic acquisitions have helped us to add promising new technologies
to our pipeline and to offer one of the broadest product portfolios in the world for use in
less-invasive procedures. We believe that the depth and breadth of our product portfolio has also
enabled us to compete more effectively in, and better absorb the pressures of, the current
healthcare environment of cost containment, managed care, large buying groups, government
contracting and hospital consolidation and will generally assist us in navigating the current
turmoil in the global economic markets and potential U.S. healthcare reform measures.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our FilterWire EZ&#153; Embolic Protection System is a low profile filter designed to capture embolic
material that may become dislodged during a procedure, which could otherwise travel into the
microvasculature where it could cause a heart attack or stroke. It is commercially available in the
U.S., our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries for multiple indications, including the
treatment of disease in peripheral, coronary and carotid vessels. It is also available in the U.S.
for the treatment of saphenous vein grafts and carotid artery stenting procedures.</DIV>

used for the management of chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs. This system delivers
pain management by applying an electrical signal to mask pain signals traveling from the spinal
cord to the brain. The Precision System utilizes a rechargeable battery and features a programming
system. We believe that we continue to have a technology advantage over our competitors with
proprietary features such as Multiple Independent Current Control, which is intended to allow the
physician to target specific areas of pain more precisely. As a demonstration of our commitment to
strengthening clinical evidence with spinal cord stimulation, we are initiating a trial to assess
the therapeutic effectiveness and cost effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation compared to
reoperation in patients with failed back surgery syndrome. We believe that this trial could result
in consideration of spinal cord stimulation much earlier in the continuum of care. Further, we
expect to launch two new lead products during 2010, which we believe will provide us with continued
growth in our Neuromodulation business.

consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers. Each of our
business groups maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focusing on physicians who
specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions. We believe that this
focused disease state management enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales
representatives and to foster collaborative relationships with physicians. We believe that we have
positive working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry, which enable us
to gain a detailed understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond
quickly to the changing needs of physicians and their patients.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2009, we sold our products to over 10,000 hospitals, clinics, outpatient facilities and medical
offices. We are not dependent on any single institution and no single institution accounted for
more than ten percent of our net sales in 2009, 2008, or 2007. However, large group purchasing organizations,
hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and
represent a substantial portion of our U.S. net sales.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">International net sales accounted for approximately 43&nbsp;percent of our net sales in 2009. Net sales
and operating income attributable to our 2009 geographic regions are presented in <I>Note P&#151;Segment
Reporting </I>to our consolidated financial statements included in Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report. During
the first quarter of 2009, we reorganized our international structure to provide more direct sales
focus in the marketplace and operate through three international business units, in addition to our
U.S. operating segment: EMEA, consisting of Europe, the Middle East and Africa; Japan; and
Inter-Continental, consisting of Asia Pacific and the Americas. We have reclassified previously
reported segment results to be consistent with the 2009 presentation,
contained in <I>Results of
Operations</I> and <I>Note P</I>. In 2010, we will further restructure our international business into the
following business units, in addition to our U.S. operating segment: Europe, Japan, and Emerging
Markets, in order to be more effective in executing our business strategy. Maintaining and
expanding our international presence is an important component of our long-term growth plan.
Through our international presence, we seek to increase net sales and market share, leverage our
relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs, accelerate the time to
bring new products to market, and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can
implement across our product lines.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have five international manufacturing facilities in Ireland, two in Costa Rica and one in Puerto
Rico. Approximately 50&nbsp;percent of our products sold worldwide during 2009 were manufactured at
these facilities. In early 2009, we announced our Plant Network Optimization program designed to
simplify our plant network, reduce our manufacturing costs and improve gross margins. In connection
with this program, we expect to rationalize two of our international manufacturing plants by the
end of 2011. Additionally, we maintain international research and development capabilities in
Ireland and Miyazaki, Japan, as well as physician training centers in Paris, France and Tokyo,
Japan.</DIV>

teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality. We
continue to focus on examining our operations and general business activities to identify
cost-improvement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectiveness. Our Plant Network
Optimization program calls for reducing the number of our manufacturing plants from 17 to 12, and
relocating approximately 15&nbsp;percent of our current value of production to different facilities. We
estimate that the program, combined with activities under our 2007
Restructuring plan, discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report,   will result
in annual reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $100&nbsp;million to $120&nbsp;million in 2012.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We design and manufacture the majority of our products in technology centers around the world. Many
components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available
raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources. Certain items are
custom made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity exists at
our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a
reasonable period of time. We also have an on-going program to identify single-source components
and to develop alternative back-up supplies. However, in certain cases, we may not be able to
quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for specific materials, components or
products, largely due to the regulatory approval system and the complex nature of our manufacturing
processes and those of our suppliers. A reduction or interruption in supply, an inability to
develop and validate alternative sources if required, or a significant increase in the price of raw
materials, components or products could adversely affect our operations and financial condition,
particularly materials or components related to our CRM products and drug-eluting stent systems. In
addition, our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal
resources and third party vendors to perform this service. To the extent our sterilizers
are unable to process our products, whether due to raw material, capacity, regulatory or other
constraints, we may be unable to transition to other providers in a timely manner, which could have
an adverse impact on our operations.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Certain products are manufactured for us by third parties. We are currently reliant on Abbott
Laboratories for our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems in the U.S. and Japan. Our supply
agreement with Abbott for everolimus-eluting stent systems in these regions extends through the end
of the second quarter of 2012. At present, we believe that our supply of everolimus-eluting stent
systems from Abbott and our current launch plans for our next-generation internally-manufactured
everolimus-eluting stent system in these regions is sufficient to meet customer demand. However,
any production or capacity issues that affect Abbott&#146;s manufacturing capabilities or our process
for forecasting, ordering and receiving shipments may impact the ability to increase or decrease
our level of supply in a timely manner; therefore, our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems
supplied to us by Abbott may not align with customer demand, which could have an adverse effect on
our operating results. We launched our internally developed and manufactured next-generation
everolimus-eluting stent system, our PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; stent system, in our EMEA region and certain
Inter-Continental countries in the fourth quarter of 2009, and expect to launch this product in the
U.S. and Japan in mid-2012.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In January&nbsp;2006, legacy Boston Scientific received a corporate warning letter from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)&nbsp;notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three of our
facilities and advising us that our corporate-wide corrective action plan relating to three
site-specific warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. During 2008, the FDA reinspected
a number of our facilities and, in October&nbsp;2008, informed us that our quality system is now in
substantial compliance with its Quality System Regulations. The FDA has approved all of our
requests for final approval of Class&nbsp;III product submissions previously on hold due to the
corporate warning letter and is processing all requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments. In
November of 2009 and January of 2010, the FDA reinspected two official action-indicated Boston
Scientific sites to follow-up on observations from the 2008 FDA inspections. Both of these FDA
inspections confirmed that all issues at the sites have been resolved and all</DIV>

letter remains in place pending FDA internal administrative procedures.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, during the first quarter of 2009, we acquired a third-party sterilization facility
which was subject to a warning letter from the FDA. The FDA had requested documentation and
explanations regarding various corrective actions related to the facility. This information was
provided to the FDA and the FDA has since re-inspected the facility, issuing no observations, and
subsequently removed all restrictions related to the warning letter.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are committed to providing high quality products to our customers. To meet this commitment, we
have implemented updated quality systems and concepts throughout our organization. Our quality
system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the
product, component specification process and the manufacturing, sales and servicing of the product.
Our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous
improvement concepts throughout the product life. These systems are designed to enable us to
satisfy the various international quality system regulations, including those of the FDA with
respect to products sold in the U.S. All of our manufacturing facilities, including our U.S. and
European distribution centers, are certified under the ISO13485:2003 quality system standard for
medical devices, which requires, among other items, an implemented quality system that applies to
component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations. This
certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a company&#146;s quality system by an
independent outside auditor. Maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities
undergo periodic re-examination.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, we maintain an on-going initiative to seek ISO14001 certification at our plants around
the world. ISO14001 is a globally recognized standard for Environmental Management Systems,
established by the International Standards Organization, which provides a voluntary framework to
identify key environmental aspects associated with our business. We engage in continuous
environmental performance improvement around these aspects. At present, nine of our manufacturing
and distribution facilities have attained ISO14001 certification. We are committed to achieving
ISO14001 certification at all of our manufacturing and distribution centers worldwide.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell
our products from various companies, some of which may have greater financial and marketing
resources than we do. Our primary competitors include Johnson &#038; Johnson (including its subsidiary,
Cordis Corporation); Medtronic, Inc.; Abbott Laboratories and St. Jude Medical, Inc.; as well as a
wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products
or participate in only a specific market segment. We also face competition from non-medical device
companies, such as pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease
states intended to be treated using our products.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We believe that our products compete primarily on their ability to safely and effectively perform
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in a less-invasive manner, including clinical outcomes, ease
of use, comparative effectiveness, reliability and physician familiarity. In the current
environment of managed care, economically-motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare
providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly
required to compete on the basis of price, value, reliability and efficiency. We believe the
current global economic conditions and potential U.S. healthcare reform measures could put
additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure
rates and market sizes. We recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our
ability to offer products with differentiated clinical outcomes, create or acquire innovative,

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Regulatory Environment</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory
bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require
manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the
development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices.
Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of
which requires that a clinical evaluation be conducted before a device receives approval for
commercial distribution.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the U.S., permission to distribute a new device generally can be met in one of three ways. The
first process requires that a pre-market notification (510(k) Submission) be made to the FDA to
demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally
marketed device that is not subject to pre-market approval (PMA), i.e., the &#147;predicate&#148; device. An
appropriate predicate device for a pre-market notification is one that (i)&nbsp;was legally marketed
prior to May&nbsp;28, 1976, (ii)&nbsp;was approved under a PMA but then subsequently reclassified from
class III to class II or I, or (iii)&nbsp;has been found to be substantially equivalent and cleared for
commercial distribution under a 510(k) Submission. Applicants must submit descriptive data and,
when necessary, performance data to establish that the device is substantially equivalent to a
predicate device. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in
support of a 510(k) Submission. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to
the applicable Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)&nbsp;regulations. The FDA must issue an order
finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to existing
devices covered by a 510(k) Submission that do not raise new questions of safety or effectiveness
can generally be made without additional 510(k) Submissions. More significant changes, such as new
designs or materials, may require a separate 510(k) with data to support that the modified device
remains substantially equivalent. The FDA has recently begun to review its clearance process in an
effort to make it more rigorous, which may require additional clinical data, time and effort for
product clearance.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The second process requires the submission of an application for PMA to the FDA to demonstrate that
the device is safe and effective for its intended use as manufactured. This approval process
applies to certain class III devices. In this case, two steps of FDA approval are generally
required before marketing in the U.S. can begin. First, we must comply with the applicable IDE
regulations in connection with any human clinical investigation of the device in the U.S. Second,
the FDA must review our PMA application, which contains, among other things, clinical information
acquired under the IDE. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a
reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The third process requires that an application for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE)&nbsp;be made to
the FDA for the use of a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD). A HUD is intended to benefit patients by
treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects, or is manifested in, fewer than 4,000
individuals in the U.S. per year. The application submitted to the FDA for an HDE is similar in
both form and content to a PMA application, but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a
PMA. This approval process demonstrates that there is no comparable device available to treat or
diagnose the condition, the device will not expose patients to unreasonable or significant risk,
and the benefits to health from use outweigh the risks. The HUD provision of the regulation
provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of
diseases affecting smaller patient populations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The FDA can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices;
order repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of health
professionals and

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the
public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain certain violations of the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for
criminal prosecution of such violations. International sales of medical devices manufactured in the
U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from
lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices are subject
to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do
not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated.
Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in
the U.S. to take advantage of differing regulatory requirements. Most countries outside of the U.S.
require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The
recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or
standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance.
Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the European Union, we are required to comply with the Medical Devices Directive and obtain CE
Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE Mark certification, granted following
approval from an independent notified body, is an international symbol of adherence to quality
assurance standards and compliance with applicable European Medical Devices Directives. We are also
required to comply with other foreign regulations such as the requirement that we obtain approval
from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW)&nbsp;before we can launch new products in
Japan. The time required to obtain these foreign approvals to market our products may vary from
U.S. approvals, and requirements for these approvals may differ from those required by the FDA.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are also subject to various environmental laws, directives and regulations both in the U.S. and
abroad. Our operations, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances
regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We do
not believe that compliance with environmental laws will have a material impact on our capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, given the scope and nature of these laws,
there can be no assurance that environmental laws will not have a material impact on our results of
operations. We assess potential environmental contingent liabilities on a regular basis. At
present, we are not aware of any such liabilities that would have a material impact on our
business.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We believe that sound environmental, health and safety performance contributes to our competitive
strength while benefiting our customers, shareholders and employees. We are committed to continuous
improvement in these areas by reducing pollution, the depletion of natural resources, and our
overall environmental footprint. Specifically, we are working to optimize energy and resource
usage, ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste. We are certified to the FTSE4 Good
Corporate Social Responsibility Index, managed by The Financial Times and the London Stock
Exchange, which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of
corporate responsibility. This certification recognizes our dedication to those standards, and it
places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business
practices and sound environmental policies.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We maintain a global Government Affairs presence in Washington D.C. to actively monitor and
influence a myriad of legislative and administrative policies impacting us, both on a domestic and
an international front. The Government Affairs office works closely with members of Congress, key
Congressional committee staff and White House and Administration staff, which facilitates our
active engagement on issues affecting our business. Our proactive approach and depth of political

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers
around the world that typically bill various third-party payors, including governmental programs
(e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care programs, for the
healthcare services provided to their patients. Third-party payors may provide or deny coverage for
certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment
criteria. Reimbursement by third-party payors for these services is based on a wide range of
methodologies that may reflect the services&#146; assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and
economic value. These reimbursement methodologies confer different, and sometimes conflicting,
levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients, and these
methodologies are subject to frequent refinements. Third-party payors are also increasingly
adjusting reimbursement rates, often downwards, and challenging the prices charged for medical
products and services. There can be no assurance that our products will be covered automatically by
third-party payors, that reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the third-party
payors&#146; coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, are also underway
in many countries in which we do business. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and
healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., Japan, Europe and other international
markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products
and may influence a physician&#146;s selection of products used to treat patients. Spending on healthcare in some countries, including the U.S., may also be affected by the global economic slowdown.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Proprietary Rights and Patent Litigation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements to
protect our intellectual property. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and foreign
countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of December
31, 2009, we held more than 15,000 patents, and had approximately 10,000 patent applications
pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology. In addition, we hold exclusive and
non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent
applications. There can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in the
issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or
circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad
to protect our technology or to provide us with a competitive advantage.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other
parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There can be no
assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any
breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third
parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in
the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which we compete. We have defended, and
will continue to defend, ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the
patent rights of others. Adverse determinations in any patent litigation could subject us to
significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties, and, if
licenses are not available, prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using certain of our
products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we may find it
necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or
know-how and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Patent
litigation can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that our

favorable to us. Accordingly, we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation,
particularly to manage risk over time. Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that
are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve
monetary payments to or from third parties.

litigation and proceedings in which we are involved. In management&#146;s opinion, we are not currently
involved in any legal proceeding other than those specifically identified in <I>Note L, </I>which,
individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on our financial condition, results
of operations and liquidity.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The testing, marketing and sale of human healthcare products entails an inherent risk of product
liability claims. In the normal course of business, product liability and securities claims are
asserted against us. Product liability and securities claims may be asserted against us in the
future related to events unknown at the present time. We are substantially self-insured with
respect to product liability and intellectual property infringement claims. We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage
against securities claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our
potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. Product liability claims, product
recalls, securities litigation and other litigation in the future, regardless of outcome, could
have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that our risk management practices,
including limited insurance coverage, are reasonably adequate to protect against anticipated
product liability and securities litigation losses. However, unanticipated catastrophic losses
could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and
liquidity.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Employees</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had approximately 26,000 employees, including approximately 14,000 in
operations; 6,000 in selling, marketing and distribution; 4,000 in clinical, regulatory and
research and development; and 2,000 in administration. Of these employees, we employed
approximately 10,000 outside the U.S., approximately 6,000 of whom are in the operations function.
We believe that the continued success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to
attract and retain qualified personnel.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Community Outreach</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are committed to making more possible in the communities where we work and live. We bring this
commitment to life by supporting health, education and research initiatives on a global, national
and local basis. Through the Boston Scientific Foundation, we fund non-profit organizations in our
local communities and medical education fellowships at institutions throughout the United States.
Our community grants support programs aimed at improving the lives of those with unmet needs by
engaging in partnerships that promote long-term, systemic change. The Foundation is committed to
funding organizations focused on increasing access to quality health care and improving educational
opportunities, particularly with regards to math, science, engineering and technology. A prominent
example of our ongoing commitment to patients is the Close the Gap program, which addresses
disparities in cardiovascular care for the underserved patient populations of women, black
Americans, and Latino Americans. Close the Gap increases awareness of cardiovascular risk factors,
teaches health care providers about cultural beliefs and barriers to treatment, and advocates for
measures that help ensure all patients receive the cardiovascular care they need.

pricing pressure, especially in the U.S. market. We estimate that the average selling price of our
drug-eluting stent systems in the U.S. decreased approximately eight percent in 2009, as compared
to the prior year. Further, recently published data from a single-center, non-double blinded,
underpowered study sponsored by one of our competitors have negatively affected, and may continue
to have a negative impact on, physician and patient confidence in our technology and net sales of
our TAXUS&#174; paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent systems. In addition, perceptions of excessive use of
drug-eluting stent systems based on evidence from a third-party clinical trial comparing
drug-eluting stent systems to pharmaceuticals may have an adverse impact on our net sales of
drug-eluting stent systems. We expect to launch our next-generation TAXUS&#174; Element<FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#212;</FONT> stent
system in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries during the first half of 2010, in
the U.S. mid-2011 and Japan in late 2011 or early 2012. A delay in the timing of the launch of
next-generation products may result in a further decline in our market share and have an adverse

production or capacity issues that affect Abbott&#146;s manufacturing capabilities or our process for
forecasting, ordering and receiving shipments may impact our ability to increase or decrease the
level of supply to us in a timely manner; therefore, our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems
supplied to us by Abbott may not align with customer demand. We expect to launch our internally
developed and manufactured next-generation everolimus-eluting stent system, the PROMUS&#174; Element&#153;

for the PROMUS&#174; stent system from Abbott extends through the end of the second quarter of 2012 in
the U.S. and Japan. Our inability to obtain regulatory approval and timely launch our PROMUS&#174;

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Worldwide CRM market growth rates in recent years, including the U.S. ICD market, have been below
those experienced in prior years, resulting primarily from industry field actions and from a lack
of new indications for use. There can be no assurance that the size of the CRM market will
increase above existing levels or that we will be able to increase CRM market share or increase net
sales in a timely manner, if at all. Our U.S. ICD sales represented approximately 50&nbsp;percent of our
worldwide CRM net sales in 2009, and any changes in this market could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition. Additionally, average selling prices have declined in the past
year due, in part, to competitive pressures and general economic conditions. Further, recent
disciplinary actions we have taken against certain of our U.S. CRM sales personnel, as well as attrition
beyond those subject to disciplinary actions, could result in lost U.S. CRM net sales. Net sales
from our CRM group represented approximately 31&nbsp;percent of our consolidated net sales in 2009.
Therefore, further decreases in net sales and average selling prices of our CRM products could have
a significant impact on our results of operations. In addition, our inability to increase our
worldwide CRM net sales could result in future goodwill and other intangible asset impairment
charges. We expect to launch our next-generation line of defibrillators in 2010 and a new
wireless pacemaker in the U.S. and Europe in early 2011. Variability in the timing of the launch
of next-generation products may result in excess or expired inventory positions and future
inventory charges, which may adversely impact our results from operations.

of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott, including any improvements or
iterations approved for sale during the term of the applicable supply arrangements and of the type
that could be approved by a supplement to an approved FDA pre-market
approval, are significantly
lower than that of our TAXUS&#174; stent system. Therefore, if sales of everolimus-eluting stent
systems supplied to us by Abbott continue to increase in relation to our total drug-eluting stent
system sales, our profit margins will continue to decrease. Further, the price we pay for our
supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott is determined by our contracts
with them. Our cost is based, in part, on previously fixed estimates of Abbott&#146;s manufacturing
costs for everolimus-eluting stent systems and third-party reports of our average selling price of
these stent systems. Amounts paid pursuant to this pricing arrangement are subject to a retroactive
adjustment approximately every two years based on Abbott&#146;s actual costs to manufacture these stent
systems for us and our average selling price of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by
Abbott. Pursuant to these adjustments, we may make a payment to Abbott based on the differences
between their actual manufacturing costs and the contractually stipulated manufacturing costs and
differences between our actual average selling price and third-party reports of our average selling
price, in each case, with respect to our purchases of everolimus-eluting stent systems from Abbott.
As a result, our profit margins in the years in which we record payments related to purchases of
everolimus-eluting stent systems from Abbott may decrease.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We had total debt of $5.918&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, attributable in large part to our 2006
acquisition of Guidant Corporation, of which $1.750&nbsp;billion, as
well as our revolving credit facility,  will mature in 2011. We expect to
refinance the majority of our 2011 debt maturities and revolving credit facility by
mid-2010. Although Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s Ratings Services recently upgraded our credit rating to BBB-,
an investment grade rating, our current credit rating from Fitch Ratings is BB&#043;, and from Moody&#146;s
Investor Service is Ba1, both of which are below investment grade. Our inability to regain
investment grade credit ratings could impact our ability to obtain financing on terms reasonably
acceptable to us, and increase the cost of borrowing funds in the future. If we are unable to
refinance this indebtedness on satisfactory terms, we may be required to dedicate a more
substantial portion of our operating cash flows to our indebtedness, which may limit our
flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or investing in our growth.
In addition, our revolving credit facility agreement contains financial covenants that require us
to maintain specified financial ratios. If we are unable to satisfy these covenants, we may be
required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made that our lenders would
grant such waivers on favorable terms or at all, and we could be required to repay any borrowings
under this facility on demand. Our revolving credit facility matures in 2011.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We test our April 1 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more
frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist.  We
assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and, in evaluating the potential for impairment
of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future expected cash flows,
terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. While we do not believe there are indicators
of impairment as of December 31, 2009 to necessitate the performance of an interim impairment test, we
have considered current and future expected economic conditions as of year end and, as a result, we have
identified two reporting units with a material amount of goodwill that are at higher risk of potential
failure of the first step of the impairment test in future reporting
periods. </div>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the
fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary
from actual results.  We have allocated a significant portion of the goodwill associated with our 2006
acquisition of Guidant Corporation to our U.S. CRM and EMEA reporting units. Changes in the fair value
of these reporting units could make it reasonably likely that an impairment may occur over the next
twelve months in these reporting units. Future goodwill impairment charges could materially adversely

by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. These
authorities have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry. We have received subpoenas and
other requests for information from Congress and other state and federal governmental agencies,
including, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Office of Inspector General of
the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Defense. These
investigations relate primarily to financial arrangements with health care providers, regulatory
compliance and product promotional practices. We are cooperating with these investigations and are
responding to these requests.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, we recently entered into a civil settlement with the DOJ regarding the Department&#146;s
investigation relating to certain post-market surveys conducted by Guidant Corporation before we
acquired Guidant in 2006. As part of the settlement, we entered into a Corporate Integrity
Agreement (CIA)&nbsp;with the Office of Inspector General for HHS. The CIA requires enhancements to
certain compliance procedures related to financial arrangements with
health care providers.
The obligations imposed upon us by the CIA and cooperation with ongoing investigations will involve
human resources costs and diversion of management and employee focus. Cooperation typically also
involves document production costs. We cannot predict when the investigations will be resolved, the
outcome of these investigations or their impact on us. An adverse outcome in one or more of these
investigations could include the commencement of civil and criminal
proceedings; substantial fines,
penalties and administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs
and entry into additional CIAs or an amendment to the existing CIA. In addition, resolution of any
of these matters could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations,
including entering into additional CIAs. We may incur greater future
costs to fulfill the obligations imposed upon us by the CIA. Furthermore, the CIA, and if any of
the ongoing investigations continue over a long period of time, could further divert the attention
of management from the day-to-day operations of our business and impose significant additional
administrative burdens on us. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from
these investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations and liquidity.

are considering legislation restricting our interactions with health care providers and requiring
disclosure of payments to them, compliance with which will require significant human resource and
financial costs as well as complex information technology systems. The Federal government has
introduced similar legislation, which may or may not preempt state laws. We are devoting
substantial time and financial resources in order to develop and implement enhanced structure,
policies, systems and processes in order to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements.
Recent Supreme Court case law has clarified that the FDA&#146;s authority over medical devices preempts
state tort laws, but legislation has been introduced at the Federal level to allow state
intervention, which could lead to increased and inconsistent regulation at the state level. We
anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that we will be
subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the future.

severely diminished liquidity and credit availability. There can be no assurance that there will
not be further deterioration in the global economy, and these conditions may adversely affect our

or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or
decision to purchase our products, particularly capital equipment, or to pay for our products they
do purchase on a timely basis, if at all. The strength and timing of any economic recovery remains
uncertain, and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic slowdown may negatively impact
our average selling prices, our net sales and profit margins, procedural volumes and reimbursement
rates from third party payors. In addition, the current economic conditions may adversely affect
our suppliers leading them to experience financial difficulties or to be unable to borrow money to

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. Physician
customers, particularly in interventional cardiology, have historically moved quickly to new
products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and
trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. However,
intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. Furthermore, appellate
courts can overturn lower court patent decisions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across
product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties.
In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related
proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently
drive settlement not only of individual cases, but also of a series of pending and potentially
related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically
sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial
court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are
difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in
other geographies.

ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature
of our technologies. We rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations,
strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive
position. We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the U.S. and abroad
for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and attempt to review third-party patents
and patent applications to the extent publicly available in order to develop an effective patent
strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor
the patent claims of others. We currently own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and have numerous
patent applications pending. We also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which
patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash, cross-licensing rights or
royalty payments. No assurance can be made that any pending or future patent applications will
result in the issuance of patents, that any current or future patents issued to, or licensed by, us
will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors, or that our patents will not be found
invalid. In addition, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents, trade
secrets or know-how or to assert them against claimed infringement by others. Any legal action of
that type could be costly and time consuming and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be
successful. We are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent
infringement and other intellectual property-related actions.

our operating margins, financial position, results of operation or liquidity. Pending or future
patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can
prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and
management personnel. In the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully
challenged, we may be required to obtain a license on terms which may not be favorable to us, if at

cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant. Further, we are substantially
self-insured with respect to product liability and intellectual
property infringement claims. We maintain insurance policies providing
limited coverage against securities claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance
coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Product

Cordis Corporation); Medtronic, Inc.; Abbott Laboratories; and St. Jude Medical, Inc. In addition,
we face competition from a wide range of companies that sell a single or a limited number of
competitive products or which participate in only a specific market segment, as well as from
non-medical device companies, including pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative
therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our products.

reimbursement levels and healthcare costs; and international markets may also be impacted
by foreign government efforts to understand healthcare practices and pricing in other countries,
which could result in increased pricing transparency across geographies and pressure to
harmonize reimbursement and ultimately reduce the selling prices of our products. The trend in
countries around the world, including Japan, toward more stringent regulatory requirements for
product clearance, changing reimbursement models and more rigorous inspection and enforcement
activities has generally caused or may cause medical device manufacturers to experience more
uncertainty, delay, risk and expense. In addition, most international jurisdictions have adopted
regulatory approval and periodic renewal requirements for medical devices, and we must comply with
these requirements in order to market our products in these jurisdictions. Any significant changes
in the competitive, political, legal, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we
conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers
around the world that typically bill various third-party payors, including governmental programs
(e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care programs, for the
healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate
reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental third-party payors is
critical to the success of medical technology companies. The availability of reimbursement affects
which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies from
country to country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and services. After
we develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement
approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors. Further legislative or
administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the U.S., Japan, or other international
countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical
devices or denies coverage for those procedures, including price regulation, competitive pricing,
coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and
managed-care arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Major third-party payors for hospital services in the U.S. and abroad continue to work to contain
healthcare costs. The introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of
healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased
discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed and has shifted
services between inpatient and outpatient settings. Initiatives to limit the increase of healthcare
costs, including price regulation, are also underway in several countries in which we do business.
Hospitals or physicians may respond to these cost-containment pressures by substituting lower cost
products or other therapies for our products. In connection with Guidant&#146;s product recalls, certain
third-party payors have sought, and others may seek, recourse against us for amounts previously
reimbursed.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and
reforms by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a
consolidation trend in the healthcare industry, including hospitals. This in turn has resulted in
greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as
group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to
consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our hospital customers. We expect that market demand,
government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and
societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further
business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors, which may reduce
competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our
business, financial condition or results of operations.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and
various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax
authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We
regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of
our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes
of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our net
income or financial condition. Additionally, changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially
impact our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax
reform, such as the recent proposal by the Obama administration, if enacted, could have a
significant adverse impact on our future results of operations. In particular, Congressional
leadership has proposed an annual fee on medical device manufacturers. This proposal would require
medical device companies to pay additional taxes of up to
$2&nbsp;billion each year, beginning in 2011. President Obama&#146;s
recent proposal includes an excise tax in the same amount, starting in 2013, which would be administrated by the IRS.

 A fee or excise tax, if
passed, could result in a significant increase in the tax burden on the medical device industry,
which could have a material, negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows.</DIV>

our ability to sterilize our products could adversely impact our production efforts and could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We vertically integrate operations where integration provides significant cost, supply or quality
benefits. However, we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our
products, some of which are custom made. Certain supplies are purchased from single-sources due to
quality considerations, expertise, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. We
may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for certain components, materials
or products in a timely manner largely due to the complex nature of our and many of our suppliers&#146;
manufacturing processes. Production issues, including capacity constraint; quality issues affecting
us or our suppliers; an inability to develop and validate alternative sources if required; or a
significant increase in the price of materials or components could adversely affect our operations
and financial condition.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, our products require sterilization prior to sale and we rely on a mix of internal
resources and third party vendors to perform this service. To the extent our sterilizers

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes contained in Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Introduction</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Boston Scientific Corporation is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical
devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. Our business strategy
is to lead global markets for less-invasive medical devices by developing and marketing innovative
products, services and therapies that address unmet patient needs, provide superior
clinical outcomes and demonstrate compelling value.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the first quarter of 2008, we completed the divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses. Our
operating results for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 include a full year of results of these
businesses. Our operating results for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 include the results of these
businesses through the date of separation. We are involved in several post-closing separation
activities through transition service agreements, some from which we continued to generate net
sales during 2009. Many of these transition service agreements expired throughout 2009 and the
remainder will be completed during the first half of 2010. Refer to the <I>Restructuring Initiatives</I>
section and <I>Note F &#151; Divestitures </I>to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item&nbsp;8 of
this Annual Report for a description of these business divestitures.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Executive Summary</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>Financial Highlights and Trends</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our net sales in 2009 were $8.188&nbsp;billion, which included net sales from divested businesses of $11
million, as compared to net sales of $8.050&nbsp;billion in 2008, which included net sales from divested
business of $69&nbsp;million, an increase of $138&nbsp;million, or two percent. Foreign currency fluctuations
decreased our net sales by $92&nbsp;million in 2009, as compared to 2008. Excluding the impact of
foreign currency and net sales from divested businesses, our net sales increased $288&nbsp;million, or
four percent, as compared to the prior year.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Worldwide net sales in our cardiac rhythm management (CRM)&nbsp;group increased $123&nbsp;million, or five
percent in 2009, as compared to 2008. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, our
worldwide CRM group net sales increased seven percent. This increase was driven by the continued
success of our next-generation COGNIS&#174; cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) and
our TELIGEN&#174; implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)&nbsp;systems, launched in the U.S., our
Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA)&nbsp;region and certain Inter-Continental countries in 2008 and in
Japan in 2009, as well as growing adoption of our ALTRUA&#174; family of pacemaker systems, launched
worldwide during 2008. In addition, worldwide net sales of our coronary stent systems increased $28
million, or two percent, on the success of our two-drug platform strategy and industry leadership
for the widest range of coronary stent sizes. We are the only company in the industry to offer a
two-drug platform strategy, which we believe has enabled us to maintain our leadership position in
the worldwide drug-eluting stent market. Worldwide net sales from our Endoscopy business grew $63
million, or seven percent, achieving net sales of $1.006&nbsp;billion in 2009, on the continued success
of our biliary and hemostasis franchises. Worldwide net sales from our Urology/Women&#146;s Health
business grew $25&nbsp;million, or six percent, due primarily to several successful product launches
within our Women&#146;s Health franchise during the year. Our Neuromodulation division increased
worldwide net sales $40&nbsp;million, or 17&nbsp;percent, in 2009, as compared to 2008, as a result of the
continued adoption of our Precision&#174; Spinal Cord Stimulation system. Net sales from our
Neurovascular business decreased $12&nbsp;million, or three percent, in 2009, as compared to 2008,

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the fourth quarter of 2008, the decline in our stock price and our market capitalization
created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance. Therefore, we performed an

our acquisition of Guidant Corporation. The impact of economic conditions, and the related increase
in volatility in the equity and credit markets, on our risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Cash generated by operating activities was $835&nbsp;million in 2009 and $1.216&nbsp;billion in 2008, and
continues to be a major source of funds for servicing our outstanding debt obligations and
investing in our growth. Our cash flows from operations in 2009 includes a $716&nbsp;million payment to
Johnson &#038; Johnson related to certain patent disputes, discussed in <I>Note L &#151; Commitments and
Contingencies </I>to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report.
As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had total debt of $5.918&nbsp;billion, cash and cash equivalents of $864
million and working capital of $1.039&nbsp;billion. On February&nbsp;1, 2010, we made a $1.000&nbsp;billion
litigation-related payment to Johnson &#038; Johnson, using $800&nbsp;million of cash on hand, and $200
million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and will pay an additional $725&nbsp;million
on or before January&nbsp;3, 2011. During 2009, we issued $2.0&nbsp;billion of senior notes and prepaid all
$2.825&nbsp;billion remaining under our term loan. In addition, Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s upgraded our credit
rating to investment grade with a stable outlook. This rating improvement reflects the strength of
our product portfolio, our commitment to debt reduction, our improving financial fundamentals, and
the progress we are making in driving profitable sales growth. We expect to refinance the majority

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential
fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and
private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation,
competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies,
technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do
business, including the U.S. These changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on
the delivery of more cost-effective treatments. Although we believe our less-invasive products and
technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources
necessary to demonstrate comparative effectiveness may be significant. In addition, uncertainty
remains regarding proposed significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system, including the
potential innovation tax on medical device companies.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Additionally, our results of operations could be substantially affected by global economic factors
and local operating and economic conditions. Our customers may experience financial difficulties or
be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or
decision to purchase our products, particularly capital equipment, or to pay for our products they
do purchase on a timely basis, if at all. We cannot predict to what extent global economic
conditions and the increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the U.S. and abroad may
negatively impact our average selling prices, our net sales and profit margins, procedural volumes
and reimbursement rates from third party payors.

majority of the markets in which we compete. Over the past thirty years, we have generated
impressive revenue growth driven by product innovation, strategic acquisitions and robust
investments in research and development. We generate strong cash flow, which has enabled us to
reduce our debt obligations
and further invest in our growth. On an on-going basis, we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the
healthcare industry, and the markets in which we compete; and we continue to assess opportunities
for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, and better alignment of expenses with
revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in quality, research and development
projects, capital and our people that are essential to our long-term success. As a result of these
assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives to focus our business, diversify

changes and restructuring initiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to strengthen and

Cardiovascular and CRM businesses, as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and
corporate functions; the centralization of our research and development organization; the
re-alignment of our international structure, and the reprioritization and diversification of our
product portfolio, in order to drive innovation, accelerate profitable growth and increase both
accountability and shareholder value. Activities under the 2010 Restructuring Plan will be
initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of
2011. We expect the execution of the 2010 Restructuring plan will result in the elimination of

reduction plan (the 2007 Restructuring plan), These initiatives were designed to enhance short-
and long-term shareholder value, including the restructuring of several of our businesses and
product franchises; the sale of non-strategic businesses and investments; and significant expense
and head count reductions. Our goal was, and continues to be, to better align expenses with
revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in quality, research and
development, capital improvements and our people that are essential to our long-term success. These
initiatives have helped to provide better focus on our core businesses and priorities, which we
believe will strengthen Boston Scientific for the future and position us for increased, sustainable
and profitable sales growth. The execution of this plan enabled us to reduce research and
development and selling, general and administrative expenses by an annualized run rate of
approximately $500&nbsp;million exiting 2008, and resulted in the elimination of approximately 2,300
positions worldwide. We initiated activities under the plan in the fourth quarter of 2007 and

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We estimate that the worldwide CRM market, including Electrophysiology, approximated $12.6&nbsp;billion
in 2009, as compared to $12.2&nbsp;billion in 2008. During the third quarter of 2009, results were
published in the New England Journal of Medicine from the Boston Scientific sponsored MADIT-CRT
clinical trial, which provide evidence that Boston Scientific&#146;s CRT-D therapy significantly reduces
the relative risk of all-cause mortality or first heart failure intervention when compared to
traditional ICD therapy. These results demonstrated that early intervention with Boston
Scientific&#146;s CRT-D therapy in certain patients can slow the progression of heart failure. In
addition, during the second quarter of 2009, we announced eight-year follow-up data from our MADIT
II clinical study, which demonstrated that the life-saving benefits of ICD therapy improved over
time. We have completed a pre-market approval filing with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)&nbsp;for an expanded CRT-D indication, and believe that we can reasonably expect FDA approval by
mid-2010. We believe an expanded indication would create an opportunity to strengthen the CRM
market and further enhance our position within that market.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">2009 CRM group net sales as compared to the prior year, international sales of our
ICD systems (including CRT-D systems) grew $31&nbsp;million, or six percent, driven by the continued
adoption of our COGNIS&#174; CRT-D and TELIGEN&#174; ICD systems. Further, our international pacemaker system
net sales increased $18&nbsp;million, or seven percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency
exchange rates, in 2009, as compared to 2008, driven primarily by growing adoption of our ALTRUA&#174;
family of pacemakers. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we launched our COGNIS&#174; CRT-D, TELIGEN&#174; ICD
and ALTRUA&#174; pacemaker systems in Japan. We are targeting the completion of our international launch
of these systems in early 2010. In addition, in July&nbsp;2009, we received CE Mark approval for our
LATITUDE&#174; Patient Management System and have begun a phased launch in certain European countries.
The LATITUDE&#174; technology, which enables physicians to monitor device performance remotely while
patients are in their homes, is a key component of many of our implantable device systems. We also
plan to launch our next-generation INGENIO&#153; pacemaker system in our EMEA region and certain
Inter-Continental countries in the first quarter of 2011, and in Japan in the fourth quarter of
2011, and believe that these launches position us well within the worldwide CRM market.

increases or decreases in our CRM group net sales could have a significant impact on our results of

targeted investments we can continue to grow our worldwide CRM business. However, the following

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our U.S. net sales of drug-eluting stent systems increased $78&nbsp;million, or nine percent, in 2009,
as compared to the prior year. Despite an increase in competition following two new market entrants
during 2008, we maintained our leadership position during 2009 with an estimated 49&nbsp;percent share
of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market, exiting the year with an estimated 46&nbsp;percent share during
the fourth quarter of 2009. We believe we have maintained our position in this market due to the
success of our two-drug platform strategy. The strength of our TAXUS&#174; Libert&#233;&#174; stent system and the
PROMUS&#174; stent system, as well as our TAXUS&#174; Express<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">2</SUP>&#174; Atom&#153; stent system, launched in
the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2008, have combined to enable us to sustain our leadership in
the U.S. drug-eluting stent market. In the second quarter of 2009, we received FDA approval for the
TAXUS&#174; Libert&#233;&#174; Atom&#153; stent system and, in July&nbsp;2009, we received approval for the TAXUS&#174; Libert&#233;&#174;
Long stent system, further adding to our industry leadership for the widest range of coronary stent
sizes. In addition, increasing penetration rates
have had a positive effect on the size of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market and our net sales.
Average drug-eluting stent penetration rates in the U.S. were 75&nbsp;percent during 2009, exiting at 77
percent for the fourth quarter of 2009, as compared to 68&nbsp;percent for 2008, with an exit rate of 73
percent. Penetration rates in the U.S. consistently increased throughout 2008 and have remained
steady throughout 2009,

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">indicating a recovery and stabilization of the U.S. drug-eluting stent
market. Partially offsetting the impact of increased penetration rates on the size of the market
were reductions in average selling prices in 2009, as compared to 2008, as a result of competitive
pricing pressures. We estimate that the average selling price of our drug-eluting stent systems in
the U.S. decreased approximately eight percent in 2009, as compared to the prior year.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our international drug-eluting stent system net sales decreased $4&nbsp;million, or less than one
percent, in 2009 as compared to 2008, but were negatively impacted by $22&nbsp;million, as compared to
the same period in the prior year, as a result of foreign currency exchange rates. Within our
international business, net sales of our drug-eluting stent systems in Japan increased $45&nbsp;million,
or 20&nbsp;percent, in 2009, as compared to the prior year, driven primarily by the favorable impact of
foreign currency exchange rates in that region, as well as the February launch of our
second-generation TAXUS&#174; Libert&#233;&#174; stent system. We estimate that our share of the drug-eluting
stent market in Japan was 49&nbsp;percent in 2009, exiting at 44&nbsp;percent, as compared to a 2008 average
market share of 45&nbsp;percent. Previously, our TAXUS&#174; drug-eluting stent system was one of only two
drug-eluting stent products on the market in Japan. In May&nbsp;2009, however, an additional competitor
entered this market, which negatively impacted our share throughout the second half of the year. In
the first quarter of 2010, we received approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and
Welfare (MHLW)&nbsp;for the PROMUS&#174; stent, and subsequently launched this product in Japan. Our net
sales of drug-eluting stent systems in our EMEA region decreased $42&nbsp;million, or eleven percent,
and net sales of these systems in our Inter-Continental region decreased $7&nbsp;million, or three
percent, both due primarily to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and
reductions in our average selling prices. In November&nbsp;2009, we announced receipt of CE Mark
approval to market our next-generation internally-manufactured everolimus-eluting stent system, the
PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; stent system, and simultaneously launched this stent system in our EMEA region and
certain Inter-Continental countries. Our PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; stent system incorporates a unique
platinum chromium alloy offering greater radial strength and flexibility than older alloys, and
provides enhanced visibility and reduced recoil. The innovative stent design improves
deliverability and allows for more consistent lesion coverage and drug distribution. This latest
product offering demonstrates our commitment to drug-eluting stent market leadership and continued
innovation. Our product pipeline also includes the next-generation TAXUS&#174; Element&#153; stent system,
which we expect to launch in EMEA and certain Inter-Continental countries during the first half of
2010, in the U.S. in mid-2011 and Japan in late 2011 or early 2012.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We market the PROMUS&#174; everolimus-eluting coronary stent system, a private-labeled XIENCE V&#174; stent
system supplied to us by Abbott Laboratories. As of the closing of Abbott&#146;s 2006 acquisition of
Guidant Corporation&#146;s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, we obtained a
perpetual license to the intellectual property used in Guidant&#146;s drug-eluting stent system program
purchased by Abbott. We believe that being the only company to offer two distinct drug-eluting
stent platforms provides us a considerable advantage in the drug-eluting stent market and has
enabled us to sustain our worldwide leadership position, with an estimated 39&nbsp;percent market share
exiting 2009. However, under the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the gross profit and
operating profit margin of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott, including any
improvements or iterations approved for sale during the term of the applicable supply arrangements
and of the type that could be approved by a supplement to an approved FDA pre-market approval, is
significantly lower than that of our TAXUS&#174; stent system. Specifically, the PROMUS&#174; stent system
has operating profit margins that approximate half of our TAXUS&#174; stent system operating profit
margin. Therefore, if sales of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott increase
in relation to our total drug-eluting stent system sales, our profit margins will decrease. Refer
to our <I>Gross Profit </I>discussion for more information on the impact this sales mix has had on our
gross profit margins. We expect that our PROMUS&#174; Element<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">TM</SUP> stent
system, launched in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries in November&nbsp;2009, will
have gross profit margins more comparable to our TAXUS&#174; stent system and will positively affect our
overall gross profit and operating profit margins in these regions. However, this positive impact

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">gross profit margin will be offset by the impact of recent approval and launch of the
PROMUS&#174; stent system, supplied to us by Abbott, in Japan.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Further, the price we pay for our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems from Abbott is
determined by contracts with Abbott and is based, in part, on previously fixed estimates of
Abbott&#146;s manufacturing costs for everolimus-eluting stent systems and third-party reports of our
average selling price of these stent systems. Amounts paid pursuant to this pricing arrangement are
subject to a retroactive adjustment approximately every two years based on Abbott&#146;s actual costs to
manufacture these stent systems for us and our average selling price of everolimus-eluting stent
systems supplied to us by Abbott. Our gross profit margin may be positively or negatively impacted
in the future as a result of this adjustment process.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are currently reliant on Abbott for our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems in the U.S.
and Japan. Our supply agreement with Abbott for everolimus-eluting stent systems in these regions
extends through the end of the second quarter of 2012. At present, we believe that our supply of
everolimus-eluting stent systems from Abbott and our current launch plans for our next-generation
internally-manufactured everolimus-eluting stent system is sufficient to meet customer demand.
However, any production or capacity issues that affect Abbott&#146;s manufacturing capabilities or our
process for forecasting, ordering and receiving shipments may impact the ability to increase or
decrease our level of supply in a timely manner; therefore, our supply of everolimus-eluting stent
systems supplied to us by Abbott may not align with customer demand, which could have an adverse
effect on our operating results. We expect to launch an internally developed and manufactured
next-generation everolimus-eluting stent system, our PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; stent system, in the U.S. and
Japan in mid-2012.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with
significant market share volatility. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we
conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient
populations and trial end points. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future
clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the market&#146;s perception
of these clinical data, may adversely impact our position in, and share of the drug-eluting stent
market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market.

multiple matters with Johnson &#038; Johnson; all outstanding litigation between us and Medtronic, Inc.
with respect to interventional cardiology and endovascular repair cases; and all outstanding
litigation between us and Bruce Saffran, M.D., Ph.D. However, there continues to be significant
intellectual property litigation in the coronary stent market. In particular, although our recent
settlements with Johnson &#038; Johnson resolved 17 litigation matters, we continue to be involved in
patent litigation with Johnson &#038; Johnson relating to drug eluting stent delivery systems. We have
each asserted that products of the other infringe patents owned or exclusively licensed by each of
us. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our
ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of
operation or liquidity. See <I>Note L- Commitments and Contingencies </I>to our consolidated financial

$684&nbsp;million in 2008, a decrease of $23&nbsp;million or three percent. Foreign currency exchange rates
contributed a negative $10&nbsp;million to our 2009 Peripheral Interventions net sales, as compared to
the same period in the prior year. We believe that we are well positioned in the growing Peripheral
Interventions market, due in part to the recent launches of our Carotid WALLSTENT&#174; Monorail&#174;

$489&nbsp;million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, our worldwide Endoscopy net
sales increased eight percent in 2009, as compared to 2008. This increase was due primarily to
higher net sales within our stent franchise, due largely to the U.S. launch of the WallFlex&#174;
biliary stent system and continued commercialization of the WallFlex&#174; esophageal stent. In
addition, our hemostasis franchise net sales benefited from increased utilization of our
Resolution&#174; Clip Device, an endoscopic mechanical clip to treat gastrointestinal bleeding, and our

six percent, to $456&nbsp;million in 2009. Our U.S. net sales increased $18&nbsp;million during 2009, as
compared to the prior year, to $353&nbsp;million, and our international net sales increased $7&nbsp;million,
as compared to 2008, to $103&nbsp;million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, net
sales of our Urology/Women&#146;s Health products increased $27&nbsp;million, or six percent, in 2009, as
compared to 2008, and were negatively impacted by a July&nbsp;2009 recall related to catheters used in
our Prolieve Thermodilatation&#174; System for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. This
recall had a negative impact of approximately $8&nbsp;million resulting from estimated lost sales. The
product issue that resulted in this recall has been corrected, and we re-launched the new catheter

used for the management of chronic pain. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products
increased to $285&nbsp;million for 2009, as compared to $245&nbsp;million for 2008, an increase of
$40&nbsp;million or approximately 17&nbsp;percent. Our U.S. net sales of Neuromodulation products were $271
million for 2009, as compared to $234&nbsp;million in the prior year. We believe that we continue to
have a technology advantage over our competitors with proprietary features such as Multiple
Independent Current Control, which is intended to allow the physician to target specific areas of
pain more precisely. As a demonstration of our commitment to strengthening clinical evidence with
spinal cord stimulation, we are initiating a trial to assess the therapeutic effectiveness and cost
effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation compared to reoperation in patients with failed back
surgery syndrome. We believe that this trial could result in consideration of spinal cord
stimulation much earlier in the continuum of care. In addition, we anticipate the launch of two new
lead products during 2010. These factors, coupled with the move of our Neuromodulation business to
a new state-of-the-art facility, position us well for continued growth in this market.

leading market positions in several product markets. Our worldwide net sales of Neurovascular
products decreased to $348&nbsp;million in 2009, as compared to $360&nbsp;million for 2008, a decrease of $12
million, or three percent, resulting primarily from new competitive
launches and a delay in the launch of our next-generation products. The unfavorable
impact of foreign currency exchange rates contributed a negative $4&nbsp;million to our worldwide
Neurovascular sales in 2009, as compared to 2008. We plan to launch a next-generation family of
detachable coils, including an enhanced delivery system designed to reduce coil detachment times,
in the U.S. in 2010. Within our product pipeline, we are also developing next-generation

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we
may obtain externally through strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our research and development
efforts are focused largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings
across multiple programs and divisions. We expect to continue to invest in our core franchises and
are also investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, areas
including atrial fibrillation, underserved defibrillator populations, acute ischemic stroke,
coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, structural heart disease, vascular closure,
hypertension, women&#146;s health, endoluminal surgery, diabetes/obesity, endoscopic pulmonary
intervention and deep brain stimulation. There can be no assurance that these technologies will
achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approvals or gain market acceptance. A delay
in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our future growth.

for sustained growth, the full benefit of these alliances is highly dependent on the strength of
the other companies&#146; underlying technology and ability to execute. An inability to achieve
regulatory approvals and launch competitive product offerings, or litigation related to these
technologies, among other factors, may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these strategic
alliances. Certain of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the
future. Any potential future acquisitions we consummate may be dilutive to our earnings and may
require additional debt or equity financing, depending on their size and nature.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>Regulatory Compliance</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In January&nbsp;2006, legacy Boston Scientific received a corporate warning letter from the FDA
notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three of our facilities and advising us that our
corporate-wide corrective action plan relating to three site-specific warning letters issued to us
in 2005 was inadequate. We have identified solutions to the quality system issues cited by the FDA
and have made significant progress in transitioning our organization to implement those solutions.
During 2008, the FDA reinspected a number of our facilities and, in October&nbsp;2008, informed us that
our quality system is now in substantial compliance with its Quality System Regulations. The FDA
has approved all of our requests for final approval of Class&nbsp;III product submissions previously on
hold due to the corporate warning letter and is processing all requests for Certificates to Foreign
Governments (CFGs). In November of 2009 and January of 2010, the FDA reinspected two official
action-indicated Boston Scientific sites to follow up on observations from the 2008 FDA
inspections. Both of these FDA inspections confirmed that all issues at the sites have been
resolved and all restrictions related to the corporate warning letter have been removed. The
corporate warning letter remains in place pending FDA internal administrative procedures.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the first quarter of 2009, we acquired a third-party sterilization facility which was
subject to a warning letter from the FDA. The FDA had requested documentation and explanations
regarding various corrective actions related to the facility. This information was provided to the
FDA and the FDA has since re-inspected the facility, issuing no observations, and subsequently
removed all restrictions related to the warning letter.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Other Governmental Matters</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Certain state governments have recently enacted, and the federal government has proposed,
legislation aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between industry and health care
professionals (HCPs). As a result, we are required by law to report many types of direct and
indirect payments and other transfers of value to HCPs licensed by certain states and expect that
we will have to make similar reports at the federal level in the near future. We are devoting
substantial time and financial resources in order to develop and implement enhanced structure,
policies, systems and processes in order to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements.
Our new systems are designed to provide enhanced visibility and consistency across our businesses
with respect to our interactions with health care professionals. Implementation of these policies,
systems and processes, or failure to comply with these policies could have a negative impact our
results of operations.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers
worldwide that typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g.,
Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed-care programs for the healthcare
services provided to their patients. Third-party payors may provide or deny coverage for certain
technologies and
associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria. Reimbursement by
third-party payors for these services is based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect
the services&#146;

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value. These reimbursement
methodologies confer different, and sometimes conflicting, levels of financial risk and incentives
to HCPs and patients, and these methodologies are subject to frequent refinements. Third-party
payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates and challenging the prices charged for
medical products and services. There can be no assurance that our products will be automatically
covered by third-party payors, that reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the
third-party payors&#146; coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products
profitably. Accordingly, the outcome of these reimbursement decisions could have an adverse impact
on our business. In addition, the current economic climate may impose further pressure on funds
available for reimbursement of healthcare and on reimbursement levels.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>Manufacturing and Raw Materials</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We design and manufacture the majority of our products in technology centers around the world. Many
components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available
raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources. Certain items are
custom made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity exists at
our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a
reasonable period of time. We also have an on-going program to identify single-source components
and to develop alternative back-up supplies. However, in certain cases, we may not be able to
quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for specific components, materials or
products, largely due to the regulatory approval system and the complex nature of our manufacturing
processes and those of our suppliers. A reduction or interruption in supply, an inability to
develop and validate alternative sources if required, or a significant increase in the price of raw
materials, components or products could adversely affect our operations and financial condition,
particularly materials or components related to our CRM products and drug-eluting stent systems. In
addition, our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal
resources and third party vendors to perform this service. To the extent our sterilizers
are unable to process our products, whether due to raw material, capacity, regulatory or other
constraints, we may be unable to transition to other providers in a timely manner, which could have
an adverse impact on our operations.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>International Markets</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties
related to economic conditions in these regions, currency fluctuations, regulatory and
reimbursement approvals, competitive offerings, infrastructure development, rights to intellectual
property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy. Any significant changes in the
competitive, political, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct
international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results
of operations. International markets, including Japan, are affected by economic pressure to contain
reimbursement levels and healthcare costs. Initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs,
including price regulation, are under way in many countries in which we do business. Implementation
of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as Japan, Europe
and other international markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is
provided for, our products and may influence a physician&#146;s selection of products used to treat
patients. We expect these practices to put increased pressure on reimbursement rates in these
markets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, most international jurisdictions have adopted regulatory approval and periodic renewal
requirements for medical devices, and we must comply with these requirements in order to market our
products in these jurisdictions. Further, some emerging markets rely on the FDA&#146;s CFGs in lieu of
their own regulatory approval requirements. Although the corporate warning letter has not been

risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level. To calculate revenue growth rates
that exclude the impact of currency exchange, we convert current period and prior period net sales
from local currency to U.S. dollars using current period currency exchange rates. The regional
constant currency growth rates in the tables below can be recalculated from our net sales by
reportable segment as presented in <I>Note P &#151; Segment Reporting </I>to our consolidated financial

businesses from the net sales of our reportable segments. During the first quarter of 2009, we
reorganized our international structure to provide more direct sales focus in the marketplace.
Accordingly, we have revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage and
view our business. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had four reportable segments based on geographic
regions: the United States; EMEA, consisting of Europe, the Middle East and Africa; Japan; and
Inter-Continental, consisting of Asia Pacific and the Americas. The reportable segments represent

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The following table provides our worldwide net sales by division and the relative change on an
as reported and constant currency basis. During the first quarter of 2009, we combined our
Peripheral Embolization business, previously a component of our Neurovascular division, with our
Peripheral Interventions business. We have reclassified previously reported 2008 and 2007 results
to be consistent with the 2009 presentation.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2009, our U.S. net sales, excluding net sales from divested businesses, increased
$188&nbsp;million, or four percent, as compared to 2008. The increase was driven primarily by an
increase in U.S. CRM group sales of $114&nbsp;million and an increase of $47&nbsp;million in U.S. sales of
our coronary stent systems. In addition, U.S. sales in our Endosurgery group grew $58&nbsp;million in
2009, as compared to the prior year, and our Neuromodulation division increased U.S. net sales
$37&nbsp;million. These increases were partially offset by declines in U.S. net sales from our
Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) business of $52&nbsp;million and a decrease
of $16&nbsp;million in Peripheral Interventions U.S. net sales in 2009, as compared to the prior year.
Refer to the <I>Business and Market Overview </I>section for a more detailed discussion of our net sales
by U.S. division.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2008, our U.S. net sales, excluding net sales from divested businesses, decreased
$35&nbsp;million, or one percent, as compared to 2007. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in
Cardiovascular division sales of $222&nbsp;million, driven primarily by declines in sales of our
drug-eluting stent systems as a result of increased competition. Partially offsetting this decrease
was an increase in CRM product sales of $109&nbsp;million, as a result of numerous successful product
launches during 2008. In addition, U.S. sales in our Endosurgery division grew $43&nbsp;million in
2008, as compared to 2007, driven by strength in our biliary and hemostasis franchises, and our
Neuromodulation division increased sales by $36&nbsp;million, due to market growth and continued
physician adoption of our Precision Plus&#153; spinal cord stimulation technology.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The primary factor contributing to a shift in product sales mix toward lower margin products in
2009, as compared to 2008, and 2008, as compared to 2007, was a decrease in sales of our higher
margin TAXUS<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> drug-eluting stent systems. The shift in sales away from TAXUS<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> stent systems was due
primarily to increased sales of the PROMUS<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> stent system in the U.S., following its July&nbsp;2008
approval and launch. Sales of the PROMUS<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> stent system represented approximately 40&nbsp;percent of our
worldwide drug-eluting stent system sales in 2009, 19&nbsp;percent in 2008, and two percent in 2007.
Under the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the gross profit margin of a PROMUS<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> stent
system, supplied to us by Abbott, is significantly lower than that of our TAXUS<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> stent system. Our
gross profit margin for 2009, as compared to the prior year, was also positively impacted by 0.9
percentage points attributable to the settlement of foreign currency hedge contracts on
intercompany and third party transactions. The settlement of these contracts had a negative impact
on our gross profit margin of 0.5&nbsp;percentage points in 2008, as compared to 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, our gross profit margins decreased by 0.4&nbsp;percentage points in 2008, as compared to
2007, due to increases in period expenses associated with inventory charges. Inventory and
manufacturing equipment obsolescence charges in 2009 were relatively flat to 2008, and included
approximately $40&nbsp;million of inventory write-downs and manufacturing equipment obsolescence
write-offs within our CRM division, related primarily to the resolution of a product advisory that
resulted in the transition to a new version of our COGNIS<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> CRT-D and TELIGEN<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> ICD system product

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Selling, General and Administrative (SG&#038;A) Expenses</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2009, our SG&#038;A expenses increased by $46&nbsp;million, or two percent, as compared to 2008. This
increase was related primarily to the addition of direct selling expenses and head count, including
expanding our global sales force and an increase in costs associated with various
litigation-related matters. These increases were partially offset by a benefit from foreign
currency exchange rates of approximately $22&nbsp;million. As a percentage of net sales, our SG&#038;A
expenses were flat with 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2008, our SG&#038;A expenses decreased by $320&nbsp;million, or 11&nbsp;percent, as compared to 2007. The
decrease in our SG&#038;A expenses related primarily to lower head count and spending resulting from our
2007 Restructuring plan, as well as a reduction of $160&nbsp;million attributable to our first quarter
2008 divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses. Refer to the <I>Restructuring Initiatives</I>
section for more discussion of these initiatives.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Research and Development (R&#038;D) Expenses</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our investment in R&#038;D reflects spending on new product development programs, as well as regulatory
compliance and clinical research. In 2009, our R&#038;D expenses increased $29&nbsp;million, or three
percent, as compared to 2008. As a percentage of net sales, our R&#038;D expenses in 2009 were
relatively flat with 2008. We remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in
meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy
pipeline of new products that will contribute to our short- and long-term profitable sales growth.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2008, our R&#038;D expenses decreased by $85&nbsp;million, or eight percent, as compared to 2007. As a
percentage of our net sales, R&#038;D expenses decreased to 12.5&nbsp;percent in 2008 from 13.1&nbsp;percent in
2007. The decrease related primarily to lower head count and spending of $75&nbsp;million resulting from
our first quarter 2008 divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Royalty Expense</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2009, our royalty expense decreased $12&nbsp;million, or six percent, as compared to 2008. The
decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in royalty expense of $29&nbsp;million attributable to
the expiration of a CRM royalty agreement during the first quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting
this decrease was an increase in royalty expense of $20&nbsp;million as a result of an increase in sales
of our drug-eluting stent systems, as well as the shift in the mix of our drug-eluting stent system
sales towards the PROMUS<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> stent system, following its launch in the U.S. in mid-2008. The royalty
rate applied to sales of the PROMUS<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> stent system is, on average, higher than that associated with
sales of our TAXUS<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> stent system.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2008, our royalty expense increased by $1&nbsp;million, or less than one percent, as compared to
2007. As a percentage of our net sales, royalty expense increased slightly to 2.5&nbsp;percent from 2.4
percent for 2007.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Royalty expense attributable to sales of our drug-eluting stent systems increased $8&nbsp;million as
compared to 2007, despite an overall decrease in drug-eluting stent system sales. This was due to a
shift in the mix of our drug-eluting stent system sales towards the PROMUS<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> stent system.
Offsetting this increase was a decrease in royalty expense of $6&nbsp;million attributable to our first
quarter 2008 divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the second quarter of 2009, we cancelled one of our internal R&#038;D programs in order to focus on
those with a higher likelihood of success. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $16&nbsp;million,
in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)&nbsp;Accounting Standards
Codification<FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#212;</FONT> (ASC)&nbsp;Topic 420, <I>Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations </I>(formerly FASB Statement
No.&nbsp;146, <I>Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities), </I>associated with future

results of operations or cash flows.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our amortization expense was $511&nbsp;million in 2009, as compared to $543&nbsp;million in 2008, a decrease
of $32&nbsp;million or six percent. This decrease was due primarily to the impact of certain
Interventional Cardiology-related intangible assets reaching the end of their accounting useful
life during 2008, as well as the write-down of certain intangible assets to their fair values in
2009 and 2008, described in <I>Other Intangible Asset Impairment Charges </I>below.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our amortization expense was $543&nbsp;million in 2008, as compared to $620&nbsp;million in 2007, a decrease
of $77&nbsp;million, or 12&nbsp;percent. The decrease in our amortization expense related primarily to the
disposal of $581&nbsp;million of amortizable intangible assets in connection with our first quarter 2008
business divestitures, and to certain Interventional Cardiology-related intangible assets reaching
the end of their accounting useful life.

payment of $250&nbsp;million from Abbott upon receipt of an approval from the Japanese MHLW to market
the XIENCE V<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> stent system in Japan. The MHLW approved the XIENCE V<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> stent system in the first

acquired in a business combination that had no alternative future use to be measured at their fair

purchased research and development acquired in a business combination be recognized as an
indefinite-lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research

any future business combinations that we enter, we will recognize purchased research and
development as an intangible asset.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our policy is to record certain costs associated with strategic alliances as purchased research and

respect to asset purchases. In accordance with this policy, during 2009, we recorded purchased
research and development charges of $21&nbsp;million in conjunction with entering certain licensing and
development arrangements. Since the 2009 technology purchases did not involve the transfer of
processes or outputs as defined by Statement No.&nbsp;141(R) (Topic 805), the transactions did not
qualify as business combinations.

reduction plan (the 2007 Restructuring plan), which resulted in the elimination of approximately
2,300 positions worldwide. We are providing affected employees with severance packages,
outplacement services and other appropriate assistance and support. The plan is intended to bring
expenses in line with revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short- and long-term
shareholder value. Key activities under the plan include the restructuring of several businesses,
corporate functions and product franchises in order to better utilize resources, strengthen
competitive positions, and create a more simplified and efficient business model; the elimination,
suspension or reduction of spending on certain research and development projects; and the transfer
of certain production lines among facilities. We initiated these activities in the fourth quarter
of 2007. The transfer of production lines contemplated under the 2007 Restructuring plan will
continue throughout 2010; all other major activities under the plan were completed as of December
31, 2009.

the plan, and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining
portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. We expect the plan to
result in cash payments of approximately $375&nbsp;million to $385&nbsp;million, of which we have made
payments of $330&nbsp;million to date. The following provides a summary of our expected total costs

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a result of the execution of our 2007 Restructuring plan and our divestiture-related
initiatives, we reduced research and development and SG&#038;A expenses by an annualized run rate of
approximately $500&nbsp;million exiting 2008. In addition, we expect annualized run-rate reductions of
manufacturing costs of approximately $35&nbsp;million to $40&nbsp;million as a result of our transfers of
production lines. Due to the longer-term nature of these initiatives, we do not expect to achieve
the full benefit of these reductions in manufacturing costs until 2012. We have partially
reinvested our savings from these initiatives into targeted head count increases, primarily in
customer-facing positions, to drive future sales growth.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, in January&nbsp;2009, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a Plant Network
Optimization program, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by
transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities. The
program is a complement to our 2007 Restructuring plan, and is intended to improve overall
gross profit margins. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the
first quarter of 2009 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2011. We estimate
that the program will result in annual reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately
$65&nbsp;million to $80&nbsp;million in 2012. These savings are in addition to the estimated $35&nbsp;million to
$40&nbsp;million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs in 2012 from activities under our 2007
Restructuring plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We expect that the execution of the Plant Network Optimization program will result in total pre-tax
charges of approximately $135&nbsp;million to $150&nbsp;million, and that approximately $115&nbsp;million to
$125&nbsp;million of these charges will result in future cash outlays. The following provides a summary
of our estimates of costs associated with the Plant Network Optimization program by major type of
cost:

initiatives pursuant to our 2007 Restructuring plan, which related to termination benefits,
production line transfer costs and other restructuring costs. We have made cumulative cash payments
of approximately $330&nbsp;million since we committed to the 2007 Restructuring plan. These payments
were made using cash generated from our operations. We expect to record the remaining costs
associated with the 2007 Restructuring plan through 2010, and make future cash payments throughout
2010 using cash generated from operations. In 2009, since the inception of our Plant Network
Optimization program, we have made associated cash payments of $12&nbsp;million. These payments were
made using cash generated from our operations. We expect to record the remaining costs associated
with the Plant Network Optimization program through 2011, and make future cash payments through

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Further, on February&nbsp;6, 2010, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a series of
management changes and restructuring initiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to
strengthen and position us for long-term success. We estimate that the execution of this plan will
result in reductions in pre-tax operating expenses of approximately $200&nbsp;million to $250&nbsp;million,
once completed in 2011. We will reinvest a portion of the savings into customer facing and other
activities to help drive future sales growth and support the business. Key activities under the
plan include the integration of our Cardiovascular and CRM businesses, as well as the restructuring
of certain other businesses and corporate functions; the centralization of our R&#038;D organization;
the re-alignment of our international structure, and the reprioritization and diversification of
our product portfolio, in order to drive innovation, accelerate profitable growth and increase both
accountability and shareholder value. Activities under the 2010 Restructuring plan will be
initiated in early 2010 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2011.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We estimate that the 2010 Restructuring plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately
$180&nbsp;million to $200&nbsp;million, and that approximately $170&nbsp;million to $190&nbsp;million of these charges
will result in future cash outlays. We expect the execution of the plan will result in the
elimination of approximately

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We record certain significant litigation-related activity as a separate line item in our
consolidated statements of operations. In 2009, we recorded litigation-related charges of $2.022
billion, associated primarily with an agreement to settle three patent disputes with Johnson &#038;
Johnson for $1.725&nbsp;billion, plus interest. In addition, in November&nbsp;2009, we reached an agreement
in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice to pay $296&nbsp;million in order to resolve the U.S.
Government investigation of Guidant Corporation related to product advisories issued in 2005.
Further, during 2009, we recorded charges of $50&nbsp;million associated with the settlement of all
outstanding litigation with Bruce Saffran, and reduced previously recorded reserves associated with
certain litigation-related matters following certain favorable court rulings, resulting in a credit
of $60&nbsp;million. In 2008, we recorded litigation-related charges of $334&nbsp;million as a result of a
ruling by a federal judge in a patent infringement case brought against us by Johnson &#038; Johnson,
and, in 2007, recorded litigation-related charges of $365&nbsp;million, associated with this case. Each
of these matters is discussed in <I>Note L &#151; Commitments and Contingencies </I>to our 2009 consolidated
financial statements included in Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our interest expense decreased to $407&nbsp;million in 2009, as compared to $468&nbsp;million in 2008. The
decrease in our interest expense was a result of a decrease in our average debt levels, due to term
loan prepayments during 2009. Partially offsetting these decreases were losses of $27&nbsp;million
associated with the early termination of interest rate contracts for which there was no longer an
underlying exposure following the prepayment of our remaining term loan debt obligations, the
write-off of $7&nbsp;million of debt issuance costs following the prepayment of our term loan, and a
slight increase in our average borrowing rate. Our average borrowing rate was 6.1&nbsp;percent in 2009
and 6.0&nbsp;percent in 2008. Refer to the <I>Liquidity and Capital Resources </I>section and <I>Note I &#151;
Borrowings and Credit Arrangements </I>to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item&nbsp;8 of
this Annual Report for information regarding our debt obligations.

decrease in our interest expense related primarily to a decrease in our average debt levels, due to
debt prepayments of $1.425&nbsp;billion during the year, as well as a decrease in our average borrowing
rate. Our average borrowing rate was 6.0&nbsp;percent for 2008 and 6.3&nbsp;percent in 2007.

million in 2007. Our interest income decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, and in 2008, as
compared to 2007, due primarily to lower average investment rates available in the market, as well
as lower average cash balances. In addition, other, net included net gains of $3&nbsp;million in 2009,
and net losses of $93&nbsp;million in 2008 and $54&nbsp;million in 2007, associated with our investment
portfolio. These gains and losses relate primarily to the sale of our non-strategic investments,

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with our 2006 acquisition of Guidant Corporation and related transaction with Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott was required to sell its shares of our common stock and apply a portion of the
net proceeds from its sale of these shares in excess of specified amounts, if any, to reduce the
principal amount of the loan granted to us from Abbott as part of the Guidant transaction. We
recorded the fair value of this &#145;sharing of proceeds&#146; feature, determined using a Monte Carlo
simulation methodology, as of the acquisition date and revalued the instrument each subsequent
reporting period. As a result, we recorded net expense of $8&nbsp;million during 2007 to reflect a
decrease in fair value resulting from changes in our stock price, among other factors. There was no
fair value associated with this feature as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 or 2008, and all underlying shares
of our common stock have been sold by Abbott.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2009, the decrease in our reported tax rate, as compared to 2008, related primarily to the
impact of certain items that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. In 2009,
these amounts included litigation-related net charges, intangible asset impairment charges,
purchased research and development and restructuring-related charges, as well as a favorable tax
ruling on a divestiture-related gain recognized in a prior period. In 2008, the increase in our
reported tax rate, as compared to 2007, related primarily to the impact of certain charges and
gains that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These amounts related
primarily to gains and losses associated with the divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses
and investments, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, litigation-related charges, and
changes in the geographic mix of our net sales.

unrecognized tax benefits, of which a net $885&nbsp;million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, we had $1.107

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign
jurisdictions. We have concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters through 2000 and substantially
all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters through 2001. During 2009, we received
the Revenue Agent&#146;s Report for our federal tax examination covering years 2004 and 2005, which
contained proposed adjustments, related primarily to transfer pricing and transaction-related
issues. We agreed on certain adjustments and made associated payments of $64&nbsp;million, inclusive of
interest. We disagree with certain positions contained in the Report and intend to contest these
positions through applicable IRS and judicial procedures, as appropriate. We also continue to
disagree with and contest the significant proposed adjustment, related primarily to the allocation
of income between our US and foreign affiliates, contained in the Revenue Agent&#146;s Report received
in 2008 for Guidant&#146;s federal tax examination covering years 2001 through 2003. Although the final
resolution associated with these matters is uncertain, we believe that our income tax reserves are
adequate and that the resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or
results of operations.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2009, the Obama administration announced several legislative proposals to reform the United
States tax rules, including provisions that may limit the deferral of United States income tax on
our unremitted earnings, reduce or eliminate our ability to claim foreign tax credits, and
eliminate various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the U.S. If any of these
proposals are enacted into law, they could have a material adverse impact on our financial position
and results of operations.

servicing our outstanding debt obligations and investing in our growth. The decrease in our
operating cash flow in 2009, as compared to 2008, is due primarily to litigation-related payments
of $823&nbsp;million, associated primarily with patent litigation with Johnson &#038; Johnson. Refer to <I>Note
L &#151; Commitments and Contingencies </I>to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item&nbsp;8 of
this Annual Report for discussion of our legal proceedings. These cash outflows were partially
offset by lower net tax payments of $370&nbsp;million; and lower interest payments of $50&nbsp;million, due
to lower average debt balances, as well as improvements in working capital, particularly the strong
collection of accounts receivable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The increase in operating cash flow in 2008, as compared to 2007, is due primarily to the receipt

million in 2008, as compared to 2007, due to lower average debt balances. These increases were

our prior period acquisition of Advanced Bionics Corporation, described in <I>Note D &#151; Acquisitions </I>to
our accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report. Our
investing activities in 2009 also included payments for investments in privately held companies,
and acquisitions of businesses and certain technology rights of $54&nbsp;million, which were offset by
proceeds from the sale of investments in, and collection of notes receivable from, certain publicly
traded and privately held companies, of $91&nbsp;million. Further, we made capital expenditures of
$312&nbsp;million during 2009. We expect to incur total capital expenditures of approximately
$350&nbsp;million to $400&nbsp;million during 2010, which includes capital expenditures to further upgrade
our quality systems and information systems infrastructure, and to enhance our manufacturing
capabilities to support continued growth in our business units.

million in payments related to prior period acquisitions, associated primarily with Advanced
Bionics; and $39&nbsp;million of net cash payments for investments in privately held companies, and
acquisitions of certain technology rights. In addition, we paid $21&nbsp;million, net of cash acquired,

paid approximately $70&nbsp;million, net of cash acquired, to acquire Remon Medical Technologies, Inc.
We also issued approximately five million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $90
million and paid $10&nbsp;million in cash, in addition to our previous investments of $40&nbsp;million, to
acquire the remaining interests of EndoTex Interventional Systems, Inc. These cash outflows were

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Certain of our acquisitions involve the payment of contingent consideration. See <I>Note D -
Acquisitions </I>to our 2009 consolidated financial statements included in Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report
for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required
to pay associated with our recent acquisitions. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even
if, performance milestones will be reached, or the amount of contingent consideration payable based
on future revenues, the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above.
Additionally, we may consider satisfying these commitments by issuing our stock or refinancing the
commitments with cash, including cash obtained through the sale of our stock.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Certain of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future. Since it
is not possible to estimate when, or even if, we will exercise our option to acquire these
companies, we have not included these future potential payments in the table above.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the first quarter of 2010, we reached an agreement to settle three patent disputes with
Johnson &#038; Johnson for $1.725&nbsp;billion, plus interest. We paid $1.000&nbsp;billion, consisting of $800
million of cash on hand and $200&nbsp;million borrowed from our revolving credit facility, during the
first quarter of 2010 and will satisfy the remaining obligation on or before January&nbsp;3, 2011. In
addition, during the first half of 2011, $1.750&nbsp;billion of our
outstanding debt obligations, as well as our revolving credit facility, will
mature. We expect to refinance the majority of our 2011 debt maturities and revolving credit
facility by mid-2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of
December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had outstanding letters of credit of
$123&nbsp;million, as compared to $819&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees
and collateral for workers&#146; compensation programs. The decrease is due primarily to the payment of
$716&nbsp;million to Johnson &#038; Johnson during 2009 and the termination of an associated letter of
credit. In February&nbsp;2010, we posted a $745&nbsp;million letter of credit under our $1.750&nbsp;billion
revolving credit facility as collateral for the future Johnson and Johnson obligation discussed
above, which reduces availability under the facility by the same amount. See <I>Note L &#151; Commitments
and Contingencies </I>to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual
Report for a description of these legal proceedings. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, none of the
beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees, and, as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and
2008, we had accrued the Johnson &#038; Johnson obligations in our consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly, we have not recognized a related liability for our outstanding letters of credit in
our consolidated balance sheets as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 or 2008. We believe we will generate
sufficient cash from operations to fund these payments without drawing on the letters of credit. We
also maintain a $350&nbsp;million credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had $54&nbsp;million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving
credit facility. There were no other amounts borrowed under these facilities as of December&nbsp;31,
2009 or December&nbsp;31, 2008.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies. We have
adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). We describe these
accounting polices in <I>Note A&#151;Significant Accounting Policies </I>to our 2009 consolidated financial
statements included in Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes
estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the
reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may
differ from these estimates.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">




<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We consider estimates to be critical if (i)&nbsp;we are required to make assumptions about material
matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii)&nbsp;materially different estimates
could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from
period to period. The following are areas requiring management&#146;s judgment that we consider
critical:
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>Revenue Recognition</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We generate revenue primarily from the sale of single-use medical devices, and present revenue net
of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations. We consider revenue to be realized or
realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales
arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price is fixed or
determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. We generally meet these criteria at the
time of shipment, unless a consignment arrangement exists or we are required to provide additional
services. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, or implant,
which indicates that the sale is complete. For our other transactions, we recognize revenue when
our products are delivered and risk of loss transfers to the customer, provided there are no
substantive remaining performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer
acceptance, and provided we can form an estimate for sales returns. For multiple-element
arrangements where the sale of devices is combined with future service obligations, as with our
LATITUDE<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> Patient Management System, we defer revenue on the undelivered element based on
verifiable objective evidence of fair value and using the residual method of allocation, and
recognize the associated revenue over the related service period.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired
products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the
amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow
customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings; for these
transactions, we defer recognition of revenue based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be
returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as
a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current. We estimate rebates for
products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of
expected future rebates. If we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably, we record a
liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered. We have entered certain agreements with group
purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices. We
recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed
above.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>Warranty Obligations</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on historical experience.
We record a liability equal to the costs to repair or otherwise satisfy the claim as cost of
products sold at the time the product sale occurs. Factors that affect our warranty liability
include the number of units sold, the historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the
cost per claim. We assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities on a quarterly basis
and adjust the amounts as necessary.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>Inventory Provisions</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We base our provisions for excess and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted
net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to
forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess and obsolete inventory
in the future. The industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development
and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals,
variability in product

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We record intangible assets acquired in business combinations under the purchase method of
accounting. We allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and
liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition, including
identifiable intangible assets and purchased research and development which either arise from a
contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. We base the fair value of identifiable
intangible assets and purchased research and development on detailed valuations that use
information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management&#146;s best estimates of
inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate any excess purchase price
over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill.
The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated cash flows and discount rates,
and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different purchase price
allocations, amounts for purchased research and development, and intangible asset amortization expense
in current and future periods.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of January&nbsp;1, 2009, we adopted FASB Statement No.&nbsp;141(R), <I>Business Combinations </I>(codified within
ASC Topic 805, <I>Business Combinations</I>). Pursuant to the guidance in Statement No.&nbsp;141(R) (Topic
805), in those circumstances where an acquisition involves contingent consideration, we would
recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payment at the acquisition date.
For acquisitions consummated prior to January&nbsp;1, 2009, we will continue to record contingent
consideration as an additional element of cost of the acquired entity when the contingency is
resolved and consideration is issued or becomes issuable.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>Purchased Research and Development</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our purchased research and development represents the value of acquired in-process projects that
have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date
of acquisition. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects
is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic
region. Through December&nbsp;31, 2008 we expensed the value attributable to these in-process projects
at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accounting standards effective through that date.
As discussed above, as of January&nbsp;1, 2009, we adopted FASB Statement No.&nbsp;141(R), <I>Business
Combinations </I>(codified within ASC Topic 805, <I>Business Combinations</I>), a replacement for Statement
No.&nbsp;141. Statement No.&nbsp;141(R) also superseded FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;4, <I>Applicability of FASB
Statement No.&nbsp;2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method</I>, which required
research and development assets acquired in a business combination that had no alternative future
use to be measured at their fair values and expensed at the acquisition date. Statement No.&nbsp;141(R)
(Topic 805) requires that purchased research and development acquired in a business combination be
recognized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the
associated research and development efforts. During 2009, we did not consummate any material
business combinations. For any future business combinations that we enter, we will recognize
purchased research and development as an intangible asset.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, we record certain costs associated with strategic alliances as purchased research and
development. Our adoption of Statement No.&nbsp;141(R) (Topic 805) did not change this policy with
respect to asset purchases.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development.
This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an
in-process project over its useful life and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a
present value. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected
market growth rates,

completion; the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date; the costs already
incurred; the projected costs to complete; the contribution of core technologies and other acquired
assets; the expected introduction date; and the estimated useful life of the technology. We base
the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value
of money and medical technology investment risk factors. For the in-process projects acquired in
connection with our recent acquisitions, we used risk-adjusted discount rates of 34&nbsp;percent in 2008
and 19&nbsp;percent in 2007 to discount our projected cash flows. We believe that the estimated
in-process research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse
conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a
change in the remaining useful life. In addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at
least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets.
Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse
change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset, a product
recall, or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If an impairment indicator exists, we
test the intangible asset for recoverability. For purposes of the recoverability test, we group
our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of
identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other
assets and liabilities. If the carrying value of the intangible asset (asset group) exceeds the
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible
asset (asset group), we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period
identified. To test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we calculate the fair
value of these assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values.
If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the
carrying value down to the fair value.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future
cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. In determining
our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and
assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the
asset (asset group). The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount
rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of
impairment. See <I>Note E &#151; Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets </I>for more information related to
impairment of intangible assets during 2009, 2008 and 2007.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">these units. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an
operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We determine
our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments, and then assess whether any
components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is
available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component.
We aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. For
our April&nbsp;1, 2009 annual impairment assessment, we identified our reporting units to be our six
U.S. operating segments, which in aggregate make up the U.S. reportable segment, and our four
international operating segments. When allocating goodwill from business combinations to our
reporting units, we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the
respective business combination at the time of acquisition. In addition, for purposes of performing
our annual goodwill impairment test, assets and liabilities, including corporate assets, which
relate to a reporting unit&#146;s operations, and would be considered in determining its fair value, are
allocated to the individual reporting units. We allocate assets and liabilities not directly
related to a specific reporting unit, but from which the reporting unit benefits, based primarily
on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we used only the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow
(DCF)&nbsp;method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill
impairment assessment. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows
attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a present value
using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in
preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately
measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost
approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of
relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to
replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for
application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the
most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair
value of our reporting units.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the
amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate
discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our
most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value
growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our
DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units.
We use  estimates of market participant risk-adjusted weighted-average costs of capital (WACC)&nbsp;as a basis for determining the
discount rates to apply to our reporting units&#146; future expected cash flows.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step
of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step
of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit&#146;s goodwill to
its carrying value. If we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance
of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated,
we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and
disclose that the amount is an estimate. We would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate
in subsequent reporting periods, once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the fourth quarter of 2008, the decline in our stock price and our market capitalization
created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance. Therefore, we performed an
interim impairment test and recorded a $2.613&nbsp;billion goodwill impairment charge associated with
our acquisition of Guidant Corporation. As a result of economic conditions and the related increase
in volatility in the equity and credit markets, which became more pronounced starting in the fourth
quarter of 2008, our estimated risk-adjusted WACC increased 150 basis points from 9.5&nbsp;percent
during our 2008

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">second quarter annual goodwill impairment assessment to 11.0&nbsp;percent during our 2008 fourth quarter
interim impairment assessment. This change, along with reductions in market demand for products in
our U.S. CRM reporting unit relative to our assumptions at the time of the Guidant acquisition,
were the key factors contributing to the impairment charge. Our estimated market participant WACC
decreased 50 basis points from 11.0&nbsp;percent during our 2008 fourth quarter interim impairment
assessment to 10.5&nbsp;percent during our 2009 second quarter annual goodwill impairment assessment,
and our other significant assumptions remained largely consistent. Our 2009 goodwill impairment
test did not identify any reporting units whose carrying values exceeded implied fair values.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The majority of our reporting units do not have a material amount of goodwill that is at risk of
failing a future impairment test.


While we do not believe there are indicators of impairment as of December 31, 2009 to necessitate the
performance of an interim impairment test, we have considered current and future expected economic
conditions as of year end and, as a result, we have identified two reporting units with a material amount
of goodwill that are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the impairment test in future
reporting periods.




 These reporting units include our U.S. CRM group and EMEA region, each to
which we have allocated a significant portion of the goodwill associated with our 2006 acquisition
of Guidant Corporation. The aggregate amount of goodwill allocated to
these reporting units was approximately
$7.4&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.   For each of these reporting units, the level of excess fair value over carrying value
exceeded 25&nbsp;percent as of our second quarter 2009 impairment
assessment.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the
fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and
can vary from actual results. The key variables that drive the fair value of our reporting units
are estimated revenue growth rates and discount rate assumptions. Future events that could have a
negative effect on the fair value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to:

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued ASC Update No.&nbsp;2009-17, <I>Consolidations (Topic 810) &#151;
Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities, </I>which
formally codifies FASB Statement No.&nbsp;167, <I>Amendments to FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;46(R). </I>Update No.
2009-17 and Statement No.&nbsp;167 amends Interpretation No.&nbsp;46(R), <I>Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, </I>to require that an enterprise perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise&#146;s
variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE).
The analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both 1) the
power to direct activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity&#146;s economic
performance and 2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits
from the entity. Update No.&nbsp;2009-17 eliminated the quantitative approach previously required for
determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE and requires ongoing reassessments of whether an
enterprise is the primary beneficiary. We are required to adopt Update No.&nbsp;2009-17 for our first
quarter ending March&nbsp;31, 2010. We do not believe the adoption of Update No.&nbsp;2009-17 will have a
significant impact on our future results of operations or financial position.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific Corporation
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have audited Boston Scientific Corporation&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of
December&nbsp;31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston
Scientific Corporation&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of
December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders&#146;

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are
exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these
risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter
derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial
instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we
manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with
a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding
positions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted
foreign currency denominated intercompany and third party transactions and net investments in
certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and
derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency
exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $4.742
billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $4.396&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. We recorded $56&nbsp;million
of other assets and $110&nbsp;million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these
derivative instruments as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, as compared to $132&nbsp;million of other assets and
$195&nbsp;million of other liabilities as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S.
dollar&#146;s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments&#146; fair
value by $271&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $315&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. A ten
percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar&#146;s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease
the derivative instruments&#146; fair value by $331&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and by $385&nbsp;million
as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate
sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or
increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar
cash investments. We have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our
earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. We had no interest rate derivative
instruments outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, as compared to the notional amount of $4.900
billion outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. These interest rate derivative instruments fixed the
interest rate on our expected LIBOR-indexed floating-rate loans. During 2009, these interest rate
derivative instruments either matured as scheduled or were terminated in connection with the
prepayment of our bank term loan. We recognized $27&nbsp;million of interest expense related to early
termination of these interest rate contracts during 2009. We recorded $46&nbsp;million of other
liabilities to recognize the fair value of our interest rate derivative instruments as of December
31, 2008. A one-percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased the derivative
instruments&#146; fair value by $32&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. A one-percentage point decrease in
interest rates would have decreased the derivative instruments&#146; fair value by $35&nbsp;million as of
December&nbsp;31, 2008. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, $5.917&nbsp;billion of our outstanding debt obligations was
at fixed interest rates, representing nearly 100&nbsp;percent of our total debt.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Boston Scientific Corporation and our
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Through December&nbsp;31, 2009, we assessed the terms of our investment
interests to determine if any of our investees met the definition of a variable interest entity
(VIE)&nbsp;in accordance with accounting standards effective through that date, and would have
consolidated any VIEs in which we were the primary beneficiary. Our evaluation considered both
qualitative and quantitative factors and various assumptions, including expected losses and
residual returns. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, based on these assessments, we did not
consolidate any VIEs. In December&nbsp;2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)&nbsp;issued
Accounting Standards Codification<FONT style="font-family: Symbol">&#212;</FONT> (ASC)&nbsp;Update No.&nbsp;2009-17, <I>Consolidations (Topic 810) &#151;
Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities</I>, which
formally codifies FASB Statement No.&nbsp;167, <I>Amendments to FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;46(R). </I>Update No.
2009-17 and Statement No.&nbsp;167 amend Interpretation No.&nbsp;46(R), <I>Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities</I>, to require that an enterprise perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise&#146;s
variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE. The analysis identifies the
primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both 1) the power to direct activities of a
VIE that most significantly impact the entity&#146;s economic performance and 2) the obligation to
absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Update No.&nbsp;2009-17
eliminated the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of
a VIE and requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary. We
are required to adopt Update No.&nbsp;2009-17 for our first quarter ending March&nbsp;31, 2010. We do not
believe the adoption of Update No.&nbsp;2009-17 will have a significant impact on our future results of
operations or financial position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We account for investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant
influence under the equity method if we hold 50&nbsp;percent or less of the voting stock and the entity
is not a variable interest entity in which we are the primary beneficiary. We record these
investments initially at cost, and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of the earnings
or losses of the investee, including all adjustments similar to those made in preparing
consolidated financial statements. We account for investments in entities over which we do not have
the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method of accounting.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the first quarter of 2008, we completed the divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses. Our
operating results for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 include the results of these businesses
through the date of separation. Our operating results for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 include
a full year of results of these businesses. Refer to <I>Note F &#151; Divestitures </I>for a description of
these business divestitures.

2009 in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations, and increased our associated
litigation-related reserves in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December&nbsp;31,
2009. We paid $1.000&nbsp;billion, consisting of $800&nbsp;million of cash on hand and $200&nbsp;million borrowed
from our revolving credit facility, during the first quarter of 2010 and will satisfy the remaining
obligation on or before January&nbsp;3, 2011. We posted a $745&nbsp;million letter of credit under our
revolving credit facility as collateral for the remaining payment, which reduces availability under
the facility by the same amount. We intend to fund the remaining payment with cash generated from
operations. In addition, during the first half of 2011, $1.750
billion of our outstanding debt obligations, as well as
our revolving credit facility, will mature. We expect to refinance
the majority of our 2011 debt maturities and revolving credit
facility by mid-2010. Refer to <I>Note L &#151; Commitments and

settlement  and our debt obligations.</DIV>

Borrowings and Credit Arrangements, and Note L &#151; Commitments and Contingencies </I>for more

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes
estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the
reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may
differ from these estimates.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Cash and Cash Equivalents</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We record cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets at cost, which approximates
fair value. We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three
months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We record available-for-sale investments at fair value and exclude unrealized gains and temporary
losses on available-for-sale securities from earnings, reporting such gains and losses, net of tax,
as a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity, until realized. We compute realized gains and
losses on sales of available-for-sale securities based on the average cost method, adjusted for any
other-than-temporary declines in fair value. We record held-to-maturity securities at amortized
cost and adjust for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. We classify
investments in debt securities or equity securities that have a readily determinable fair value
that we purchase and hold principally for selling them in the near term as trading securities. All
of our cash investments as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 had maturity dates at date of purchase of
less than three months and, accordingly, we have classified them as cash and cash equivalents in
our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Concentrations of Credit Risk</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instrument contracts and accounts and
notes receivable. Our investment policy limits exposure to concentrations of credit risk and
changes in market conditions. Counterparties to financial instruments expose us to credit-related
losses in the event of nonperformance. We transact our financial instruments with a diversified
group of major financial institutions and actively monitor outstanding positions to limit our
credit exposure.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We provide credit, in the normal course of business, to hospitals, healthcare agencies, clinics,

potential credit losses. We are not dependent on any single institution and no single customer
accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2009, 2008 or 2007.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Revenue Recognition</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We generate revenue primarily from the sale of single-use medical devices, and present revenue net
of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations. We consider revenue to be realized or
realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales
arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price is fixed or
determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. We generally meet these criteria at the
time of shipment, unless a consignment arrangement exists or we are required to provide additional
services. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, or implant,
which indicates that the sale is complete. For our other transactions, we recognize revenue when
our products are delivered and risk of loss transfers to the customer, provided there are no
substantive remaining performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer
acceptance, and provided we can form an estimate for sales returns. For multiple-element
arrangements, where the sale of devices is combined with future service obligations, as with our
LATITUDE<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> Patient Management System, we defer revenue on the undelivered element based on verifiable objective
evidence of fair value and using the residual method of allocation, and recognize the associated
revenue over the related service period.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired
products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the
amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow
customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings; for these
transactions, we defer recognition of revenue based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be
returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as
a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current. We estimate rebates for
products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of
expected future rebates. If we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably, we record a
liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered. We have entered certain agreements with group
purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices. We
recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed
above.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Warranty Obligations</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on historical experience.
We record a liability equal to the costs to repair or otherwise satisfy the claim as cost of
products sold at the time the product sale occurs. Factors that affect our warranty liability
include the number of units sold, the historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the
cost per claim. We assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities on a quarterly basis
and adjust the amounts as necessary. Changes in our product warranty obligations during 2009 and
2008 consisted of the following (in millions):

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We state inventories at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market. We base our provisions for
excess and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant
change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may
result in recording additional provisions for excess and obsolete inventory in the future. The
industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new
product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in
product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our
estimates related to excess and obsolete inventory.

contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. We base the fair value of identifiable
intangible assets and purchased research and development on detailed valuations that use
information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management&#146;s best estimates of
inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate any excess purchase price
over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill.
The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated cash flows and discount rates,

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our purchased research and development represents the value of acquired in-process projects that
have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date
of acquisition. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects
is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic
region. Through December&nbsp;31, 2008 we expensed the value attributable to these in-process projects
at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accounting standards effective through that date.
As discussed above, as of January&nbsp;1, 2009, we adopted FASB Statement No.&nbsp;141(R), <I>Business
Combinations </I>(codified within ASC Topic 805, <I>Business Combinations</I>), a replacement for Statement
No.&nbsp;141. Statement No.&nbsp;141(R) also superseded FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;4, <I>Applicability of FASB
Statement No.&nbsp;2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method</I>, which required
research and development assets acquired in a business combination that had no alternative future
use to be measured at their fair values and expensed at the acquisition date. Statement No.&nbsp;141(R)
(Topic 805) requires that purchased research and development acquired in a business combination be
recognized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the
associated research and development efforts. During 2009, we did not consummate any material
business combinations. For any future business combinations that we enter, we will recognize
purchased research and development as an intangible asset.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, we record certain costs associated with strategic alliances as purchased research and
development. Our adoption of Statement No.&nbsp;141(R) (Topic 805) did not change this policy with
respect to asset purchases.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development.
This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an
in-process project over its useful life and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a
present value. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected
market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share. In arriving
at the value of the in-process projects, we consider, among other factors: the in-process projects&#146;
stage of completion; the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date; the costs
already incurred; the projected costs to complete; the contribution of core technologies and other
acquired assets; the expected introduction date; and the estimated useful life of the technology.
We base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the
time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors. For the in-process projects
acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions, we used risk-adjusted discount rates of 34
percent in 2008 and 19&nbsp;percent in 2007 to discount our projected cash flows. We believe that the
estimated in-process research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the
date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects. However,
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner, we may not realize the
financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisition as a whole.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We record intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives.
We use a straight-line method of amortization, unless a method that better reflects the pattern in
which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be
reliably determined. The approximate useful lives for amortization of our intangible assets is as
follows: patents and licenses, two to 20&nbsp;years; definite-lived core and developed technology, five
to 25&nbsp;years; customer relationships, five to 25&nbsp;years; other intangible assets, various.

change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset, a product
recall, or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If an impairment indicator exists, we
test the intangible asset for recoverability. For purposes of the recoverability test, we group
our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of
identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other
assets and liabilities. If the carrying value of the intangible asset (asset group) exceeds the
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible
asset (asset group), we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period
identified. To test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we calculate the fair
value of these assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values.
If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the
carrying value down to the fair value.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future
cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. In determining
our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and
assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the
asset (asset group). The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount
rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of
impairment. See <I>Note E &#151; Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets </I>for more information related to
impairment of intangible assets during 2009, 2008 and 2007.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We test our April 1 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or
more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may
exist. In performing the assessment, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under ASC Topic
350, <I>Intangibles-Goodwill and Other </I>(formerly FASB Statement No.&nbsp;142, <I>Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets). </I>The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as
defined, to the fair value of these units. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit
level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred
to as a component. We determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments,
and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete
financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating
results of that component. We aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar
economic characteristics. For our April&nbsp;1, 2009 annual impairment assessment, we identified our
reporting units to be our six U.S. operating segments, which in aggregate make up the U.S.
reportable segment, and our four international operating segments. When allocating goodwill from
business combinations to our reporting units, we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we
expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition. In addition,
for purposes of performing our annual goodwill impairment test, assets and liabilities, including
corporate assets, which relate to a reporting unit&#146;s operations, and would be considered in
determining its fair value, are allocated to the individual reporting units. We allocate assets and
liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit, but from which the reporting unit
benefits, based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we used only the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow
(DCF)&nbsp;method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these
after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this
method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the
income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using
the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our
reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the
market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets
within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the
income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is
available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the
amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate
discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our
most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value
growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our
DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units.
We use estimates of market participant risk-adjusted weighted-average
costs of capital (WACC)&nbsp;as a basis for determining the
discount rates to apply to our reporting units&#146; future expected cash flows.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step
of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step
of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit&#146;s goodwill to
its carrying value. If we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance
of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated,
we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and
disclose that the amount is an estimate. We would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate
in subsequent reporting periods, once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the fourth quarter of 2008, the decline in our stock price and our market capitalization
created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance. Therefore, we performed an
interim impairment test and recorded a $2.613&nbsp;billion goodwill impairment charge associated with
our acquisition of Guidant Corporation. As a result of economic conditions and the related increase
in volatility in the equity and credit markets, which became more pronounced starting in the fourth
quarter of 2008, our estimated risk-adjusted WACC increased 150 basis points from 9.5&nbsp;percent
during our 2008 second quarter annual goodwill impairment assessment to 11.0&nbsp;percent during our
2008 fourth quarter interim impairment assessment. This change, along with reductions in market
demand for products in our U.S. Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM)&nbsp;reporting unit relative to our
assumptions at the time of the Guidant acquisition, were the key factors contributing to the
impairment charge. Our estimated market participant WACC decreased 50 basis points from 11.0
percent during our 2008 fourth quarter interim impairment assessment to 10.5&nbsp;percent during our
2009 second quarter annual goodwill impairment assessment, and our other significant assumptions
remained largely consistent. Our 2009 goodwill impairment test did not identify any reporting units
whose carrying values exceeded the calculated fair values.

reduced valuations; a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological
environment of an investee; or a significant doubt about an investee&#146;s ability to continue as a
going concern. If we identify an impairment indicator, we will estimate the fair value of the
investment and compare it to its carrying value. Our estimation of fair value considers all
available financial information related to the investee, including valuations based on recent
third-party equity investments in the investee. If the fair value of the investment is less than
its carrying value, the investment is impaired and we make a determination as to whether the
impairment is other-than-temporary. We deem impairment to be other-than-temporary unless we have
the ability and intent to hold an investment for a period sufficient for a market recovery up to
the carrying value of the investment. Further, evidence must indicate that the carrying value of
the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period. For other-than-temporary impairments, we
recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment&#146;s carrying value and its
fair value. Impairment losses on our investments are included in other, net in our consolidated

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We base our discount rate on the rates of return available on high-quality bonds with maturities
approximating the expected period over which benefits will be paid. The rate of compensation
increase is based on historical and expected rate increases. We review external data and historical
trends in health care costs to determine health care cost trend rate assumptions. We base our rate
of expected return on plan assets on historical experience, our investment guidelines and

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our investment policy with respect to these plans is to maximize the ability to meet plan
liabilities while minimizing the need to make future contributions to the plans. Plan assets are
invested primarily in domestic equity securities and debt securities.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We also sponsor a voluntary 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan for eligible employees. We match
employee contributions equal to 200&nbsp;percent for employee contributions up to two percent of
employee compensation, and fifty percent for employee contributions greater than two percent, but
not exceeding six percent, of pre-tax employee compensation. Total expense for our matching
contributions to the plan was $71&nbsp;million in 2009, $63&nbsp;million in 2008, and $64&nbsp;million in 2007.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with our acquisition of Guidant, we previously sponsored the Guidant Employee Savings
and Stock Ownership Plan, which allowed for employee contributions of a percentage of pre-tax
earnings, up to established federal limits. Our matching contributions to the plan were in the form
of shares of stock, allocated from the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). Refer to <I>Note N &#151;
Stock Ownership Plans </I>for more information on the ESOP. Effective June&nbsp;1, 2008, this plan was
merged into our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan, described above. Prior to this merger, expense for
our matching contributions to the plan was $12&nbsp;million in 2008 and $23&nbsp;million in 2007.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Sales of the PROMUS<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> everolimus-eluting stent system represented approximately eight percent of our
total net sales in 2009. We are currently reliant on Abbott Laboratories for our supply of
everolimus-eluting stent systems in the U.S. and Japan. Our supply agreement with Abbott for
everolimus-eluting stent systems in these regions extends through the end of the second quarter of
2012. At present, we believe that our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems from Abbott and
our current launch plans for our next-generation internally-manufactured everolimus-eluting stent
system in these regions is sufficient to meet customer demand. However, any production or capacity
issues that affect Abbott&#146;s manufacturing capabilities or our process for forecasting, ordering and
receiving shipments may impact the ability to increase or decrease our level of supply in a timely
manner; therefore, our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott may not
align with customer demand, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. In the
fourth quarter of 2009, we launched our internally developed and manufactured next-generation
everolimus-eluting stent system, our PROMUS<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> Element&#153; stent system, in our EMEA region and certain
Inter-Continental countries, and expect to launch this product in the U.S. and Japan in mid-2012.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Further, the price we pay for our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems from Abbott is
determined by contracts with Abbott and is based, in part, on previously fixed estimates of
Abbott&#146;s manufacturing costs for everolimus-eluting stent systems and third-party reports of our
average selling price of these stent systems. Amounts paid pursuant to this pricing arrangement are
subject to a retroactive adjustment approximately every two years based on Abbott&#146;s actual costs to
manufacture these stent systems for us and our average selling price of everolimus-eluting stent
systems supplied to us by Abbott.</DIV>

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are
exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these
risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments,
and operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We recognize all
derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair value in
accordance with ASC Topic 815, <I>Derivatives and Hedging </I>(formerly FASB Statement No.&nbsp;133, <I>Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities</I>). In accordance with Topic 815, for those
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the hedging
instrument must be designated, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash
flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. The accounting for changes in
the fair value (i.e. gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been
designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging
relationship. Our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings or cash flows to material
risk, as gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the item being
hedged. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and we do not have
any non-derivative instruments that are designated as hedging instruments pursuant to Topic 815.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>Currency Hedging</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are exposed to currency risk consisting primarily of foreign currency denominated monetary
assets and liabilities, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third party
transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We manage our exposure to changes in
foreign currency on a consolidated basis to take advantage of offsetting transactions and balances.
We use both derivative instruments (currency forward and option contracts), and non-derivatives
(primarily European manufacturing operations) to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows
associated with these foreign currency denominated balances and transactions will be adversely
affected by currency exchange rate changes.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Designated Foreign Currency Hedges</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">All of our designated currency hedge contracts outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and December&nbsp;31,
2008 were cash flow hedges under Topic 815 intended to protect the U.S. dollar value of our
forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions. We record the effective portion of any change
in the fair value of foreign currency cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income (OCI)&nbsp;until
the related third-party transaction occurs. Once the related third-party transaction occurs, we
reclassify the effective portion of any related gain or loss on the foreign currency cash flow
hedge to earnings. In the event the hedged forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes
probable that it will not occur, we would reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related
cash flow hedge to earnings at that time. We had currency derivative instruments designated as cash
flow hedges outstanding in the contract amount of $2.760&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $2.587
billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We recognized net gains of $4&nbsp;million in earnings on our cash flow hedges during 2009, as compared
to net losses of $67&nbsp;million during 2008. All currency cash flow hedges outstanding as of December
31, 2009 mature within 36&nbsp;months. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, $44&nbsp;million of net losses, net of tax,
were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)&nbsp;to recognize the effective portion
of the fair value of any currency derivative instruments that are, or previously were, designated
as foreign currency cash flow hedges, as compared to net losses of $6&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31,
2008. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, $36&nbsp;million of net losses, net of tax, may be reclassified to
earnings within the next twelve months.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The success of our hedging program depends, in part, on forecasts of transaction activity in
various currencies (primarily Japanese yen, Euro, British pound sterling, Australian dollar and
Canadian dollar).

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We may experience unanticipated currency exchange gains or losses to the extent
that there are differences between forecasted and actual activity during periods of currency
volatility. In addition, changes in currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions
may impact our earnings and cash flows.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2009, we directed our Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA)&nbsp;sales offices to converge differing
operating structures to a consistent limited risk distribution sales structure beginning in the
third quarter of 2010. This change is expected to impact our EMEA transaction flow and effectively
move our foreign exchange risk from third-party sales to intercompany sales. While the convergence
is not expected to have a significant impact on the magnitude of foreign currency exposure, we
de-designated certain cash flow hedges of third-party sales. We reclassified net losses of $5
million from AOCI to current earnings during 2009 related to these de-designated cash flow hedges.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We use currency forward contracts as a part of our strategy to manage exposure related to foreign
currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and certain short-term earnings and cash flow
exposures related to our Japanese operations that do not qualify for hedge accounting under Topic
815. These currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment
hedges under Topic 815; are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to earnings; and
are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposures, generally one to six
months. We had currency derivative instruments not designated as hedges under Topic 815 outstanding
in the contract amount of $1.982&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $1.809&nbsp;billion as of December
31, 2008.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings, partially offset by U.S. dollar
cash investments. We use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow
exposure to changes in interest rates by converting floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt or
fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We designate these derivative instruments either as fair value or cash flow hedges under Topic 815.
We record changes in the value of fair value hedges in interest expense, which is generally offset
by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligation. Interest payments made or received
related to our interest rate derivative instruments are included in interest expense. We record the
effective portion of any change in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow
hedges as unrealized gains or losses in OCI, net of tax, until the hedged cash flow occurs, at
which point the effective portion of any gain or loss is reclassified to earnings. We record the
ineffective portion of our cash flow hedges in interest expense. In the event the hedged cash flow
does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we would reclassify the amount of
any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge to interest expense at that time.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, as compared to
the notional amount of $4.900&nbsp;billion outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. These interest rate
derivative instruments fixed the interest rate on our expected LIBOR-indexed floating-rate loans
and were designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with ASC Topic 815. During 2009, these
interest rate derivative instruments either matured as scheduled or were terminated in connection
with the prepayment of our bank term loan, discussed further in <I>Note I &#151; Borrowings and Credit
Arrangements</I>. We recognized $27&nbsp;million of losses within interest expense due to the early
termination of these interest rate contracts.

Topic 815, we are amortizing the gains and losses of these derivative instruments upon termination
into earnings over the term of the hedged debt. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the carrying amount of
certain of our senior notes included $3&nbsp;million of unamortized gains and $8&nbsp;million of unamortized
losses related to the fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts. We recognized approximately $2
million of interest expense during 2009 related to these derivative instruments. In addition, as
of December&nbsp;31, 2009, $11&nbsp;million of net gains are recorded in AOCI related to terminated
floating-to-fixed treasury locks. We recognized approximately $2&nbsp;million as a reduction in interest
expense related to these derivative instruments during 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2009, we recognized in earnings $70&nbsp;million of net losses, inclusive of the $27&nbsp;million of
interest rate contract termination losses described above, related to our interest rate derivative
instruments, including previously terminated interest rate derivative contracts. During 2008, we
recognized in earnings $20&nbsp;million of net losses related to our interest rate contracts. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2009, $7&nbsp;million of net gains, net of tax, are recorded in AOCI to recognize the
effective portion of our interest rate derivative instruments, as compared to $20&nbsp;million of net
losses as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, an immaterial amount of net gains, net of

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We do not have significant concentrations of credit risk arising from our derivative financial
instruments, whether from an individual counterparty or group of counterparties. We reduce our
concentration of counterparty credit risk on our derivative instruments by limiting acceptable
counterparties to a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit
ratings, limiting the amount of credit exposure to each counterparty, and by actively monitoring
their credit ratings and outstanding positions on an on-going basis. Furthermore, none of our
derivative transactions are subject to collateral or other security arrangements and do not contain
provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agency.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We also employ master netting arrangements that reduce our counterparty payment settlement risk on
any given maturity date to the net amount of any receipts or payments due between us and the
counterparty financial institution. Thus, the maximum loss due to credit risk by counterparty is
limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts net of any unrealized losses should any of these
counterparties fail to perform as contracted. Although these protections do not eliminate
concentrations of credit, as a result of the above considerations, we do not consider the risk of
counterparty default to be significant.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Topic 815 requires all derivative instruments to be recognized at their fair values as either
assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. We determine the fair value of our derivative
instruments using the framework prescribed by Topic 820, <I>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</I>
(formerly FASB Statement No.&nbsp;157, Fair Value Measurements), by considering the estimated amount we
would receive to sell or transfer these instruments at the reporting date and by taking into
account current interest rates, currency exchange rates, the creditworthiness of the counterparty
for assets, and our creditworthiness for liabilities. In certain instances, we may utilize
financial models to measure fair value. Generally, we use inputs that include quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
liabilities in markets that are not active; other observable inputs for the asset or liability; and
inputs derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other
means. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we have classified all of our derivative assets and liabilities
within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy prescribed by Topic 820, as discussed below, because
these observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of our derivative
instruments.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On a recurring basis, we measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value
based upon quoted market prices, where available. Where quoted market prices or other observable
inputs are not available, we apply valuation techniques to estimate fair value. Topic 820
establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The
categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is
based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. The
three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:

$346&nbsp;million of cash invested in short-term time deposits, and $113&nbsp;million in interest bearing and
non-interest bearing bank accounts.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We hold certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in
periods subsequent to initial recognition. The fair value of a cost method investment is not
estimated if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant
adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. The aggregate carrying amount of our cost
method investments was $58&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $68&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2008.
As of December&nbsp;31 2009, we had no material assets or liabilities measured at fair value on either a
recurring or non-recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2009, we recorded $26&nbsp;million of losses to adjust certain cost method investments and
intangible assets to fair value because we deemed the decline in the values of the assets to be
other-than-temporary. Of these losses, $14&nbsp;million is related to certain of our cost method
investments. These investments fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, due to the use of
significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value, as the investments are in privately held
entities without quoted market prices. To determine the fair value of these investments, we used
all financial information available to us related to the entities, including information based on
recent third-party equity investments in, and financial statements of, these entities. The
remaining $12&nbsp;million of the loss is related to certain of our intangible assets, which we wrote
down to their estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360, <I>Property, Plant
and Equipment </I>(formerly FASB Statement No.&nbsp;144, <I>Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets).</I>

$6.184&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. The change in fair value reflects debt prepayments of
$2.825&nbsp;billion during 2009, partially offset by the issuance of $2.0&nbsp;billion of senior notes and an
increase in the fair market value of our remaining debt obligations. Refer to <I>Note I &#151; Borrowings

Interventional Systems, Inc., a developer of stents used in the treatment of stenotic lesions in
the carotid arteries. We issued approximately five million shares of our common stock valued at $90

approximately $40&nbsp;million, to acquire the remaining interests of EndoTex. In addition, we may be

Medical Technologies, Inc. Remon is a development-stage company focused on creating communication
technology for medical device applications. We paid approximately $70&nbsp;million in cash, net of cash
acquired, in addition to our previous investments of $3&nbsp;million, to acquire the remaining interests
of Remon. We may also be required to make future payments contingent upon the achievement of
certain performance-related milestones. The acquisition was intended to expand our sensor and

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Certain of our acquisitions involve the payment of contingent consideration. Payment of the
additional consideration is generally contingent on the acquired company reaching certain
performance milestones, including attaining specified revenue levels, achieving product development
targets or obtaining regulatory approvals. In August&nbsp;2007, we entered an agreement to amend our
2004 merger agreement with the principal former shareholders of Advanced Bionics Corporation.
Previously, we were obligated to pay future consideration contingent primarily on the achievement
of future performance milestones. The amended agreement provided a new schedule of consolidated,
fixed payments, consisting of $650&nbsp;million that was paid in 2008, and a final $500&nbsp;million payment,
paid in 2009. We received cash proceeds of $150&nbsp;million in 2008 related to our sale of a
controlling interest in the Auditory business acquired with Advanced Bionics, and received
additional proceeds of $40&nbsp;million in 2009 related to the sale of our remaining interest in
this business. Refer to <I>Note F &#151; Divestitures </I>to our consolidated financial statements contained
in Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report for a discussion of this transaction. During 2009, including the
$500&nbsp;million payment to the former shareholders of Advanced Bionics, we made total payments of $523
million related to prior period acquisitions. During 2008, we paid $675&nbsp;million related to prior
period acquisitions, consisting primarily of the $650&nbsp;million fixed payment made to the principal
former shareholders of Advanced Bionics. During 2007, we paid $248&nbsp;million for acquisition-related
payments associated primarily with Advanced Bionics.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration
(undiscounted)&nbsp;that we could be required to make associated with our prior acquisitions is
approximately $640&nbsp;million. The estimated cumulative specified revenue level associated with these
maximum future contingent payments is approximately $800&nbsp;million.

Guidant Corporation&#146;s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, Abbott agreed to pay us a milestone
payment of $250 million upon receipt of
approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell an

everolimus-eluting stent in the U.S. In July 2008,
Abbott received FDA approval and launched its
<font style="white-space: nowrap">XIENCE V&#174;</font> everolimus-eluting coronary stent system in the U.S., and paid us
$250 million, which we recorded as a gain in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Under the

upon receipt of an approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW)
to market the <font style="white-space: nowrap">XIENCE V&#174;</font> stent system in Japan. The MHLW approved the XIENCE V&#174; stent
system in the first quarter in 2010 and we subsequently received the milestone payment from Abbott,

development. Our adoption of Statement No.&nbsp;141(R) (Topic 805) did not change this policy with
respect to asset purchases. In accordance with this policy, we recorded purchased research and
development charges of $21&nbsp;million in 2009, associated with entering certain licensing and
development arrangements. Since the technology purchases did not involve the transfer of processes
or outputs as defined by Statement No.&nbsp;141(R) (Topic 805), the transactions did not qualify as
business combinations.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2008, we recorded $43&nbsp;million of purchased research and development charges, including $17
million associated with our acquisition of Labcoat, Ltd., $8&nbsp;million attributable to our
acquisition of CryoCor, Inc., and $18&nbsp;million associated with entering certain licensing and
development arrangements. The $17&nbsp;million of in-process research and development associated with
our acquisition of Labcoat, Ltd. relates to their in-process coating technology for drug-eluting
stents. The $8&nbsp;million of purchased research and development associated with CryoCor relates to
their cryogenic technology for use in the treatment of atrial fibrillation.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2007, we recorded $85&nbsp;million of purchased research and development, including $75&nbsp;million
associated with our acquisition of Remon Medical Technologies, Inc., $13&nbsp;million resulting from the
application of equity method accounting for one of our strategic investments, and $12&nbsp;million
associated with payments made for certain early-stage CRM technologies. Additionally, in June&nbsp;2007,
we terminated our product development agreement with Aspect Medical Systems relating to brain
monitoring technology that Aspect has been developing to aid the diagnosis and treatment of
depression, Alzheimer&#146;s disease and other neurological conditions. As a result, we recognized a
credit to purchased research and development of approximately $15&nbsp;million during 2007, representing
future payments that we would have been obligated to make prior to the termination of the
agreement. We do not expect the termination of the agreement to impact our future operations or
cash flows materially.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The $75&nbsp;million of in-process research and development acquired with Remon relates to their
pressure-sensing system development project, which we intend to combine with our existing CRM
devices. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we estimate that the total cost to complete the development
project is between $75&nbsp;million and $80&nbsp;million. We expect to launch devices using pressure-sensing
technology in 2013 in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries, in the U.S. in 2016,
and Japan in 2017, subject to regulatory approvals. We expect material net cash inflows from such
products to commence in 2016, following the launch of this technology in the U.S.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Goodwill Impairment Charges</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the fourth quarter of 2008, the decline in our stock price and our market capitalization
created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance. Therefore, we performed an
interim impairment test and recorded a $2.613&nbsp;billion goodwill impairment charge associated with
our acquisition of Guidant Corporation. As a result of economic conditions and the related increase
in volatility in the equity and credit markets, which became more pronounced starting in the fourth
quarter of 2008, our estimated risk-adjusted WACC increased 150 basis points from 9.5&nbsp;percent
during our 2008 second quarter annual goodwill impairment assessment to 11.0&nbsp;percent during our
2008 fourth quarter interim impairment assessment. This change, along with reductions in market
demand for products in our U.S. CRM reporting unit relative to our assumptions at the time of the
Guidant acquisition, were the key factors contributing to the impairment charge. At the time of the
Guidant acquisition in 2006, we expected average U.S. net sales growth rates in the mid-teens;
however, due to changes in end market demand, we reduced our estimates of average U.S. CRM sales
growth rates to the mid-to-high single digits. Our estimated market participant WACC decreased 50
basis points from 11.0&nbsp;percent during our 2008 fourth quarter interim impairment assessment to 10.5
percent during our 2009 second quarter annual goodwill impairment assessment, and our other
significant assumptions remained largely consistent. Our 2009 goodwill impairment test did not
identify any reporting units whose carrying values exceeded implied fair values. See <I>Note A &#151;
Significant Accounting Policies </I>for further discussion of our policies and methodologies related to
goodwill impairment testing.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Other Intangible Asset Impairment Charges</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2009, we recorded other intangible asset impairment charges of $12&nbsp;million, associated
primarily with lower than anticipated market penetration of one of our Urology technology
offerings.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2008, we reduced our future revenue and cash flow forecasts associated with certain of our
Peripheral Interventions-related intangible assets, primarily as a result of a recall of one of our
products. Therefore, we tested these intangible assets for impairment, in accordance with our
accounting policies, and determined that these assets were impaired, resulting in a $131&nbsp;million
charge to write down these intangible assets to their fair value. Further, as a result of
significantly lower than forecasted sales of certain of our Urology products, due to lower than
anticipated market penetration, we determined that certain of our Urology-related intangible assets
were impaired, resulting in a $46&nbsp;million charge to write down these intangible assets to their
fair value.

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2007, we determined that our Auditory, Cardiac Surgery, Vascular Surgery, Venous Access, and
Fluid Management businesses, as well as our TriVascular Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR)&nbsp;program,
were no longer strategic to our on-going operations. Therefore, we initiated the process of selling
these businesses in 2007, and completed their sale in the first quarter of 2008, as discussed
below. We received gross proceeds of approximately $1.3&nbsp;billion from these divestitures. Management
committed to a plan to sell each of these businesses in 2007 and, pursuant to ASC Topic 360, we
adjusted the carrying value of the disposal groups to their fair value, less cost to sell (if lower
than the carrying value) during 2007, and recognized a related loss of $560&nbsp;million in our
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The combined 2007 revenues associated with the disposal groups were $553&nbsp;million, or seven percent
of our net sales.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Auditory</I></DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In August&nbsp;2007, we entered an agreement to amend our 2004 merger agreement with the principal
former shareholders of Advanced Bionics Corporation. The acquisition of Advanced Bionics included
potential earnout payments that were contingent primarily on the achievement of future performance
milestones, with certain milestones tied to profitability. The amended agreement provided for a new
schedule of consolidated, fixed payments to the former Advanced Bionics shareholders, consisting of
$650&nbsp;million that was paid upon closing in January&nbsp;2008, and $500&nbsp;million paid in March&nbsp;2009. These
payments represent the final payments made to Advanced Bionics. Following the approval by the
former shareholders in 2007, we accrued the fair value of these amounts, as the payment of this
consideration was determinable beyond a reasonable doubt. The fair value of these payments,
determined to be $1.115&nbsp;billion, was recorded as an increase to goodwill.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In conjunction with the amended merger agreement, in January&nbsp;2008, we completed the sale of a
controlling interest in our Auditory business and drug pump development program, acquired with
Advanced Bionics in 2004, to entities affiliated with the principal former shareholders of Advanced
Bionics for an aggregate purchase price of $150&nbsp;million in cash. To adjust the carrying value of
the disposal group to its fair value, less costs to sell, we recorded a loss of approximately $367
million in 2007, representing primarily a write-down of goodwill. Under the terms of the agreement,
we retained an equity interest in the limited liability company formed for purposes of operating
the Auditory business and, in 2009, received proceeds of $40&nbsp;million from the sale of this
investment.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In January&nbsp;2008, we completed the sale of our Cardiac Surgery and Vascular Surgery businesses to
the Getinge Group for net cash proceeds of approximately $700&nbsp;million. To adjust the carrying value
of the Cardiac Surgery and Vascular Surgery disposal group to its fair value, less costs to sell,
we recorded a loss of $193&nbsp;million in 2007, representing primarily the write-down of goodwill. We
acquired the Cardiac Surgery business in April&nbsp;2006 with our acquisition of Guidant Corporation and
acquired the Vascular Surgery business in 1995.</DIV>

$400&nbsp;million. We did not adjust the carrying value of the Fluid Management and Venous Access
disposal group as of December&nbsp;31, 2007, because the fair value of the disposal group, less costs to
sell, exceeded its carrying value. We recorded a gain of $234&nbsp;million during 2008 associated with
this transaction. We acquired the Fluid Management business as part of our acquisition of Schneider
Worldwide in 1998. The Venous Access business was previously a component of our Oncology business.</DIV>

We have historically entered a significant number of alliances with publicly traded and privately
held entities in order to broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our
reach into existing and new markets. During 2007, in connection with our strategic initiatives, we
announced our intent to sell the majority of our investment portfolio in order to monetize those
investments determined to be non-strategic.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In June&nbsp;2008, we signed definitive agreements with Saints Capital and Paul Capital Partners to sell
the majority of our investments in, and notes receivable from, certain publicly traded and
privately held entities for gross proceeds of approximately $140&nbsp;million. In connection with these
agreements, we received proceeds of $95&nbsp;million in 2008, and an additional $45&nbsp;million in 2009. In
addition, we received proceeds of $46&nbsp;million in 2009 and $54&nbsp;million in 2008 from other
transactions to monetize certain other non-strategic investments.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2009, we recorded gains of $23&nbsp;million and other-than-temporary impairments of $14&nbsp;million
associated with our investment portfolio. Gains and losses associated with our investments and
notes receivable are recorded in other, net within our consolidated statements of operations. In
addition, we recorded losses of $6&nbsp;million associated with our equity method investments. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2009, we held investments with a book value of $8&nbsp;million that we accounted for under
the equity method of accounting.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2008, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments of $130&nbsp;million associated with our
investment portfolio, and gains of $52&nbsp;million related to the sale of non-strategic investments.
The other-than-temporary impairments included $127&nbsp;million related to non-strategic investments and
notes receivable which we had sold or intended to sell, and $3&nbsp;million related to our strategic
equity investments. We also recognized other costs of $5&nbsp;million associated with the Saints and
Paul agreements. We recorded losses of $10&nbsp;million, reported in other, net, in our accompanying
consolidated statements of operations associated with our equity method investments. As of December
31, 2008, we held investments with a book value of $45&nbsp;million that we accounted for under the

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2007, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments of $119&nbsp;million related to our investments
and notes receivable, and recorded gains of $65&nbsp;million associated with the sale of equity
investments and collection of notes receivable. We recorded $13&nbsp;million of purchased research and
development associated with the initial application of the equity method of accounting to certain
investments in 2007. Other income (expense)&nbsp;associated with equity method adjustments in 2007 was
less than $1&nbsp;million in the aggregate.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We had notes receivable from certain portfolio companies of approximately $40&nbsp;million as of
December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $46&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. In addition, as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, we

consolidated balance sheets related to investments that were monetized in 2009 pursuant to our
definitive agreement with Saints.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Note H &#151; Restructuring-related Activities</B></DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On an on-going basis, we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the
markets in which we compete; and we continue to assess opportunities for improved operational
effectiveness and efficiency, and better alignment of expenses with revenues, while preserving our
ability to make the investments in quality, research and development projects, capital and our
people that are essential to our long-term success. As a result of these assessments, we have
undertaken various restructuring initiatives to focus our business, diversify and reprioritize our
product portfolio and redirect research and development and other spending toward higher payoff
products in order to enhance our growth potential. These initiatives are described below.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In October&nbsp;2007, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expense and head count
reduction plan (the 2007 Restructuring plan), which resulted in the elimination of approximately
2,300 positions worldwide. We are providing affected employees with severance packages,
outplacement services and other appropriate assistance and support. The plan is intended to bring
expenses in line with revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short- and long-term
shareholder value. Key activities under the plan include the restructuring of several businesses,
corporate functions and product franchises in order to better utilize resources, strengthen
competitive positions, and create a more simplified and efficient business model; the elimination,
suspension or reduction of spending on certain R&#038;D projects; and the transfer of certain production
lines among facilities. We initiated these activities in the fourth quarter of 2007. The transfer
of production lines contemplated under the 2007 Restructuring plan will continue throughout 2010;
all other major activities under the plan were completed as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We expect that the execution of this plan will result in total pre-tax expenses of approximately
$425&nbsp;million to $435&nbsp;million. We have recorded related costs of
$407&nbsp;million since the inception of the plan, and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges
and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. We
expect the plan to result in cash payments of approximately $375&nbsp;million to $385&nbsp;million, of which we have made payments of $330&nbsp;million to date. The
following provides a summary of our expected total costs associated with the plan by major type of
cost:</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2009, we made cash payments of approximately $100&nbsp;million associated with restructuring
initiatives pursuant to our 2007 Restructuring plan, which related to termination benefits,
production line transfer costs and other restructuring costs. We have made cumulative cash payments
of approximately $330&nbsp;million since we committed to the 2007 Restructuring plan. These payments
were made using cash generated from our operations. We expect to record the remaining costs
associated with the 2007 Restructuring plan through 2010, and make future cash payments throughout
2010 using cash generated from operations. In 2009, since the inception of our Plant Network
Optimization program, we have made associated cash payments of $12&nbsp;million. These payments were
made using cash generated from our operations. We expect to record the remaining costs associated
with the Plant Network Optimization
program through 2011, and make future cash payments through 2012 using cash generated from
operations.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The following is a rollforward of the liability associated with our restructuring initiatives,
since the inception of the respective plan, which is reported as a component of accrued expenses
included in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition to the amounts in the rollforward above, we have incurred cumulative charges of $142
million associated with retention incentives, asset write-offs, accelerated depreciation and
transfer costs pursuant to our 2007 Restructuring plan, and made cumulative cash payments of
approximately $64&nbsp;million associated with retention incentives and $29&nbsp;million associated with
transfer costs. We have also incurred cumulative charges of $18&nbsp;million associated with accelerated
depreciation and transfer costs pursuant to our Plant Network Optimization program and made
cumulative cash payments of $12&nbsp;million.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Further, on February&nbsp;6, 2010, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a series of
management changes and restructuring initiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to
strengthen and position us for long-term success. Key activities under the plan include the
integration of our Cardiovascular and CRM businesses, as well as the restructuring of certain other
businesses and corporate functions; the centralization of our R&#038;D organization; the re-alignment of
our international structure, and the reprioritization and diversification of our product portfolio,
in order to drive innovation, accelerate profitable growth and increase both accountability and
shareholder value. Activities under the 2010 Restructuring plan will be initiated in early 2010 and
are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2011. We estimate that the 2010
Restructuring plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $180&nbsp;million to $200
million, and that approximately $170&nbsp;million to $190&nbsp;million of these charges will result in future
cash outlays. We expect the execution of the plan will result in the elimination of approximately
1,000 to 1,300 positions by the end of 2011. The following provides a summary of our expected total
costs associated with the plan by major type of cost:</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2006, to finance the cash portion of our acquisition of Guidant Corporation, we borrowed a
$5.0&nbsp;billion five-year term loan and established a $2.0&nbsp;billion, five-year revolving credit
facility. Use of borrowings under the revolving credit facility is unrestricted and the borrowings
are unsecured. There were no amounts borrowed under this facility as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008.
We prepaid $1.0&nbsp;billion of the term loan during 2007, $1.175&nbsp;billion in 2008, and, in 2009, prepaid
$2.825&nbsp;billion, satisfying all remaining maturities under the term loan. There were no penalties or
premiums associated with these prepayments.</DIV>

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2009, we amended this agreement to increase flexibility under our financial covenants.
The amendment provided for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by
the amended agreement, through the credit agreement maturity in April&nbsp;2011, of up to $346&nbsp;million
in restructuring charges to support our expense reduction initiatives; an exclusion for any
litigation-related charges and credits until such items are paid or received; and an exclusion of
up to $1.137&nbsp;billion of any cash payments for litigation settlements or damage awards (net of any
litigation payments received), and all litigation-related cash payments (net of cash receipts)
related to amounts that were recorded in the financial statements before January&nbsp;1, 2009. In
addition, the agreement provided for an increase in interest rates on our term loan borrowings from
LIBOR plus 1.00&nbsp;percent to LIBOR plus 1.75&nbsp;percent, and increased the interest rate on unused
facilities from 0.175&nbsp;percent to 0.500&nbsp;percent.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of and through December&nbsp;31, 2009, we were in compliance with the required covenants. Our
inability to maintain these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our
credit facilities or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result
in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would grant such
waivers.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the amendment of the revolving credit facility agreement in 2009, we reduced
availability under our credit facility by $250&nbsp;million to $1.750&nbsp;billion. In 2008, we issued a
$717&nbsp;million surety bond backed by a $702&nbsp;million letter of credit under the revolving credit
facility, and $15&nbsp;million of cash to secure a damage award related to a patent infringement case
with Johnson &#038; Johnson described in <I>Note L &#151; Commitments and Contingencies. </I>In October&nbsp;2009, we
satisfied the related obligation of $716&nbsp;million using cash generated from operations. During the
first quarter of 2010, we reached an agreement to settle three patent disputes with Johnson &#038;
Johnson for $1.725&nbsp;billion, plus interest. We
paid $1.000&nbsp;billion, consisting of $800&nbsp;million of cash on hand and $200&nbsp;million borrowed from our
revolving credit facility, during the first quarter of 2010 and will satisfy the remaining
obligation on or before January&nbsp;3, 2011. We posted a $745&nbsp;million letter of credit under our
revolving credit facility as collateral for the remaining payment, reducing the availability under
our revolving credit facility by the same amount. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had outstanding
letters of credit of $123&nbsp;million, as compared to $819&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31,
2008, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers&#146;
compensation programs. The decrease is due primarily to the satisfaction of the Johnson &#038; Johnson
obligation discussed above, and subsequent termination of the associated $702&nbsp;million letter of
credit. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or
guarantees, and, as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, we had accrued the Johnson &#038; Johnson obligation.
Accordingly, we have not recognized a related liability for our outstanding letters of credit in
our consolidated balance sheets as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 or 2008 for the letters of credit. We
believe we will generate sufficient cash from operations to fund these payments without drawing on the
letters of credit.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Abbott Loan</I></DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2006, we also borrowed $900&nbsp;million from Abbott Laboratories. The loan from Abbott bears
interest at a fixed 4.0&nbsp;percent rate, payable semi-annually. The loan is subordinated to our
senior, unsecured, subsidiary indebtedness. We are permitted to prepay the Abbott loan prior to
maturity with no penalty or premium. We determined that an appropriate fair market interest rate on
the loan from Abbott was 5.25&nbsp;percent per annum. We recorded the loan at a discount of
approximately $50&nbsp;million at the inception of the loan and are recording interest at an imputed
rate of 5.25&nbsp;percent over the term of the loan. The remaining unamortized discount as of December
31, 2009 is $14&nbsp;million.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Senior Notes</I></DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We had senior notes outstanding of $5.050&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $3.050&nbsp;billion as of
December&nbsp;31, 2008. These notes are publicly registered securities, are redeemable prior to maturity
and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. Our senior notes are unsecured,
unsubordinated</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2006, we increased the interest rate payable on our November&nbsp;2015 Notes and November&nbsp;2035
Notes by 0.75&nbsp;percent to 6.25&nbsp;percent and 7.0&nbsp;percent, respectively, in connection with credit
ratings changes as a result of our acquisition of Guidant. Rating changes throughout 2007, 2008 and
2009 had no additional impact on the interest rates associated with our senior notes. Our $2.0
billion of senior notes issued in 2009 contain a change-in-control provision, which provides that
each holder of the senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a
price equal to 101&nbsp;percent of the aggregate repurchased principal, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if a rating event, as defined in the indenture, occurs as a result of a
change-in-control, as defined in the indenture. Any other credit rating changes may impact our
borrowing cost, but do not require us to repay any borrowings. Subsequent rating improvements may
result in a decrease in the adjusted interest rate to the extent that our lowest credit rating is
above BBB- or Baa3. The interest rates on our November&nbsp;2015 and November&nbsp;2035 Notes will be
permanently reinstated to the issuance rate if the lowest credit ratings assigned to these senior
notes is either A- or A3 or higher.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We maintain a $350&nbsp;million credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables. Use
of the borrowings is unrestricted. Borrowing availability under this facility changes based upon
the amount of eligible receivables, concentration of eligible receivables and other factors.
Certain significant changes in the quality of our receivables may require us to repay borrowings
immediately under the facility. The credit agreement required us to create a wholly owned entity,
which we consolidate. This entity purchases our U.S. trade accounts receivable and then borrows
from two third-party financial institutions using these receivables as collateral. The receivables
and related borrowings remain on our consolidated balance sheets because we have the right to
prepay any borrowings and effectively retain control over the receivables. Accordingly, pledged
receivables are included as trade accounts receivable, net, while the corresponding borrowings are
included as debt on our consolidated balance sheets. There were no amounts outstanding under this
facility as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Further, we have uncommitted credit facilities with two commercial Japanese banks that provide for
borrowings and promissory notes discounting of up to 18.5&nbsp;billion Japanese yen (translated to
approximately $200&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009). We discounted $194&nbsp;million of notes receivable
as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 at an average interest rate of 1.49&nbsp;percent, and $190&nbsp;million of notes

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we generated U.S. tax net operating loss, capital loss and tax credits,
the tax effect of which was $261&nbsp;million, as compared to $45&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. In
addition, we had foreign tax net operating loss carryforwards, the tax effect of which was
$312&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, as compared to $249&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. We plan
to carryback $210&nbsp;million of the tax attributes generated in the U.S. to prior years and
carryforward the remaining tax attributes which expect to expire periodically beginning in 2010.
After consideration of all positive and negative evidence, we believe that it is more likely than
not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, we established a
valuation allowance of $329&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $252&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31,
2008. The increase in the valuation allowance as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, as compared to December&nbsp;31,
2008, is attributable primarily to foreign net operating losses generated during the year. The

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of
December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had $1.038&nbsp;billion of gross
unrecognized tax benefits, of which a net  $885&nbsp;million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, we had $1.107
billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of
which a net $945&nbsp;million, if recognized, would affect our
effective tax rate.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign
jurisdictions. We have concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters through 2000 and substantially
all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters through 2001.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2009, we received the Revenue Agent&#146;s Report for our federal tax examination covering years
2004 and 2005, which contained proposed adjustments, related primarily to transfer pricing and
transaction-related issues. We agreed on certain adjustments and made associated payments of $64
million, inclusive of interest. We disagree with certain positions contained in the Report and
intend to contest these positions through applicable IRS and judicial procedures, as appropriate.
We also continue to disagree with and contest the significant proposed adjustment, related
primarily to the allocation of income between our US and foreign affiliates, contained in the
Revenue Agent&#146;s Report received in 2008 for Guidant&#146;s federal tax examination covering years 2001
through 2003. Although the final resolution associated with these matters is uncertain, we believe
that our income tax reserves are adequate and that the resolution will not have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2009, we received favorable foreign court decisions and resolved certain foreign matters.
As a result of these activities, we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by $20
million, inclusive of $7&nbsp;million of interest and penalties. In addition, statutes of limitations
expired in various foreign and state jurisdictions, as a result, decreased our reserve for
uncertain tax positions by $29&nbsp;million, inclusive of interest and penalties.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2009, we resolved certain litigation-related matters, as described in <I>Note L &#151; Commitments
and Contingencies</I>. Based on the outcome of the settlements, we have reassessed the reserve for
uncertain tax positions previously recorded on certain positions and, as a result, have decreased
our reserve by $22&nbsp;million, inclusive of $1&nbsp;million of interest.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">It is reasonably possible that within the next 12&nbsp;months we will resolve multiple issues including
transfer pricing, research and development credit and transactional related issues, with foreign,

unrecognized tax benefits of up to approximately $125&nbsp;million.

We had $299&nbsp;million accrued for gross interest and penalties as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $268
million as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. The increase in gross interest and penalties was a result of $63
million recognized in our consolidated statements of operations, offset by $32&nbsp;million reduction,
due primarily to payments
related to audit settlements and statute expirations. We recognized total interest and penalties
related to income taxes of $4&nbsp;million in 2008 and $76&nbsp;million in 2007.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. Physician
customers, particularly in interventional cardiology, have historically moved quickly to new
products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and
trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. However,
intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. Furthermore, appellate
courts can overturn lower court patent decisions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across
product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties.
In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related
proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently
drive settlement not only of individual cases, but also of a series of pending and potentially
related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically
sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial
court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are
difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in
other geographies. Several third parties have asserted that our current and former stent systems
infringe patents owned or licensed by them. We have similarly asserted that stent systems or other
products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us. Adverse outcomes in one
or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain stent products in
certain jurisdictions, or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have
a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In particular, although our recent settlements with Johnson &#038; Johnson resolved 17 litigation
matters, as discussed below, we continue to be involved in patent litigation with Johnson &#038; Johnson
relating to drug eluting stent delivery systems. We have each asserted that products of the other
infringe patents owned or exclusively licensed by each of us. Adverse outcomes in one or more of
these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on
our operating margins, financial position, results of operation or liquidity.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the normal course of business, product liability, securities and commercial claims are asserted
against us. Similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to
management at the present time. We are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability
claims, and maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims. The
absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to
unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. Product liability claims, product recalls, securities
litigation, and other legal proceedings in the future, regardless of their outcome, could have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In
addition, the medical device industry is the subject of numerous governmental investigations often
involving marketing and other business practices. These investigations

the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable. In accordance with ASC Topic 450,
<I>Contingencies </I>(formerly FASB Statement No.&nbsp;5, <I>Accounting for Contingencies), </I>we accrue
anticipated costs of settlement, damages losses for general product liability claims and, under
certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific
losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense
these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the
range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was $2.316&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31,
2009 and $1.089&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, and includes estimated costs of settlement,
damages and defense. The increase in our accrual is due primarily to 2009 charges of $1.736&nbsp;billion
associated with various litigation-related matters with Johnson &#038; Johnson, and $296&nbsp;million
associated with an agreement in principle reached with the U.S. Department of Justice, both matters
described below, partially offset by the payment of a $716&nbsp;million settlement related to a Johnson
&#038; Johnson matter, and $45&nbsp;million associated with the settlement of all outstanding litigation with
Bruce Saffran, both described below and accrued as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. In addition, during 2009,
we reduced previously recorded reserves associated with certain litigation-related matters
following certain favorable court rulings, resulting in a credit of $60&nbsp;million. We continue to
assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts that management believes will be paid
as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued in the
future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and our ability
to comply with our debt covenants

Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that our NIR&#174; stent infringes three claims of two
patents (the Fischell patents) owned by Cordis and seeking damages and injunctive relief. On May&nbsp;2,
2005, the District Court entered judgment that none of the three asserted claims was infringed,
although two of the claims were not invalid. The District Court also found the two patents
unenforceable for inequitable conduct. Cordis appealed the non-infringement finding of one claim in
one patent and the unenforceability of that patent. We cross appealed the finding that one of the
two claims was not invalid. Cordis did not appeal as to the second patent. On June&nbsp;29, 2006, the
Court of Appeals upheld the finding that the claim was not invalid, remanded the case to the
District Court for additional factual findings related to inequitable conduct, and did not address
the finding that the claim was not infringed. On August&nbsp;10, 2009, the District Court reversed its
finding that the two patents were unenforceable for inequitable conduct. On August&nbsp;24, 2009, we
asked the District Court to reconsider.

$200&nbsp;million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and will satisfy the remaining

Court for the District of Delaware seeking monetary and injunctive relief. On November&nbsp;10, 2008,
Cordis filed a motion for summary judgment and on May&nbsp;1, 2009, we filed a motion to dismiss the

8,550 patient claims, including almost all of the claims that have been consolidated in the MDL as
well as other filed and unfiled claims throughout the United States. On June&nbsp;13, 2006, the

Incentive Plan (LTIP), increasing the number of shares of our common stock available for issuance
under
the plan by 70&nbsp;million shares. Together with our 2000 LTIP, the plans provide for the issuance of
up to 160&nbsp;million shares of common stock. Shares reserved for future equity awards under our stock
incentive plans totaled approximately 109 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. Together, the Plans cover
officers, directors, employees and consultants and provide for the grant of various incentives,
including qualified and nonqualified options, deferred stock units, stock grants, share
appreciation rights, performance-based awards and market-based awards. The Executive Compensation
and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting of independent, non-employee
directors, may authorize the issuance of common stock and authorize cash awards under the plans in
recognition of the achievement of long-term performance objectives established by the Committee.

market price of our stock on the grant date, vest over a four-year service period, and have a

ten percent of the voting power of all classes of stock, the option granted will be at an exercise
price of 110&nbsp;percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and will
expire over a period not to exceed five years. Non-vested stock awards (awards other than options)
issued to employees are generally granted with an exercise price of zero and typically vest in four
to five equal installments over a five-year service period. These awards represent our commitment
to issue shares to recipients after a vesting period. Upon each vesting date, such awards are no
longer subject to risk of forfeiture and we issue shares of our common stock to the recipient. We
generally issue shares for option exercises and non-vested stock from our treasury, if available.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We use our historical volatility and implied volatility as a basis to estimate expected volatility
in our valuation of stock options.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>Expected Term</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We estimate the expected term of our options using historical exercise and forfeiture data. We
believe that this historical data is the best estimate of the expected term of our new option
grants. Approximately 75&nbsp;percent of stock options granted in 2007 related to a single grant to one
member of our executive management team. We performed a specific analysis for this grant and
determined that the grant had an expected term of 6.7&nbsp;years. We determined that the other grants
during 2007 had an expected term of 5.0&nbsp;years based on historical data.
</DIV>

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We use yield rates on U.S. Treasury securities for a period approximating the expected term of the
award to estimate the risk-free interest rate in our grant-date fair value assessment.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have not historically paid dividends to our shareholders. We currently do not intend to pay
dividends, and intend to retain all of our earnings to repay indebtedness and invest in the
continued growth of our business. Therefore, we have assumed an expected dividend yield of zero in
our grant-date fair value assessment.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On May&nbsp;22, 2007, we extended an offer to our non-director and non-executive employees to exchange
certain outstanding stock options for deferred stock units (DSUs). Stock options previously granted
under our stock plans with an exercise price of $25 or more per share were exchangeable for a
smaller number of DSUs, based on exchange ratios derived from the exercise prices of the
surrendered options. On June&nbsp;20, 2007, following the expiration of the offer, our employees
exchanged approximately 6.6&nbsp;million options for approximately 1.1&nbsp;million DSUs, which were subject
to additional vesting restrictions. We did not record incremental stock compensation expense as a
result of these exchanges because the fair values of the options exchanged equaled the fair values
of the DSUs issued.

Most of our stock awards provide for immediate vesting upon retirement, death or disability of the

eligibility or immediately if the employee is retirement eligible at the date of grant.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We recognize stock-based compensation expense for the value of the portion of awards that are
ultimately expected to vest. Statement No.&nbsp;123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time
of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates. The term &#147;forfeitures&#148; is distinct from &#147;cancellations&#148; or &#147;expirations&#148; and represents
only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. We have applied, based on an analysis of our
historical forfeitures, a weighted-average annual forfeiture rate of eight percent to all unvested
stock awards as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, which represents the portion that we expect will be forfeited
each year over the vesting period. We will re-evaluate this analysis periodically and adjust the
forfeiture rate as necessary. Ultimately, we will only recognize expense for those shares that
vest.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2006, our stockholders approved and adopted a new global employee stock purchase plan, which
provides for the granting of options to purchase up to 20&nbsp;million shares of our common stock to all
eligible employees. Under the employee stock purchase plan, we grant each eligible employee, at the
beginning of each six-month offering period, an option to purchase shares of our common stock equal
to not more than ten percent of the employee&#146;s eligible compensation or the statutory limit under
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Such options may be exercised generally only to the extent of
accumulated payroll deductions at the end of the offering period, at a purchase price equal to
90&nbsp;percent of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning or end of each offering
period, whichever is less. This discount was reduced from 15&nbsp;percent to ten percent effective for
the offering period beginning July&nbsp;1, 2007. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, there were approximately nine
million shares available for future issuance under the employee stock purchase plan.

plan based on employee contributions and the range of purchase prices is as follows:

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with our acquisition of Guidant, we assumed Guidant&#146;s employee stock ownership plan
(ESOP), which matched employee 401(k) contributions in the form of stock. As part of the Guidant
purchase accounting, we recognized deferred costs of $86&nbsp;million for the fair value of the shares
that were unallocated on the date of acquisition. Common stock held by the ESOP was allocated among
participants&#146; accounts on a periodic basis until these shares were exhausted and were treated as
outstanding in the computation of earnings per share. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, all of the
common stock held by the ESOP had been allocated to employee accounts. Allocated shares of the ESOP
were charged to expense based on the fair value of the common stock on the date of transfer. We
recognized compensation expense of $12&nbsp;million in 2008 and $23&nbsp;million in 2007 related to the plan.
Effective June&nbsp;1, 2008, this plan was merged into our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2009, we reorganized our international structure to provide more direct sales focus in the
marketplace. Accordingly, we have revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently
manage and view our business and have reclassified below previously reported segment results to be
consistent with the 2009 presentation. Each of our reportable segments generates revenues from the
sale of medical devices. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had four reportable segments based on
geographic regions: the United States; EMEA, consisting of Europe, the Middle East and Africa;
Japan; and Inter-Continental, consisting of Asia Pacific and the Americas. The reportable segments
represent an aggregate of all operating divisions within each segment. We measure and evaluate our
reportable segments based on segment net sales and operating income. We exclude from segment
operating income certain corporate and manufacturing-related expenses, as our corporate and
manufacturing functions do not meet the definition of a segment, as defined by ASC Topic 280,
<I>Segment Reporting </I>(formerly FASB Statement No.&nbsp;131, <I>Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information). </I>In addition, certain transactions or adjustments that our Chief Operating
Decision Maker considers to be non-recurring and/or non-operational, such as amounts related to
goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, litigation- and
restructuring-related activities; as well as amortization expense, are excluded from segment
operating income. Although we exclude these amounts from segment operating income, they are
included in reported consolidated operating income and are included in the reconciliation below.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We manage our international operating segments on a constant currency basis. Sales generated from
reportable segments and divested businesses, as well as operating results of reportable segments

exchange rates, which may differ from year to year, and do not include intersegment profits.

retains the fundamental requirements of Statement No.&nbsp;141, but requires the recognition of all
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at their fair values as of the
acquisition date. It also requires, for acquisitions involving contingent consideration, the
recognition of a liability equal to the expected fair value of future contingent payments at the
acquisition date. Additionally, Statement No.&nbsp;141(R) supersedes FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;4,
<I>Applicability of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase
Method</I>, which required research and development assets acquired in a business combination that had
no alternative future use to be measured at their fair values and expensed at the acquisition date.
Statement No.&nbsp;141(R) now requires that purchased research and development acquired in a business
combination be recognized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the completion or
abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Further, Statement No.
141(R) requires that we recognize changes in acquired income tax uncertainties (applied to
acquisitions before and after the adoption date) as income tax expense or benefit. We were required
all other provisions of Statement No.&nbsp;141(R) prospectively for any acquisitions on or after
January&nbsp;1, 2009. We did not consummate any material business combinations during 2009.

guidance in Topic 605 (formerly EITF Issue No.&nbsp;00-21, <I>Multiple-Element Arrangements</I>). Update No.
2009-13 provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables
exist, how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the
arrangement among those separate deliverables. Update No.&nbsp;2009-13 also expands the disclosure

to require that an enterprise perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise&#146;s variable
interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE). The
analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both 1) the power
to direct activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity&#146;s economic performance and
2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity.
Update No.&nbsp;2009-17 eliminated the quantitative approach previously required for determining the
primary beneficiary of a VIE and requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the
primary beneficiary. We are required to adopt Update No.&nbsp;2009-17 for our first quarter ending
March&nbsp;31, 2010. We do not believe the adoption of Update No.&nbsp;2009-17 will have a significant impact
on our future results of operations or financial position.
