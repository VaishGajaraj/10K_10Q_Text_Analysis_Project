</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Boston Scientific Corporation is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical
devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. Our mission is to
improve the quality of patient care and the productivity of healthcare delivery through the
development and advocacy of less-invasive medical devices and procedures. This is accomplished
through the continuing refinement of existing products and procedures and the investigation and
development of new technologies that are least- or less-invasive, reducing risk, trauma, procedure
time and the need for aftercare; cost- and comparatively-effective and, where possible, reduce or
eliminate refractory drug use. When used in this report, the terms &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;our&#148; and &#147;the
Company&#148; mean Boston Scientific Corporation and its divisions and subsidiaries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our history began in the late 1960s when our co-founder, John Abele, acquired an equity interest in
Medi-tech, Inc., a research and development company focused on developing alternatives to surgery.
In 1969, Medi-tech introduced a family of steerable catheters used in some of the first
less-invasive procedures performed. In 1979, John Abele joined with Pete Nicholas to form Boston
Scientific Corporation, which indirectly acquired Medi-tech. This acquisition began a period of
active and focused marketing, new product development and organizational growth. Since then, we
have advanced the practice of less-invasive medicine by helping physicians and other medical
professionals treat a variety of diseases and conditions and improve patients&#146; quality of life by
providing alternatives to surgery and other medical procedures that are typically traumatic to the
body.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our net sales have increased substantially since our formation over thirty years ago. Our growth
has been fueled in part by strategic acquisitions and alliances designed to improve our ability to
take advantage of growth opportunities in the medical device industry. On April&nbsp;21, 2006, we
consummated our acquisition of Guidant Corporation. With this acquisition, we became a major
provider in the worldwide cardiac rhythm management (CRM)&nbsp;market, enhancing our overall competitive
position and long-term growth potential and further diversifying our product portfolio. This
acquisition has established us as one of the world&#146;s largest cardiovascular device companies and a
global leader in microelectronic therapies. This and other strategic acquisitions have helped us to
add promising new technologies to our pipeline and to offer one of the broadest product portfolios
in the world for use in less-invasive procedures. We believe that the depth and breadth of our
product portfolio has also enabled us to compete more effectively in, and better absorb the
pressures of, the current healthcare environment of cost containment, managed care, large buying
groups, government contracting and hospital consolidation and will generally assist us in
navigating through the complexities of the global healthcare market, including healthcare
reform.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our strategy is to lead global markets for less-invasive medical devices by developing and
marketing innovative products, services and therapies that address unmet patient needs, provide
superior clinical outcomes and demonstrate proven economic value. We intend to do so by building
and buying products we understand, through sales forces we already have. The following are the five
elements of our strategic plan:

competitive organization that we believe will improve our ability to deliver innovative
products and technologies, leading clinical science and exceptional service; as well as the
restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions. We are centralizing

organizing our clinical organization to take full advantage of the global resources available
to conduct more cost-effective clinical studies, accelerate the time to bring new products to

electrical signal to mask pain signals traveling from the spinal cord to the brain. The Precision
System utilizes a rechargeable battery and features a programming system. In 2010, we received FDA
approval and launched two lead splitters, as well as the Linear&#153; 3-4 and Linear 3-6 Percutaneous
Leads for use with our SCS systems, offering a broader range of lead configurations and designed to
provide physicians more treatment options for their chronic pain patients. These leads provide the
broadest range of percutaneous lead configurations in the industry. We believe that we continue to
have a technology advantage over our competitors with proprietary features such as Multiple
Independent Current Control, which is intended to allow the physician to target specific areas of
pain more precisely, and are involved in various studies designed to evaluate the use of spinal
cord stimulation in the treatment of additional sources of pain. As a demonstration of our
commitment to strengthening clinical evidence with spinal cord stimulation, we have initiated a
trial to assess the therapeutic effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation
compared to reoperation in patients with failed back surgery syndrome. We believe that this trial
could result in consideration of spinal cord stimulation much earlier in the continuum of care. In
addition, in late 2010 we initiated a European clinical trial for the treatment of Parkinson&#146;s

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our
products are designed and manufactured  in technology centers around the world,
either by us or third parties. In
most cases, the manufacturing of our products is concentrated
in one or a few locations.
We consistently monitor our inventory levels, manufacturing and
distribution capabilities, and maintain recovery plans to address
potential disruptions that we may encounter; however,  any significant interruption in our ability to manufacture these products over an extended duration may result in delays in our ability
to resume production of affected products, due to needs for regulatory approvals. As a result, we
may suffer loss of market share, which we may be unable to recapture, and harm to our reputation,
which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
</DIV>
<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">
Many components
used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw
materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources. Certain items are custom
made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity exists at our
suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a
reasonable period of time. We also have an on-going program to identify single-source components
and to develop alternative back-up supplies and we regularly re-address the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs. However, in certain cases, we may not be able to
quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for specific materials, components or
products, largely due to the regulatory approval system and the complex nature of our manufacturing
processes and those of our suppliers. A reduction or interruption in supply, an inability to
develop and validate alternative sources if required, or a significant increase in the price of raw
materials, components or products could adversely affect our operations and financial condition,
particularly materials or components related to our CRM products and drug-eluting stent systems. In
addition, our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal
resources and third-party vendors to perform this service. We believe
we have redundant capabilities that are sufficient to sterilize our products; however, to the extent we or our third-party sterilizers are unable
to sterilize our products, whether due to capacity, regulatory or other constraints, we may be unable
to transition to other providers in a timely manner, which could have an adverse impact on our
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Certain products are manufactured for us by third parties. We are currently reliant on Abbott
Laboratories for our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems in the U.S. and Japan. Our supply
agreement with Abbott for everolimus-eluting stent systems in these regions extends through the end
of the second quarter of 2012. At present, we believe that our supply of everolimus-eluting stent
systems from Abbott, coupled with our current launch plans for our next-generation
internally-developed and manufactured everolimus-eluting stent system in these regions, is
sufficient to meet customer demand. However, any production or capacity issues that affect Abbott&#146;s
manufacturing capabilities or our process for forecasting, ordering and receiving shipments may
impact the ability to increase or decrease our level of supply in a timely manner; therefore, our
supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott may not align with customer
demand, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Further, a delay in the launch
of our internally-developed and manufactured next-generation PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; everolimus-eluting
stent system in the U.S. and Japan, currently expected in mid-2012, could result in an inability to
meet customer demand for everolimus-eluting stent systems. We launched our PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; stent
system in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries in the fourth quarter of 2009,
quickly gaining market share, exiting 2010 with approximately one
quarter share of the drug-eluting stent market

regulatory problems at three of our facilities and advising us that our corporate-wide corrective
action plan relating to three site-specific warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. We
identified solutions to the quality system issues cited by the FDA and implemented those solutions
throughout our organization. During 2008, the FDA reinspected a number of our facilities and, in
October&nbsp;2008, informed us that our quality system was in substantial compliance with its Quality
System Regulations. In November&nbsp;2009 and January&nbsp;2010, the FDA reinspected two of our sites to
follow up on observations from the 2008 FDA inspections. Both of these FDA inspections confirmed
that all issues at the sites have been resolved and all restrictions related to the corporate

and European distribution centers, are certified under the ISO13485:2003 quality system standard,
established by the International Standards Organization, for medical devices, which requires, among
other items, an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control,
product design and manufacturing operations. This certification can be obtained only after a
complete audit of a company&#146;s quality system by an independent outside auditor. Maintenance of the

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell
our products from various companies, some of which may have greater financial and marketing
resources than we do. Our primary competitors include Johnson &#038; Johnson (including its subsidiary,
Cordis Corporation); Medtronic, Inc.; Abbott Laboratories; and St. Jude Medical, Inc.; as well as a
wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products
or participate in only a specific market segment. We also face competition from non-medical device
companies, such as pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease
states intended to be treated using our products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We believe that our products compete primarily on their ability to safely and effectively perform
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in a less-invasive manner, including clinical outcomes, ease
of use, comparative effectiveness, reliability and physician familiarity. In the current
environment of managed care, economically-motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare
providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly
required to compete on the basis of price, value, reliability and efficiency. We believe the
current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could put additional competitive
pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and market sizes.
We recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to offer products
with differentiated clinical outcomes; create or acquire innovative, scientifically advanced
technology; apply our technology cost-effectively and with superior quality across product lines
and markets; develop or acquire proprietary products; attract and retain skilled personnel; obtain
patent or other protection for our products; obtain required regulatory and reimbursement
approvals; continually enhance our quality systems; manufacture and successfully market our
products either directly or through outside parties; and supply sufficient inventory to meet
customer demand.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Regulatory Environment</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory
bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require
manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the
development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices.
Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of
which requires that a clinical evaluation be conducted before a device receives approval for
commercial distribution.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In the U.S., approval to distribute a new device generally can be met in one of three ways. The
first process requires that a pre-market notification (510(k) Submission) be made to the FDA to
demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally
marketed device that is not subject to pre-market approval (PMA), i.e., the &#147;predicate&#148; device. An
appropriate predicate device for a pre-market notification is one that (i)&nbsp;was legally marketed
prior to May&nbsp;28, 1976, (ii)&nbsp;was approved under a PMA but then subsequently reclassified from Class
III to Class&nbsp;II or I, or (iii)&nbsp;has been found to be substantially equivalent and cleared for

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">commercial distribution under a 510(k) Submission. Applicants must submit descriptive data and,
when necessary, performance data to establish that the device is substantially equivalent to a
predicate device. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in
support of a 510(k) Submission. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to
the applicable Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)&nbsp;regulations. The FDA must issue an order
finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to existing
devices covered by a 510(k) Submission that are not significant can generally be made without
additional 510(k) Submissions. Changes that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness
of the device, such as significant changes in designs or materials, may require a new 510(k) with
data to support that the modified device remains substantially equivalent. In August&nbsp;2010, the FDA
released numerous draft proposals on the 510(k) process aimed at increasing transparency and
streamlining the process, while adding more scientific rigor to the review process. In January
2011, the FDA released the implementation plan for changes to the 510(k) Submission program, which
includes additional training of FDA staff, the creation of various guidance documents intended to
provide greater clarity to certain processes, as well as various internal changes to the FDA&#146;s
procedures. We have a portfolio of products that includes numerous Class&nbsp;II medical devices.
Several of the FDA&#146;s proposals could increase the regulatory burden on our industry, including
those that could increase the cost, complexity and time to market for certain high-risk Class&nbsp;II
medical devices.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The second process requires the submission of an application for PMA to the FDA to demonstrate that
the device is safe and effective for its intended use as manufactured. This approval process
applies to certain Class&nbsp;III devices. In this case, two steps of FDA approval are generally
required before marketing in the U.S. can begin. First, we must comply with the applicable IDE
regulations in connection with any human clinical investigation of the device in the U.S. Second,
the FDA must review our PMA application, which contains, among other things, clinical information
acquired under the IDE. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a
reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The third process requires that an application for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE)&nbsp;be made to
the FDA for the use of a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD). A HUD is intended to benefit patients by
treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects, or is manifested in, fewer than 4,000
individuals in the U.S. per year. The application submitted to the FDA for an HDE is similar in
both form and content to a PMA application, but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a
PMA. This approval process demonstrates that there is no comparable device available to treat or
diagnose the condition, the device will not expose patients to unreasonable or significant risk,
and the benefits to health from use outweigh the risks. The HUD provision of the regulation
provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of
diseases affecting smaller patient populations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The FDA can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices;
order repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of health
professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of
substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain certain violations of
the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical devices, or
initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. International sales of medical devices
manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned
or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported
devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported.
Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical
devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country
prior to application in the U.S. to take advantage of differing regulatory requirements. Most
countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis,
generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device
changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing
to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be
approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In the European Union, we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives
(including the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive) and
obtain CE Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE Mark certification, granted
following approval from an independent notified body, is an international symbol of adherence to
quality assurance standards and

other foreign regulations such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the Japanese
Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW)&nbsp;before we can launch new products in Japan. The time
required to obtain these foreign approvals to market our products may vary from U.S. approvals, and
requirements for these approvals may differ from those required by the FDA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are also subject to various environmental laws, directives and regulations both in the U.S. and
abroad. Our operations, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances
regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We do
not believe that compliance with environmental laws will have a material impact on our capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, given the scope and nature of these laws,
there can be no assurance that environmental laws will not have a material impact on our results of
operations. We assess potential environmental contingent liabilities on a regular basis. At
present, we are not aware of any such liabilities that would have a material impact on our
business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We believe that sound environmental, health and safety performance contributes to our competitive
strength while benefiting our customers, shareholders and employees. We are committed to continuous
improvement in these areas by reducing pollution, the depletion of natural resources, and our
overall environmental footprint. Specifically, we are working to optimize energy and resource
usage, ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste. We are certified to the FTSE4Good
Corporate Social Responsibility Index, managed by The Financial Times and the London Stock
Exchange, which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of
corporate responsibility. This certification recognizes our dedication to those standards, and it

monitor and influence a myriad of legislative and administrative policies impacting us, both on a
domestic and an international front. The Government Affairs office works closely with members of
Congress, key Congressional committee staff and White House and Administration staff, which
facilitates our active engagement on issues affecting our business. Our proactive approach and
depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal, state
and global decision-makers, while also advancing our business objectives by educating policymakers
on our positions, key priorities and the value of our technologies. The Government Affairs office
also manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting
our industry and healthcare in general.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential
fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and
private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation,
competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies,
technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do
business, including the U.S. These changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on
the delivery of more cost-effective treatments. Although we believe our less-invasive products and
technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources
necessary to demonstrate comparative effectiveness may be significant. In addition, uncertainty
remains regarding proposed significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Further, certain state governments have recently enacted, and the federal government has proposed,
legislation aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between industry and healthcare
professionals (HCPs). As a result, we are required by law to report many types of direct and
indirect payments and other transfers of value to HCPs licensed by certain states and expect that
we will have to make similar reports at the federal level in the near future. We have devoted
substantial time and financial resources in order to develop and implement enhanced structure,
policies, systems and processes in order to comply with these legal and regulatory

policies, systems and processes, or failure to comply with these policies could have a negative
impact on our results of operations.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Additionally, our results of operations could be substantially affected by global economic factors
and local operating and economic conditions. Our customers may experience financial difficulties or
be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or
decision to purchase our products, particularly capital equipment, or to pay for our products they
do purchase on a timely basis, if at all. We cannot predict to what extent global economic
conditions and the increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the U.S. and abroad may
negatively impact our average selling prices, our net sales and profit margins, procedural volumes
and reimbursement rates from third-party payors.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers
around the world that typically bill various third-party payors, including governmental programs
(e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care programs, for the
healthcare services provided to their patients. Third-party payors may provide or deny coverage for
certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment
criteria. Reimbursement by third-party payors for these services is based on a wide range of
methodologies that may reflect the services&#146; assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and
economic value. These reimbursement methodologies confer different, and sometimes conflicting,
levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients, and these
methodologies are subject to frequent refinements. Third-party payors are also increasingly
adjusting reimbursement rates, often downwards, and challenging the prices charged for medical
products and services. There can be no assurance that our products will be covered automatically by
third-party payors, that reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the third-party
payors&#146; coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, are also underway
in many countries in which we do business. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and
healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., Japan, Europe and other international
markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products
and may influence a physician&#146;s selection of products used to treat patients.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Proprietary Rights and Patent Litigation</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements to
protect our intellectual property. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and foreign
countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of December
31, 2010, we held more than 15,000 patents, and had approximately 9,000 patent applications pending
worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology. In addition, we hold exclusive and
non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent
applications. There can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in the
issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or
circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad
to protect our technology or to provide us with a competitive advantage. In the aggregate, these
intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we
believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license,
except for those relating to our drug-eluting coronary stent systems, is material in relation to
our business as a whole.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other
parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There can be no
assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any
breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third
parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge.

the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which we compete. We continue to defend
ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others.
Adverse determinations in any patent litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to
third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties, and, if licenses are not available,
prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using certain of our products, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate
litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and to determine
the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Patent litigation can be costly and
time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be significant
in the future or that the outcome of litigation will be favorable to us. Accordingly, we may seek
to settle some or all of our pending litigation, particularly to manage risk over time. Settlement
may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our
other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties.

asserted against us. Product liability and securities claims may be asserted against us in the
future related to events unknown at the present time. We are substantially self-insured with
respect to product liability and intellectual property infringement claims. We maintain insurance
policies providing limited coverage against securities claims. The absence of significant
third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse
decisions. Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation and other litigation in
the future, regardless of outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe
that our risk management practices, including limited insurance coverage, are reasonably adequate
to protect against anticipated product liability and securities litigation losses. However,
unanticipated catastrophic losses could have a material adverse impact on our financial position,
results of operations and liquidity.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On March&nbsp;15, 2010, we announced the ship hold and removal of field inventory of all ICD systems and
CRT-D systems offered by our CRM division in the U.S., after determining that certain instances of
changes in the manufacturing process related to these products were not submitted for approval to
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We have since submitted the required documentation
and, on April&nbsp;15, 2010, we resumed U.S. distribution of our COGNIS&#174; CRT-D systems and TELIGEN&#174; ICD
systems, and, on May&nbsp;21, 2010, we resumed U.S. distribution of all of our remaining CRT-D and ICD
devices, in each case following required FDA clearance. As a result of these actions, we have
suffered and may continue to suffer loss of market share for these products in the U.S. While we
continue to work on recapturing lost market share, our on-going net sales and results of operations
will likely continue to be negatively impacted. We may be unable to minimize this impact, or to
offset with the release of future products, and we may suffer on-going harm to our reputation,
among other risks and uncertainties, each of which may have an adverse impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

systems, may materially adversely affect our results of operations.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have experienced pricing pressures across many of our businesses due to competitive activity,
increased market power of our customers as the healthcare industry consolidates, economic pressures
experienced by our customers, and the impact of managed care organizations and other third-party
payors. Competitive pricing pressures, including aggressive pricing offered by market entrants,
have particularly affected our drug-eluting coronary stent system offerings. We estimate that the
average selling price of our drug-eluting stent systems in the U.S. decreased nine percent in 2010
as compared to the prior year. Continued declines in average selling prices of our products due to
pricing pressures may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>We derive a significant portion of our net sales from the sale of drug-eluting coronary stent
systems and CRM products. Declines in market size, average selling prices, procedural volumes, and
our share of the markets in which we compete; increased competition; market perceptions of studies
published by third parties; interruption in supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems in the U.S.
and Japan; changes in our sales personnel; or product launch delays may materially adversely affect
our results of operations and financial condition, including potential future write-offs of our
goodwill and other intangible assets balances.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Net sales from drug-eluting coronary stent systems represented approximately 20&nbsp;percent of our
consolidated net sales during 2010. In 2010, lower average selling prices driven by competitive
and other pricing pressures resulted in a decline in our share of the U.S. drug-eluting stent
market, as well as an overall decrease in the size of the market. Recent competitive launches and
clinical trial enrollment limiting our access to certain drug-eluting stent system customers
negatively impacted our share of the worldwide drug-eluting stent market. There can be no
assurance that these and other factors will not further impact our share of the U.S. or worldwide
drug-eluting stent markets, that we will regain share of the U.S. or worldwide drug-eluting stent
markets, or that the size of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market will reach previous levels or will
not decline further, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or
financial condition. In addition, we expect to launch our internally-developed and manufactured
next-generation everolimus-eluting stent system, the PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; platinum chromium coronary
stent system, in the U.S. and Japan in mid-2012, and we expect to launch our next-generation TAXUS&#174;
Element&#153; stent system in the U.S. in mid-2011 and Japan in late 2011 or early 2012. A delay in the
timing of the launch of next-generation products may result in a further decline in our market
share and have an adverse impact on our results of operations.

production or capacity issues that affect Abbott&#146;s manufacturing capabilities or our process for
forecasting, ordering and receiving shipments may impact our ability to increase or decrease the
level of supply to us in a timely manner; therefore, our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems
supplied to us by Abbott may not align with customer demand. Our supply agreement for the PROMUS&#174;
stent system from Abbott extends through the end of the second quarter of 2012 in the U.S. and
Japan. Our inability to obtain regulatory approval and timely launch our PROMUS&#174; Element stent
system in these regions could result in an inability to meet customer demand for everolimus-eluting
stent systems and may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Net sales from our CRM group represented approximately 28&nbsp;percent of our consolidated net sales in
2010. Worldwide CRM market growth rates, including the U.S. ICD market, remain low. Further,
physician reaction to study results published by the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I>
regarding evidence-based guidelines for ICD implants and the U.S. Department of Justice
investigation into ICD implants may have a negative impact on the size of the CRM market. Our U.S.
ICD sales represented approximately 48&nbsp;percent of our worldwide CRM net sales in 2010, and any
changes in this market could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results
of operations. We have suffered, and may continue to suffer, loss of net sales and market share in
the U.S. due to the ship hold and removal of field inventory of all of our ICDs and CRT-Ds offered
in the U.S., which we announced on March&nbsp;15, 2010. There can be no assurance that the size of the
CRM market will increase above existing levels or that we will be able to increase CRM market share
or increase net sales in a timely manner, if at all. Decreases in market size or our share of the
CRM market and decreases in net sales from our CRM products could have a significant impact on our
financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our inability to increase our worldwide
CRM net sales could result in future goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges. We
expect to launch our next-generation wireless pacemaker in our Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA)
region and certain Inter-Continental countries during the second half of 2011, and in the U.S. in
late 2011 or early 2012. Variability in the timing of the launch of next-generation products may
result in excess or expired inventory positions and future inventory charges, which may result in a
loss of market share and adversely impact our results of operations.

PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; stent system net sales may continue to adversely impact our gross profit and

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As a result of the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the gross profit and operating
profit margin of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott, including any

significantly lower than that of our TAXUS&#174; stent system, TAXUS&#174; Element&#153; stent system and PROMUS&#174;

Abbott continue to increase in relation to our total drug-eluting stent system sales, our profit
margins will continue to decrease. Further, the price we pay for our supply of everolimus-eluting
stent systems supplied to us by Abbott is determined by our contracts with Abbott. Our cost is
based, in part, on previously fixed estimates of Abbott&#146;s manufacturing costs for

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and
reforms by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a
consolidation trend in the healthcare industry, including hospitals. This consolidation has
resulted in greater pricing pressures, decreased average selling prices, and the exclusion of
certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent
delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some
of our hospital customers. While our strategic initiatives include measures to address these
trends, there can be no assurance that these measures will succeed. We expect that market demand,
government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and
societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further
business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors, which may reduce
competition and continue to exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and
adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>We face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes
in the medical devices industry, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The medical device markets in which we primarily participate are highly competitive. We encounter
significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold
from various medical device companies, some of which may have greater financial and marketing
resources than we do. Our primary competitors include Johnson &#038; Johnson (including its subsidiary,
Cordis Corporation); Medtronic, Inc.; Abbott Laboratories; and St. Jude Medical, Inc.; as well as a
wide range of companies that sell a single or a limited number of competitive products or which
participate in only a specific market segment. We also face competition from non-medical device
companies, including pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease
states intended to be treated using our products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Additionally, the medical device market is characterized by extensive research and development, and
rapid technological change. Developments by other companies of new or improved products, processes
or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may
negatively impact our net sales. We are required to devote continued efforts and financial
resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products, apply our
technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, attract and retain skilled
development personnel, obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products, obtain
required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our
products consistent with our quality standards. If we fail to develop new products or enhance
existing products, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
results of operations.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 44&nbsp;percent of our net sales in 2010.
Additionally, a significant percentage of our future growth is expected to come from international

result, our sales growth and operating profits from our international operations may be limited by
risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions, foreign currency
fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, competitive
offerings, infrastructure development, rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement
our overall business strategy. Further, international markets are also being affected by economic

foreign government efforts to understand healthcare practices and pricing in other countries, which
could result in increased pricing transparency across geographies and pressure to harmonize
reimbursement and ultimately reduce the selling prices of our products. Certain foreign governments
may allow favorable reimbursements for locally-manufactured products, which may put us at a
competitive disadvantage and negatively affect our market share. The trend in countries around the
world, including Japan, toward more stringent regulatory requirements for product clearance,
changing reimbursement models and more rigorous inspection and enforcement activities has generally
caused or may cause medical device manufacturers to experience more uncertainty, delay, risk and
expense. In addition, most international jurisdictions have adopted regulatory approval and
periodic renewal requirements for medical devices, and we must comply with these requirements in
order to market our products in these jurisdictions. Any significant changes in the competitive,
political, legal, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international
operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of
operations. We have recently realigned our international structure and are devoting resources to
focus on increasing net sales in emerging markets. Sales practices in certain international

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We had total debt of $5.438&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, attributable in large part to our 2006

our 2011 debt maturities, establishing a $1.0&nbsp;billion term loan and syndicating a new $2.0&nbsp;billion
revolving credit facility, and prepaid in full our $900&nbsp;million loan from Abbott Laboratories and

$250&nbsp;million of our senior notes due in January&nbsp;2011 and borrowed $250&nbsp;million under our credit and
security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables, using the proceeds to pre-pay all $100
million of our 2011 term loan maturities and $150&nbsp;million of our 2012 term loan maturities. As
part of our strategy to increase operational leverage and continue to strengthen our financial
flexibility, we are continuing to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and
efficiency, closed the sale of our Neurovascular business and implemented other strategic
initiatives to generate proceeds that would be available for debt repayment. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to repay our indebtedness. Further, certain of our current credit
ratings are below investment grade and our inability to regain investment grade credit ratings
could increase our cost of borrowing funds in the future. Any disruption in our cash flow or our
ability to effectively manage our debt levels could have an adverse effect on our financial
condition or results of operations. In addition, our term loan and revolving credit facility
agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios. If
we are unable to satisfy these covenants, we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders and

a definitive agreement to sell our Neurovascular business, we performed an interim impairment test
on our international reporting units, excluding the assets of that business, and determined that
the remaining goodwill balances were not impaired. However, we have identified four reporting units
with a material amount of goodwill that are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step
of the impairment test in future reporting periods. These reporting units include our U.S. CRM

adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects and retain key employees, and
our ability to achieve synergies with our acquired companies, such as increasing sales of our
products, achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products.
Our failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined acquired companies

Reconciliation Act of 2010 were enacted into law in the U.S. in March&nbsp;2010. As a U.S.

materially impact us. Certain provisions of the legislation will not be effective for a number of
years, there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully
established or consequences not fully understood, and it is unclear what the full impact of the
legislation will be. The legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a 2.3&nbsp;percent excise
tax on U.S. sales of Class&nbsp;I, II and III medical devices beginning in 2013. U.S. net sales
represented 56&nbsp;percent of our worldwide net sales in 2010 and, therefore, this tax burden may have
a material, negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows. Other provisions of
this legislation, including Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs,
comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to
evaluate alternative payment methodologies, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is
developed and delivered, and may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further,
we cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the
federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. or

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers
around the world that typically bill various third-party payors, including governmental programs
(e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care programs, for the
healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate
reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental third-party payors is
critical to the success of medical technology companies. The availability of reimbursement affects
which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies from
country to country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and services. After
we develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement
approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors. Further legislative or
administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the U.S., Japan, or other international
countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical
devices or denies coverage for those procedures, including price regulation, competitive pricing,
coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and
managed-care arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Major third-party payors for hospital services in the U.S. and abroad continue to work to contain
healthcare costs. The introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of
healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased
discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed, has lead to
increased physician employment by hospitals in the U.S., and has shifted services between inpatient
and outpatient settings. Initiatives to limit the increase of healthcare costs, including price
regulation, are also underway in several countries in which we do business. Hospitals or physicians
may respond to these cost-containment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other
therapies for our products. In connection with Guidant&#146;s product recalls, certain third-party
payors have sought, and others may seek, recourse against us for amounts previously reimbursed.

that have added or are expected to add to the delays and uncertainties associated with new product
releases, as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those releases. Even after
products have received marketing approval or clearance, product approvals and clearances by the FDA
can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen
problems following initial approval. There can be no assurance that we will receive the required
clearances for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any

subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, those changes might have on our
business. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations. Later discovery of previously unknown
problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory
clearances, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, operating
restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. We may also initiate field actions as a result of a
failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies. The failure to receive product
approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In order to develop new products and improve current product offerings, we focus our research and
development programs largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings
across multiple programs and businesses. We expect to launch our internally-manufactured
next-generation everolimus-eluting stent system, the PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; platinum chromium coronary
stent, in the U.S. and Japan in mid-2012, subject to regulatory approval. In addition, we expect to
continue to invest in our CRM technologies, including our LATITUDE&#174; Patient Management System and
our next-generation products and technologies. If we are unable to develop and launch these and
other products as anticipated, our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the
drug-eluting stent and CRM markets may be materially adversely impacted. Further, we are continuing
to investigate, and have completed several acquisitions involving, opportunities to further expand
our presence in, and diversify into, areas including, but not limited to, atrial fibrillation,
underserved defibrillator populations, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease,
structural heart disease, hypertension, women&#146;s health, endoluminal surgery, diabetes/obesity,
endoscopic pulmonary intervention and deep-brain stimulation. Expanding our focus beyond our
current businesses is expensive and time-consuming. Further, there can be no assurance that we will
be able to access these technologies on terms favorable to us, or that these technologies will
achieve commercial feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. A delay in
the development or approval of these technologies or our decision to reduce our investments may
adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growth.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>The medical device industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental
authorities and is the subject of numerous investigations, often involving marketing and other
business practices. These investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation
by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. These
authorities have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry. We have received subpoenas and
other requests for information from Congress and other state and federal governmental agencies,
including, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Office of Inspector General of
the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Defense. These
investigations relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers, regulatory
compliance and product promotional practices. We are cooperating with these investigations and are
responding to these requests. We cannot predict when the investigations will be resolved, the
outcome of these investigations or their impact on us. An adverse outcome in one or more of these
investigations could include the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings; substantial fines,
penalties and administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs,
entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs) with governmental agencies and amendments to
existing CIAs. In addition, resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of
additional and costly compliance obligations. For example, in 2009, we entered into a civil
settlement with the DOJ regarding the DOJ&#146;s investigation relating to certain post-market surveys
conducted by Guidant Corporation before we acquired Guidant in 2006. As part of the settlement, we
entered into a CIA with the Office of Inspector General for HHS. The CIA requires enhancements to
certain compliance procedures related to financial arrangements with healthcare providers. The
obligations imposed upon us by the CIA and cooperation with ongoing investigations will involve
employee resources costs and diversion of employee focus. Cooperation typically also involves
document production costs. We may incur greater future costs to fulfill the obligations imposed
upon us by the CIA. Further, the CIA, and if any of the ongoing investigations continue over a long
period of time, could further divert the attention of management from the day-to-day operations of
our business and impose significant additional administrative burdens on us. These potential
consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from these investigations, could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, certain state governments (including that of Massachusetts, where we are
headquartered) have enacted, and the federal government has proposed, legislation aimed at
increasing transparency of our interactions with healthcare professionals (HCPs). As a result, we
are required by law to disclose payments and other transfers for value to HCPs licensed by certain
states and expect similar requirements at the federal level in the future. Any failure to comply
with the enhanced legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business. In addition, we
devoted substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement
enhanced structure, policies, systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory
requirements, which may also impact our business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Further, recent Supreme Court case law has clarified that the FDA&#146;s authority over medical devices
preempts state tort laws, but legislation has been introduced at the Federal level to allow state
intervention, which could lead to increased and inconsistent regulation at the state level. We
anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that we will be
subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the future.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various
foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax
authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We
regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of
our tax provision and have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures,
including potential tax audit adjustments related to transfer pricing in connection with the
technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant Corporation, in
relation to which we recently received Notices of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service for
the 2001-2003 tax years. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the
outcomes of these audits or issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost
that does not exceed our related reserves, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a
material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, changes in tax
laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for
fundamental U.S. corporate tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our
future results of operations. In addition, the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 impose on
medical device manufacturers a 2.3&nbsp;percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class&nbsp;I, II and III medical
devices beginning in 2013. U.S. net sales represented 56&nbsp;percent of our worldwide net sales in 2010
and, therefore, this tax burden may have a material, negative impact on our results of operations
and our cash flows.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>We may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property rights, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. Physician
customers, particularly in interventional cardiology, have historically moved quickly to new
products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and
trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. However,
intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. Furthermore, appellate
courts can overturn lower court patent decisions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across
product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties.
In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related
proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently
drive settlement not only of individual cases, but also of a series of pending and potentially
related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically
sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial
court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are
difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in
other geographies.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Patents and other proprietary rights are and will continue to be essential to our business, and our
ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature
of our technologies. We rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations,
strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive
position. We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the U.S. and abroad
for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and attempt to review third-party patents
and patent applications to the extent publicly available in order to develop an effective patent
strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor
the patent claims of others. We currently own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and have numerous
patent applications pending. We also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which
patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash, cross-licensing rights or
royalty payments. No assurance can be made that any pending or future patent applications will
result in the issuance of patents, that any current or future patents issued to, or licensed by, us
will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors, or that our patents will not be found
invalid. In addition, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents, trade
secrets or know-how or to assert them against claimed infringement by others. Any legal action of
that type could be costly and time consuming and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be
successful. We are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent
infringement and other intellectual property-related actions.

in more detail under Item&nbsp;3. Legal Proceedings and <I>Note L- Commitments and Contingencies </I>to our
2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report<I>. </I>Intellectual
property litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict.
Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our
ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial condition, results of
operation or liquidity. Pending or future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or
other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert
the attention of our technical and management personnel. In the event that our right to market any
of our products is successfully challenged, we may be required to obtain a license on terms which
may not be favorable to us, if at all. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to

cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant. Further, we are substantially
self-insured with respect to product liability and intellectual property infringement claims. We
maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims. The absence of
significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims

periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with its Quality System Regulation requirements,
which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing,
quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the Federal Medical Device Reporting
regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably
suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a
malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with
applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously
through periodic inspections by the FDA which may result in observations on Form&nbsp;483, and in some
cases warning letters, that require corrective action. In the European Community, we are required
to maintain certain International Standards Organization (ISO)&nbsp;certifications in order to sell our
products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these
certifications. If we, or our manufacturers, fail to adhere to quality system regulations or ISO
requirements, this could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties in

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In connection with our Plant Network Optimization program, described in Items 1 and 8 of this
Annual Report, we intend to close one of our manufacturing plants in the U.S. by the end of 2012,
representing a total of approximately 350,000 owned square feet. In addition, as part of the
January&nbsp;2011 sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation, we intend to
transfer portions of certain owned and leased facilities to Stryker. We regularly evaluate the
condition and capacity of our facilities to ensure they are suitable for the development,
manufacturing, and marketing of our products, and provide adequate capacity for current and
expected future needs.

</DIV>

statements and accompanying notes included in Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U>Financial Highlights and Trends</U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2010, we generated net sales of $7.806&nbsp;billion, as compared to $8.188&nbsp;billion in 2009, a
decrease of $382&nbsp;million, or five percent. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed $62&nbsp;million to
our net sales in 2010, as compared to 2009. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, our net sales
decreased $444&nbsp;million, or five percent, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was
attributable in part to the ship hold and removal of field inventory of all implantable
cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)&nbsp;systems and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator
(CRT-D) systems offered by our Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM)&nbsp;division in the U.S., which we
announced on March&nbsp;15, 2010, after determining that certain instances of changes in the
manufacturing process related to these products were not submitted for approval to the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA). We have since submitted the required documentation and, on April&nbsp;15,
2010, we received clearance from the FDA for certain of the manufacturing changes and immediately
resumed distribution of our COGNIS&#174; CRT-D systems and TELIGEN&#174; ICD systems, which represent
virtually all of our defibrillator implant volume in the U.S. We returned earlier generations of
these products to the U.S. market on May&nbsp;21, 2010, following required FDA clearance. We are working
with our physician and patient customers to recapture market share lost as a result of the ship
hold and have experienced better-than-expected recovery to date. However, our U.S. CRM net sales
decreased $237&nbsp;million in 2010, as compared to our market share
exiting 2009, and we estimate that our U.S. defibrillator
market share decreased approximately 300 basis points exiting 2010, as compared to the prior year,
due primarily to these product actions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, throughout 2010 we continued to experience competitive and other pricing pressures
across our businesses and, particularly, on our drug-eluting coronary stent system offerings. Net
sales of our drug-eluting coronary stent systems decreased $171&nbsp;million in 2010, as compared to
2009, and we estimate that the average selling price of our drug-eluting stent systems in the U.S.
decreased nine percent in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Further, our net sales have been
adversely impacted by reductions in procedural volumes, due to unemployment levels and other
economic factors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During 2010, net sales from our Endoscopy, Urology/Women&#146;s Health, and Neuromodulation businesses
increased $117&nbsp;million, or eight percent, as compared to 2009, on the strength of new product
introductions, increased sales investments and further expansion into international markets. Refer
to the <I>Business and Market Overview </I>and <I>Results of Operations </I>sections for more discussion of our
net sales by division and region.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our reported net loss in 2010 was $1.065&nbsp;billion, or $0.70 per share, and was driven primarily by a
goodwill impairment charge related to our U.S. CRM reporting unit following the ship hold and
product removal actions described above. Our reported results for 2010 included goodwill and
intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, litigation- and
restructuring-related net charges; discrete tax items and amortization expense (after-tax) of
$2.116&nbsp;billion, or $1.39 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2010 was $1.051&nbsp;billion,
or $0.69 per share. Our reported net loss in 2009 was $1.025&nbsp;billion, or $0.68 per share. Our
reported results for 2009 included intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-,
litigation- and restructuring-related net charges; discrete tax items and amortization expense of
$2.207&nbsp;billion (after-tax), or $1.46 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2009 was
$1.182&nbsp;billion, or $0.78 per share.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Net income and net income per share that exclude certain
items are not measures prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). See
<I>Additional Information </I>for an explanation of management&#146;s use of these non-GAAP measures. The
following is a reconciliation of our results of operations prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to
those adjusted results considered by management. Refer to <I>Results of Operations </I>for a discussion of
each reconciling item:

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Cash generated by operating activities was $325&nbsp;million in 2010 and $835&nbsp;million in 2009, and
included approximately $1.6&nbsp;billion of litigation-related net payments in 2010, as compared to
approximately $800&nbsp;million in 2009, as well as the receipt of an
acquisition-related  milestone payment of $250&nbsp;million.
Our cash generated by operations continues to be a significant source of funds for servicing our
outstanding debt obligations and investing in our growth. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had total
debt of $5.438&nbsp;billion, cash and cash equivalents of $213&nbsp;million and working capital of $1.006
billion. During 2010, we completed the refinancing of the majority of our 2011 debt maturities,
establishing a $1.0&nbsp;billion term loan and syndicating a new $2.0&nbsp;billion revolving credit facility,
and prepaid in full our $900&nbsp;million loan from Abbott and all $600&nbsp;million of our senior notes due
in June&nbsp;2011. Further, in January&nbsp;2011, we paid at maturity $250&nbsp;million of our senior notes. In
2009, Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s upgraded our credit rating to investment grade with a stable outlook. In
2010, Fitch Ratings upgraded our outlook to positive from stable, and Moody&#146;s raised our liquidity
rating to its highest level. We believe these rating improvements reflect the strength of our
product portfolio, our commitment to debt reduction, our improving financial fundamentals, and the
progress we are making towards driving profitable sales growth.

vascular disease, structural heart disease, sudden cardiac arrest, and women&#146;s health. In late 2010
and early 2011, we announced the acquisitions of Asthmatx, Inc.; Sadra Medical, Inc.; Atritech,
Inc.; and Intelect Medical, Inc., targeting many of the above conditions and disease states. Each
of these acquisitions is discussed in the <I>Business and Market Overview </I>section below.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In January&nbsp;2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for a
purchase price of $1.5&nbsp;billion in cash. We received $1.450&nbsp;billion at closing, including an upfront
payment of $1.426&nbsp;billion, and $24&nbsp;million which was placed into escrow to be released upon the
completion of local closings in certain foreign jurisdictions, and will receive an additional $50
million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which we
expect will be completed over a period of approximately 24&nbsp;months. We will provide transitional
services through a transition services agreement, and will also supply products to Stryker. These
transition services and supply agreements are expected to be effective for a period of up to 24
months following the closing of the transaction, subject to extension. Due to our continuing
involvement in the operations of the Neurovascular business, the divestiture does not meet the
criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation. Refer to
<I>Note C &#150; Divestitures and Assets
Held for Sale </I>to our 2010 consolidated financial statements
included  in Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual
Report for more information.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM)</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our CRM division develops, manufactures and markets a variety of implantable devices that monitor
the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities. Worldwide net sales of these
products of $2.180&nbsp;billion represented approximately 28&nbsp;percent of our consolidated net sales in
2010. Our worldwide CRM net sales decreased $233&nbsp;million, or ten percent, in 2010, as compared to
2009. Foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact our CRM net sales in 2010, as
compared to the prior year. This decrease was driven primarily by the negative impact of the ship
hold and product removal actions associated with our ICD and CRT-D systems earlier in the year. We
experienced market share loss in the U.S. as a result of these actions; however, we believe that
our products, including our COGNIS&#174; CRT-D and TELIGEN&#174; ICD systems, among the world&#146;s smallest and
thinnest high-energy devices, will continue to be successful in the global market.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">While we have recaptured a portion of our lost market share, the extent and timing of our recovery
is difficult to predict. We estimate that our U.S. defibrillator market share exiting 2010
decreased approximately 300 basis points, as compared to our market share exiting 2009, due
primarily to these product actions. Further, overall expectations of future CRM market growth have
declined, driven primarily by competitive and other pricing pressures, as well as fewer launches of
market-expanding technologies than previously anticipated. We estimate that the worldwide CRM
market approximated $11.4&nbsp;billion in 2010, representing a slight increase over the 2009 market size
of $11.1&nbsp;billion. In addition, physician reaction to study results published by the <I>Journal of the
American Medical Association </I>regarding evidence-based guidelines for ICD implants and the U.S.
Department of Justice investigation into ICD implants may have a negative impact on the CRM market.
However, in September&nbsp;2010, we received FDA approval for an exclusive expanded indication for use
of our CRT-D systems with certain patients in earlier stages of heart failure. We believe this
indication could potentially create an opportunity to expand the worldwide CRM market by
approximately $250&nbsp;million to $350&nbsp;million over the next few years, and further enhance our
position within that market.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our U.S. CRM net sales decreased $237&nbsp;million, or 15&nbsp;percent, in 2010 as compared to 2009,
driven primarily by the ship hold and product removal actions involving our ICD and CRT-D systems,
discussed above. We are committed to advancing our technologies to strengthen our CRM business. In
2010, we continued to execute on our product pipeline and expect to launch our next-generation line
of defibrillators in the U.S. in late 2011 or early 2012, which include new features designed to
improve functionality, diagnostic capability and ease of use. Due in part to anticipated changes to
current FDA regulatory requirements industry-wide, which would increase the number of patients and
length of time needed for certain clinical studies, we now expect to launch our next-generation
INGENIO&#153; pacemaker system, which leverages the strength of our high-voltage platform and will be
compatible with our LATITUDE&#174; Patient Management System, in the U.S. in late 2011 or early 2012,
depending on final FDA requirements. Refer to <I>Regulatory
Environment </I>included in Item&nbsp;1 of this
Annual Report for more information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our international CRM net sales increased $4&nbsp;million, or less than one percent, in 2010, as
compared to 2009. International net sales of our defibrillator systems increased $18&nbsp;million, or
three percent, in 2010, as compared to 2009, driven by strong market acceptance of our COGNIS&#174;
CRT-D and TELIGEN&#174; ICD systems, and our recently-launched 4-SITE lead delivery system. In addition,
in July&nbsp;2009, we received CE Mark approval for our LATITUDE&#174; Patient Management System and have
since launched this technology in the majority of our European markets. The LATITUDE&#174; technology,
which is designed to enable physicians to monitor device performance remotely while patients are in
their homes, is a key component of many of our CRM systems. In late 2010, we received CE Mark
approval for our next-generation line of defibrillators, INCEPTA&#153;, ENERGEN&#153; and PUNCTUA&#153;, and plan
to launch these products in our Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA)&nbsp;region and certain
Inter-Continental countries in the first half of 2011. These products provide physicians and their
patients with more options to customize therapy and enhance our market advantage in size, shape and
longevity. We also plan to launch our next-generation INGENIO&#153; pacemaker system in these regions in
the second half of 2011 and believe that these launches position us well within the worldwide CRM
market.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Net sales from our CRM products represent a significant source of our overall net sales. Therefore,
increases or decreases in our CRM net sales could have a significant impact on our results of

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our coronary stent system offerings include
the VeriFLEX&#153;
(Libert&#233;&#174;) bare-metal coronary stent system,
designed to enhance deliverability and conformability, particularly in challenging lesions, as well
as drug-eluting coronary stent systems. We are the only company in the industry to offer a two-drug
platform strategy, which has enabled us to maintain our leadership position in the drug-eluting
stent market. We currently market our TAXUS&#174; paclitaxel-eluting stent line, including our
third-generation TAXUS&#174; Element&#153; stent system, launched in our EMEA region and certain
Inter-Continental countries during the second quarter of 2010. The CE Mark approval for our TAXUS&#174;
Element&#153; stent system includes a specific indication for treatment in diabetic patients. We also
offer our everolimus-eluting stent line, consisting of the PROMUS&#174; stent system, currently supplied
to us by Abbott Laboratories, and our next-generation internally-developed and manufactured
everolimus-eluting stent system, the PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; stent system, which we launched in our EMEA
region and certain Inter-Continental countries in the fourth quarter of 2009. In September&nbsp;2010, we
received CE Mark approval for expanded indications for the use of our PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; stent system
in diabetic and heart attack patients. Our Element&#153; stent platform incorporates a unique platinum
chromium alloy designed to offer greater radial strength and flexibility than older alloys,
enhanced visibility and reduced recoil. The innovative stent design improves deliverability and
allows for more consistent lesion coverage and drug distribution. These product offerings
demonstrate our commitment to drug-eluting stent market leadership and continued innovation. We
expect to launch our TAXUS&#174; Element&#153; stent system in the U.S. (to be commercialized as ION&#153;) in
mid-2011 and Japan in late 2011 or early 2012. We expect to launch our PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; stent
system in the U.S. and Japan in mid-2012.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Net sales of our coronary stent systems, including bare-metal stent systems, of $1.670&nbsp;billion
represented approximately 21&nbsp;percent of our consolidated net sales in 2010. Worldwide sales of
these products decreased $209&nbsp;million, or 11&nbsp;percent, in 2010, as compared to the prior year.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which contributed $26&nbsp;million to our
coronary stent system net sales in 2010, as compared to 2009, net sales of these products decreased
12&nbsp;percent, as compared to the prior year. Despite continued competition and pricing pressures
resulting in a decline in sales of these products, we maintained our leadership position in 2010
with an estimated 36&nbsp;percent share of the worldwide drug-eluting stent market, as compared to 41
percent in 2009. We estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market approximated $5.0&nbsp;billion in
2010, consistent with the 2009 market size. The size of the coronary stent market is driven
primarily by the number of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)&nbsp;procedures performed, as well
as the percentage of those in which stents are implanted; the number of devices used per procedure;
average selling prices; and the drug-eluting stent penetration

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">Our U.S. net sales of drug-eluting stent systems decreased $106&nbsp;million, or 12&nbsp;percent, in
2010, as compared to 2009. This decrease resulted primarily from a decline in our share of the U.S.
drug-eluting stent market, as well as an overall decrease in the size of this market, resulting
principally from lower average selling prices driven by competitive and other pricing pressures. We
estimate our share of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market approximated 46&nbsp;percent for the last five
quarters, as compared to an average of 49&nbsp;percent during 2009, and estimate that the average
selling price of drug-eluting stent systems in the U.S. decreased approximately nine percent in
2010, as compared to 2009. This decline was due primarily to lower sales of our TAXUS&#174; drug-eluting
stent systems, which we believe was due to customer perceptions of data from a single-center,
non-double-blinded, underpowered study sponsored by one of our competitors. We believe that average
drug-eluting stent penetration rates in the U.S. were 77&nbsp;percent in 2010, as compared to an average
of 75&nbsp;percent during 2009, which partially offset the impact of lower average selling prices on the
size of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market. We believe we have maintained our leadership position
in this market due to the success of our two-drug platform strategy and the breadth of our product
offerings, including the industry&#146;s widest range of coronary stent sizes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our international drug-eluting stent system net sales decreased $65&nbsp;million, or eight percent, in
2010, as compared to 2009. Net sales of our drug-eluting stent systems in Japan decreased $49
million, or 19&nbsp;percent, in 2010, as compared to the prior year and our estimated share of the
drug-eluting stent market in Japan declined to an average of 39&nbsp;percent in 2010 (exiting at 36
percent), as compared to an average of 49&nbsp;percent in 2009 (exiting at 44&nbsp;percent). We believe that
aggressive pricing offered by market entrants and clinical trial enrollment limiting our access to
certain customers contributed to the decline in our market share in Japan in 2010, as compared to
the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by our first quarter 2010 launch of the PROMUS&#174;
stent system in Japan, enabling us to begin the execution of our two-drug platform strategy in this
region. Our net sales of drug-eluting stent systems in our EMEA region decreased $26&nbsp;million, or
eight percent in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to declines in average selling prices,
partially offset by increased penetration rates. However, in the second quarter of 2010, we
launched our third-generation TAXUS&#174; Element&#153; stent system in our EMEA region and certain
Inter-Continental countries. We believe that this launch, coupled with the November&nbsp;2009 launch of
our PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; stent system, which has quickly gained market share, exiting 2010 with
approximately one quarter share of the drug-eluting stent market in EMEA, position us well in this
market going forward. Net sales of drug-eluting stent systems in our Inter-Continental region
increased $10&nbsp;million, or five percent, driven by an increase in penetration rates and procedural
volume.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We market the PROMUS&#174; everolimus-eluting coronary stent system, a private-labeled XIENCE V&#174; stent
system supplied to us by Abbott Laboratories. As of the closing of Abbott&#146;s 2006 acquisition of
Guidant Corporation&#146;s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, we obtained a
perpetual license to the intellectual property used in Guidant&#146;s drug-eluting stent system program
purchased by Abbott. We believe that being the only company to offer two distinct drug-eluting
stent platforms provides us a considerable advantage in the drug-eluting stent market and has
enabled us to sustain our worldwide leadership position. However, under the terms of our supply
arrangement with Abbott, the gross profit and operating profit margin of everolimus-eluting stent
systems supplied to us by Abbott, including any improvements or iterations approved for sale during
the term of the applicable supply arrangements and of the type that could be approved by a supplement
to an approved FDA pre-market approval, is significantly lower than that of our TAXUS&#174; and PROMUS&#174;
Element&#153; stent systems. Specifically, the PROMUS&#174; stent system has operating profit margins that
approximate half of our TAXUS&#174; stent system operating profit margin. Therefore, if sales of

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">us by Abbott increase in relation to our total
drug-eluting stent system sales, our profit margins will decrease. Refer to our <I>Gross Profit</I>
discussion for more information on the impact this sales mix has had on our gross profit margins.
Our internally-developed and manufactured PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; everolimus-eluting stent system,
launched in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries in the fourth quarter of 2009,
generates gross profit margins more favorable than the PROMUS&#174; stent system and we expect will
positively affect our overall gross profit and operating profit margins in these
regions as sales shift from PROMUS&#174; to PROMUS&#174; Element&#153;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Further, the price we pay for our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems from Abbott is
determined by contracts with Abbott and is based, in part, on previously fixed estimates of
Abbott&#146;s manufacturing costs for everolimus-eluting stent systems and third-party reports of our
average selling price of these stent systems. Amounts paid pursuant to this pricing arrangement are
subject to a retroactive adjustment approximately every two years based on Abbott&#146;s actual costs to
manufacture these stent systems for us and our average selling price of everolimus-eluting stent
systems supplied to us by Abbott. Our gross profit margin may be positively or negatively impacted
in the future as a result of this adjustment process.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are currently reliant on Abbott for our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems in the U.S.
and Japan. Our supply agreement with Abbott for everolimus-eluting stent systems in the U.S. and
Japan extends through the end of the second quarter of 2012. At present, we believe that our supply
of everolimus-eluting stent systems from Abbott, coupled with our current launch plans for our
internally-developed and manufactured PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; everolimus-eluting stent system, is
sufficient to meet customer demand. However, any production or capacity issues that affect Abbott&#146;s
manufacturing capabilities or our process for forecasting, ordering and receiving shipments may
impact the ability to increase or decrease our level of supply in a timely manner; therefore, our
supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott may not align with customer
demand, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Further, a delay in the launch
of our internally-developed and manufactured PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; everolimus-eluting stent system in
the U.S. and Japan, currently expected in mid-2012, could result in an inability to meet customer
demand for everolimus-eluting stent systems.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with
significant market share volatility. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we
conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient
populations and trial end points. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future
clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors or third parties, or the market&#146;s perception of
these clinical data, may adversely impact our position in, and share of, the drug-eluting stent
market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market.

matters, including multiple matters with Johnson &#038; Johnson; all outstanding litigation between us
and Medtronic, Inc. with respect to interventional cardiology and endovascular repair cases; and
all outstanding litigation between us and Bruce Saffran, M.D., Ph.D. However, there continues to be
significant intellectual property litigation particularly in the coronary stent market. In
particular, although we have resolved multiple litigation matters with Johnson &#038; Johnson, we
continue to be involved in patent litigation with them, particularly relating to drug-eluting stent
systems. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on
our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

decreased to $932&nbsp;million in 2010, as compared to $980&nbsp;million in 2009, a decrease of $48&nbsp;million,
or five percent. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations which contributed $12
million to our Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) net sales in 2010, as
compared to the prior year, net sales of these products decreased $60&nbsp;million, or six percent. Our
U.S. net sales of these products were $394&nbsp;million in 2010, as compared to $409&nbsp;million in 2009.
Our international net sales of these products were $538&nbsp;million in 2010, as compared to $571
million for the prior year. This decrease was the result of a delay in new product introductions,
pricing pressures and competitive product launches. We continue to hold a strong leadership
position in the PTCA balloon catheter market, maintaining an
estimated 56&nbsp;percent average share of
the U.S. market and 38&nbsp;percent worldwide in 2010. We have executed and are planning a number of
additional new product launches during 2011, including the full launch of our Apex&#153; pre-dilatation
balloon catheter with platinum marker bands for improved radiopacity, launched in limited markets
during the second quarter of 2010. In June&nbsp;2010, we launched the NC Quantum Apex&#153; post-dilatation
balloon catheter, developed specifically to address physicians&#146; needs in optimizing coronary stent deployment, which
has been received positively in the market. In addition, we began a phased launch of our Kinetix&#153;
family of guidewires in the U.S., our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries in April
2010.

increases were due primarily to higher net sales within our stent franchise, driven by the
continued commercialization and adoption of our WallFlex&#174; family of stents, in particular, the
WallFlex Biliary line and WallFlex Esophageal line. In addition, our hemostasis franchise net sales
benefited from increased utilization of our Resolution<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> Clip Device, an endoscopic mechanical clip

action plan relating to three site-specific warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. We
identified solutions to the quality system issues cited by the FDA and implemented those solutions
throughout our organization. During 2008, the FDA reinspected a number of our facilities and, in
October&nbsp;2008, informed us that our quality system was in substantial compliance with its Quality
System Regulations. In November&nbsp;2009 and January&nbsp;2010, the FDA reinspected two of our sites to
follow-up on observations from the 2008 FDA inspections. Both of these FDA inspections confirmed

selling, general and administrative expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately $500
million exiting 2008. We have partially reinvested our savings from these initiatives into targeted
head count increases, primarily in customer-facing positions. In addition, we expect reductions of
annualized run-rate manufacturing costs of approximately $35&nbsp;million exiting 2010 as a result of
transfers of certain production lines. Due to the longer term
nature of these initiatives, we do not expect to achieve the full benefit of these reductions in
manufacturing costs until 2012. We initiated activities under the plan in the fourth quarter of
2007. The transfer of certain production lines contemplated under the 2007 Restructuring plan was
completed as of December&nbsp;31, 2010; all other major

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability
Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. Certain provisions of the legislation
will not be effective for a number of years and there are many programs and requirements for which
the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not fully understood, and it is
unclear what the full impact will be from the legislation. The legislation imposes on medical
device manufacturers a 2.3&nbsp;percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class&nbsp;I, II and III medical devices
beginning in 2013. U.S. net sales represented 56&nbsp;percent of our worldwide net sales in 2010 and,
therefore, this tax burden may have a material negative impact on our results of operations and
cash flows. Other provisions of this legislation, including Medicare provisions aimed at improving
quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory
board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, could meaningfully change
the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and may adversely affect our business and results of
operations. Further, we cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately
implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in
the U.S. or internationally. However, any changes that lower reimbursements for our products or
reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We manage our international operating segments on a constant currency basis, and we manage market
risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level. Management excludes the impact of
foreign exchange for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to
facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating
performance. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of currency exchange, we
convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using current
period currency exchange rates. The regional constant currency growth rates in the tables below can
be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented
in <I>Note P &#150; Segment
Reporting </I>to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report.
As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had four reportable segments based on geographic regions: the United
States; EMEA, consisting of Europe, the Middle East and Africa; Japan; and Inter-Continental,
consisting of our Asia Pacific and the Americas operating segments. The reportable segments
represent an aggregate of all operating divisions within each segment.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During 2010, our U.S. net sales decreased $340&nbsp;million, or seven percent, as compared to 2009. The
decrease was driven primarily by lower U.S. CRM net sales of $237&nbsp;million, due primarily to the
ship hold and product removal actions impacting our ICD and CRT-D systems discussed above, as well
as a decline in U.S. coronary stent system net sales of $119&nbsp;million, due primarily to a decline in
our share of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market as well as lower average selling prices. In
addition, U.S. net sales of our Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems)
business decreased $15&nbsp;million in 2010, as compared to the prior year. These decreases were
partially offset by increases of U.S. net sales in 2010 from our Endoscopy business of $24&nbsp;million,
$12&nbsp;million attributable to our Urology/Women&#146;s Health business, and $17&nbsp;million of growth in our

increase was driven primarily by an increase in U.S. CRM net sales of $125&nbsp;million and an increase
of $47&nbsp;million in U.S. net sales of our coronary stent systems. In addition, U.S. net sales in 2009
from our Endoscopy business grew $40&nbsp;million, our Urology/Women&#146;s Health net sales increased $18
million, and our Neuromodulation division
increased U.S. net sales $37&nbsp;million in 2009, as compared to 2008. These increases were partially offset by
declines in U.S. net sales from our Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems)

sales in Japan decreased $81&nbsp;million, or eight percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to competitive launches of drug-eluting
stent system technology and clinical trial enrollment limiting our access to certain drug-eluting

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The primary factor contributing to the reduction in our gross profit margin during 2010 and
2009, as compared to the prior years, was, in each year, a further decrease in sales of our
higher-margin TAXUS&#174; drug-eluting stent systems and an increasing shift towards the PROMUS&#174; stent
system, as well as declines in the average selling prices of drug-eluting stent systems. Sales of
the PROMUS&#174; stent system represented approximately 52&nbsp;percent of our worldwide drug-eluting stent
system sales in 2010, 40&nbsp;percent in 2009, and 19&nbsp;percent in 2008. As a result of the terms of our
supply arrangement with Abbott, the gross profit margin of a PROMUS&#174; stent system, supplied to us
by Abbott, is significantly lower than that of our TAXUS&#174; stent system. In the fourth quarter of
2009, we launched our next-generation internally-developed and manufactured PROMUS&#174; Element&#153;

positively affected our overall gross profit and operating profit margins. We expect to launch our
PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; stent system in the U.S. and Japan in mid-2012. In addition, the average selling
prices of drug-eluting stent systems have decreased, including an estimated nine percent decline in
the U.S., in 2010, as compared to 2009. Our gross profit margin in 2010 was also
negatively impacted by the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our U.S. CRM
business previously discussed.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2010, our SG&#038;A expenses decreased $55&nbsp;million, or two percent, as compared to 2009. This
decrease was related primarily to savings from our restructuring initiatives driven by lower
head count and lower consulting and travel spending, as compared to the prior year. These decreases
were partially offset by an $11&nbsp;million unfavorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations. As a
percentage of net sales, our SG&#038;A expenses were slightly higher than 2009 due to the impact of
maintaining compensation levels for our U.S. CRM sales force, despite the reduction in our net
sales of our CRM products in the U.S. We plan to increase our investment in SG&#038;A in 2011 to
introduce new products; strengthen our sales organization in emerging markets such as Brazil, China
and India; and to support our acquired businesses; as a result, our SG&#038;A expenses are likely to
increase slightly as a percentage of net sales in 2011, as compared to 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2009, our SG&#038;A expenses increased by $46&nbsp;million, or two percent, as compared to 2008. This
increase was related primarily to the addition of direct selling expenses and head count, including
expanding our global sales force and an increase in costs associated with various
litigation-related matters. These increases were partially offset by a benefit from foreign
currency fluctuations of approximately $22&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Research and Development (R&#038;D) Expenses</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2010, our R&#038;D expenses decreased $96&nbsp;million, or nine percent, as compared to 2009. This
decrease was due to the on-going re-prioritization of R&#038;D projects and the re-allocation of
spending as part of our efforts to focus on products with higher returns, as well as the delay of
certain of our clinical trials. We remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing
in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a
healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2009, our R&#038;D expenses increased $29&nbsp;million, or three percent, as compared to 2008. As a
percentage of net sales, our R&#038;D expenses in 2009 were relatively flat with the prior year.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2010, our royalty expense decreased $6&nbsp;million, or three percent, as compared to 2009. This
decrease was due primarily to lower sales of our drug-eluting coronary stent systems, partially
offset by the continued shift in the mix of our drug-eluting stent system sales towards the
PROMUS<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> and PROMUS&#174; Element&#153; stent systems. The
royalty rate applied to sales of these stent systems is, on average, higher than that associated
with sales of our

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2009, our royalty expense decreased $12&nbsp;million, or six percent, as compared to 2008. The
decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in royalty expense of $29&nbsp;million attributable to
the expiration of a CRM royalty agreement during the first quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting
this decrease was an increase in royalty expense of $20&nbsp;million as a result of an increase in sales
of our drug-eluting stent systems, as well as the shift in the mix of our drug-eluting stent system
sales towards the
PROMUS<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> stent system, following its launch in the U.S. in
mid-2008.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In the second quarter of 2009, we discontinued one of our internal R&#038;D programs in order to focus
on those with a higher likelihood of success. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $16
million, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)&nbsp;Accounting Standards
Codification (ASC)&nbsp;Topic 420, <I>Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations </I>(formerly FASB Statement No.&nbsp;146,
<I>Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities</I>)<I>, </I>associated with future payments
that we believe we remain contractually obligated to make. We continue to focus on developing new

believe that the cancellation of this program will have a material adverse impact on our future
results of operations or cash flows.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Amortization expense was $513&nbsp;million in 2010, as compared to $511&nbsp;million in 2009, an increase of
$2&nbsp;million, or less than one percent. This non-cash charge is excluded by management for purposes
of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Amortization expense was $511&nbsp;million in 2009, as compared to $543&nbsp;million in 2008, a decrease of
$32&nbsp;million, or six percent. This decrease was due primarily to the impact of certain
Interventional Cardiology-related intangible assets reaching the end of their accounting useful
life during 2008, as well as the write-down of certain intangible assets to their fair values in
2009 and 2008, described in <I>Other Intangible Asset Impairment Charges </I>below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Goodwill Impairment Charges</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We test our April 1 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or
more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may
exist. The ship hold and product removal actions associated with our U.S. ICD and CRT-D products,
which we announced on March&nbsp;15, 2010, and the expected corresponding financial impact on our
operations created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to
our U.S. CRM reporting unit. Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with
our accounting policies and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1.817&nbsp;billion, on both a
pre-tax and after-tax basis, associated with our U.S. CRM reporting unit. This charge does not
impact our compliance with our debt covenants or our cash flows, and is excluded by management for
purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At the time we performed our interim goodwill impairment test, we estimated that our U.S.
defibrillator market share would decrease approximately 400 basis points exiting 2010 as a result
of the ship hold and product removal actions, as compared to our market share exiting 2009, and
that these actions would negatively impact our 2010 U.S. CRM revenues by approximately $300
million. In addition, we expected that, our on-going U.S. CRM net sales and profitability would
likely continue to be adversely impacted as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions.
Therefore, as a result of these product actions, as well as lower expectations of market growth in
new areas and increased competitive and other pricing pressures, we lowered our estimated average
U.S. CRM net sales growth rates within our 15-year discounted cash flow (DCF)&nbsp;model, as well as our
terminal

value of the U.S. CRM reporting unit. The reduction in our forecasted 2010 U.S. CRM net sales, the
change in our expected sales growth rates thereafter and the reduction in profitability as a result
of the recently enacted excise tax on medical device
manufacturers were several key factors contributing to the impairment charge. Partially offsetting
these factors was a 50 basis point reduction in our estimated market-participant risk-adjusted
weighted-average cost of capital (WACC)&nbsp;used in determining our discount rate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In the second quarter of 2010, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our
reporting units. We updated our U.S. CRM assumptions to reflect our market share position at that
time, our most recent operational budgets and long range strategic plans. In conjunction with our
annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, with the exception
of our U.S. CRM reporting unit. Based on the remaining book value of our U.S. CRM reporting unit
following the goodwill impairment charge, the carrying value of our U.S. CRM business unit
continues to exceed its fair value, due primarily to the book value of amortizable intangible
assets allocated to this reporting unit. The book value of our amortizable intangible assets which
have been allocated to our U.S. CRM reporting unit is approximately $3.5&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31,
2010. We tested these amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an undiscounted cash flow
basis as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, and determined that these assets were not impaired, and there have been
no impairment indicators related to these assets subsequent to that test. The assumptions used in
our annual goodwill impairment test related to our U.S. CRM reporting unit were substantially
consistent with those used in our first quarter interim impairment test; therefore, it was not
deemed necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test in the second quarter of
2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In the fourth quarter of 2010, we performed an interim impairment test on our international
reporting units as a result of the announced divestiture of our Neurovascular business. We
allocated a portion of our goodwill from our each of our international reporting units to the
Neurovascular business. We then tested each of our international reporting units for impairment in
accordance with ASC Topic 350, <I>Intangibles &#150; Goodwill and Other</I>. Our testing did not identify any
reporting units whose carrying values exceeded their calculated fair values. Refer to <I>Critical
Accounting Estimates </I>for a discussion of our goodwill balances as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, including
our assessment of reporting units with a higher risk of future impairment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During the fourth quarter of 2008, the decline in our stock price and our market capitalization
created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance. Therefore, we performed an
interim impairment test and recorded a $2.613&nbsp;billion goodwill impairment charge associated with
our U.S. CRM reporting unit. The impact of economic conditions, and the related increase in
volatility in the equity and credit markets, on our risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital,
along with reductions in market demand for products in our U.S. CRM reporting unit relative to our
assumptions at the time of our acquisition of Guidant, were the key factors contributing to the
impairment charge.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During the first quarter of 2010, due to lower than anticipated net sales of one of our Peripheral
Interventions technology offerings, as well as changes in our expectations of future market
acceptance of this technology, we lowered our sales forecasts associated with the product. In
addition, during the third quarter of 2010, as part of our initiatives to reprioritize and
diversify our product portfolio, we discontinued one of our internal research and development
programs to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success. As a result of these factors, we
tested the related intangible assets for impairment and recorded $65&nbsp;million of intangible asset
impairment charges during 2010 to write down the balance of these intangible assets to their fair
value. We do not believe that these impairments, or the factors causing these impairments, will
have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows.

research and development assets acquired in a business combination that had no alternative future

now requires that purchased research and development acquired in a business combination be
recognized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the
associated research and development efforts. Accordingly, we have accounted for purchased research

805) did not change this policy with respect to asset purchases. In accordance with this policy, we
recorded purchased research and development charges of $21&nbsp;million in 2009, associated with
entering certain licensing and development arrangements. Since the technology purchases did not
involve the transfer of processes or outputs as defined by Statement No.&nbsp;141(R) (Topic 805), the

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In October&nbsp;2007, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expense and head count
reduction plan (the 2007 Restructuring plan). The plan was intended to bring expenses in line with
revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short- and long-term shareholder value. Key
activities under the plan included the restructuring of several businesses, corporate functions and
product franchises in order to better utilize resources, strengthen competitive positions, and
create a more simplified and efficient business model; the elimination, suspension or reduction of
spending on certain research and development projects; and the transfer of certain production lines
among facilities. The execution of this plan enabled us to reduce research and development and
selling, general and administrative expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately $500
million exiting 2008. We have partially reinvested our savings from these initiatives into targeted
head count increases, primarily in customer-facing positions. In addition, the plan has reduced
annualized run-rate reductions of manufacturing costs by approximately $35&nbsp;million exiting 2010 as
a result of transfers of certain production lines. We initiated activities under the plan in the
fourth quarter of 2007. The transfer of certain production lines contemplated under the 2007
Restructuring plan was completed as of December&nbsp;31, 2010; all
other major activities under the plan, with the exception of final
production line transfers, were completed as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The execution of this plan resulted in total pre-tax expenses of $427&nbsp;million and required cash
outlays of $380&nbsp;million, of which we have paid $370&nbsp;million to date. We recorded a portion of these
expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our
consolidated statements of operations. The following provides a summary of total costs associated

Optimization program, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by
transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities. The
program is a complement to our 2007 Restructuring plan, discussed above, and is intended to improve
overall gross profit margins. We estimate that the program will result in annualized run-rate
reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $65&nbsp;million exiting 2012. These

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On February&nbsp;6, 2010, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a series of
management changes and restructuring initiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to focus
our business, drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and
shareholder value. Key activities under the plan include the integration of our Cardiovascular and
CRM businesses, as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions;
the centralization of our research and development organization; the re-alignment of our
international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities
including significant investments in emerging markets; and the reprioritization and diversification
of our product portfolio. We estimate that the execution of this plan will result in gross
reductions in pre-tax operating expenses of approximately $200&nbsp;million to $250&nbsp;million, once
completed in 2012. We expect to reinvest a portion of the savings
into customer-facing and other
activities to help drive future sales growth and support the business. Activities under the 2010
Restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and are expected to be substantially
complete by the end of 2012. We expect the execution of the 2010 Restructuring plan will result in
the elimination of approximately 1,000 to 1,300 positions worldwide by the end of 2012.

will result in cash outlays, of which we have made payments of $69&nbsp;million to date. We have

of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Restructuring and restructuring-related costs recorded in 2008 related entirely to our 2007
Restructuring plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Termination benefits represent amounts incurred pursuant to our on-going benefit arrangements and
amounts for one-time involuntary termination benefits, and have been recorded in accordance with
ASC Topic 712, <I>Compensation &#150; Non-retirement Postemployment Benefits </I>(formerly FASB Statement No.
112, <I>Employer&#146;s Accounting for Postemployment Benefits</I>) and ASC Topic 420, <I>Exit or Disposal Cost
Obligations </I>(formerly FASB Statement 146, <I>Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities</I>). We expect to record additional termination benefits related to our Plant Network
Optimization program and 2010 Restructuring plan in 2011 and 2012 when we identify with more
specificity the job classifications, functions and locations of the remaining head count to be
eliminated. Retention incentives represent cash incentives, which were recorded over the service
period during which eligible employees remained employed with us in order to retain the payment.
Other restructuring costs, which represent primarily consulting fees, are being recorded as
incurred in accordance with Topic 420. Accelerated depreciation is being recorded over the adjusted
remaining useful life of the related assets, and production line transfer costs are being recorded
as incurred.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We
have incurred cumulative restructuring charges of $433&nbsp;million and restructuring-related costs
of $183&nbsp;million since we committed to each plan. The following presents these costs by major type

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We record certain significant litigation-related activity as a separate line item in our
consolidated statements of operations, and these charges are excluded by management for purposes of
evaluating operating performance. During 2010, we reached a settlement with Medinol Ltd., resolving
the dispute we had with them that had been subject of arbitration before the American Arbitration
Association. Under the terms of the settlement, we received proceeds of $104&nbsp;million from Medinol,
which we recorded as a pre-tax gain in our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item
8 of this Annual Report.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2009, we recorded litigation-related net charges of $2.022&nbsp;billion, associated primarily with an
agreement to settle three patent disputes with Johnson &#038; Johnson for $1.725&nbsp;billion, plus interest.
In addition, in 2009, we reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice,
which was formally accepted by the District Court in 2011, under which we paid $296&nbsp;million in
January&nbsp;2011 in order resolve the U.S. Government investigation of Guidant Corporation related to
product advisories issued in 2005. We recorded a net charge of $294&nbsp;million related to this matter
in 2009, representing $296&nbsp;million associated with the agreement, net of a $2&nbsp;million reversal of a
related accrual. Further, in 2009, we reduced previously recorded reserves associated with certain
litigation-related matters following certain favorable court rulings, resulting in a credit of $60
million and recorded a pre-tax charge of $50&nbsp;million associated with the settlement of all
outstanding litigation with Bruce Saffran, M.D., Ph.D.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2008, we recorded litigation-related charges of $334&nbsp;million as a result of a ruling by a
federal judge in a patent infringement case brought against us by Johnson &#038; Johnson. This charge
was in addition to previous charges related to this matter. In 2009, we made the associated
settlement payment of $716&nbsp;million, including penalties and interest. See discussion of our
material legal proceedings in <I>Note L &#150; Commitments and Contingencies </I>to our 2010 consolidated
financial statements included in Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our interest expense decreased to $393&nbsp;million in 2010, as compared to $407&nbsp;million in 2009. The
decrease in our interest expense was a result of lower average debt levels, due to term loan
prepayments throughout 2009, as well as the 2010 prepayment of our $900&nbsp;million loan from Abbott
Laboratories and a slight decrease in our average borrowing rate. Our average borrowing rate was
6.0&nbsp;percent in 2010 and 6.1&nbsp;percent in 2009. In addition, our 2010 interest expense included $15
million of write-offs of debt issuance costs and impacts of the early termination of interest rate
contracts associated with term loan prepayments during the year, as compared to $34&nbsp;million in
2009. These decreases were partially offset by the write-off of the related remaining $10&nbsp;million
discount attributable to

decrease in our interest expense was a result of lower average debt levels, due to term loan
repayments during 2009. Partially offsetting these decreases were losses of $27&nbsp;million associated
with the early termination of interest rate contracts for which there was no longer an underlying
exposure and the write-off of $7&nbsp;million of debt issuance costs following prepayments of our term
loan, as well as a slight increase in our average borrowing rate. Our average borrowing rate was
6.1&nbsp;percent in 2009 and 6.0&nbsp;percent in 2008.

interest income increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily
to the collection of interest on outstanding accounts receivable. Our
interest income decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily
to lower average
investment rates available in the market, as well as lower average cash balances.
Other, net included net losses of $12&nbsp;million in 2010, net gains of $3&nbsp;million in 2009 and net
losses of $93&nbsp;million in 2008, associated with our investment portfolio. The $93&nbsp;million of losses

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The change in our reported tax rate for 2010, as compared to 2009, and 2009, as compared to
2008, relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different
rates than our effective tax rate. In 2010, these receipts and charges included goodwill and
intangible asset impairment charges, a gain associated with the receipt of an acquisition-related
milestone payment, a gain associated with a litigation-related settlement receipt, and
restructuring-related charges. Our reported tax rate was also net favorably affected by discrete
items, related primarily to the re-measurement of an uncertain tax position resulting from a
favorable court ruling issued in a similar third-party case, a resolution of an uncertain tax
position resulting from a favorable taxpayer motion issued in a similar third-party case as well as
conclusion of the appeals process for the federal examination for certain years. In 2009, these
receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, purchased research and
development charges, restructuring and litigation-related net charges, a favorable tax ruling on a
divestiture-related gain recognized in a prior period, and discrete tax items associated primarily
with resolutions of uncertain tax positions related to audit settlements and changes in estimates
for tax benefits

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">claimed related to prior periods. In 2008, these charges included gains and losses associated with
the divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses and investments, goodwill and intangible asset
impairment charges, litigation-related charges. Changes in the geographic mix of our sales also
impacted our reported tax rate in 2010, as compared to 2009, and in 2009, as compared to 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign
jurisdictions. We have concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters through 2000 and substantially
all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters through 2001. We resolved a number of
foreign examinations during 2010. As a result of these activities, we decreased our reserve for
uncertain tax positions by $9&nbsp;million, inclusive of $3&nbsp;million of interest and penalties. In
addition, as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations in various foreign and state
jurisdictions, we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by $20&nbsp;million, inclusive of $7
million of interest and penalties. Further, during 2010, we concluded the appeals process for the
federal tax examination for Boston Scientific (excluding Guidant) covering years 2002-2005 and
decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by $72&nbsp;million, inclusive of $21&nbsp;million of
interest and penalties, net of payments. We also re-measured an uncertain tax position due to a
favorable court ruling issued in a similar third-party case and resolved another uncertain tax
position resulting from a favorable taxpayer motion issued in a similar third-party case, which
resulted in a decrease of $91&nbsp;million, inclusive of $25&nbsp;million of interest and penalties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During 2009, we received favorable foreign court decisions and resolved certain foreign matters. As
a result of these activities, we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by $20&nbsp;million,
inclusive of $7&nbsp;million of interest and penalties. In addition, statutes of limitations expired in
various foreign and state jurisdictions, as a result, decreased our reserve for uncertain tax
positions by $29&nbsp;million, inclusive of interest and penalties. We also resolved certain
litigation-related matters, described in our 2009 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. Based on the
outcome of the settlements, we reassessed the reserve for uncertain tax positions previously
recorded on certain positions and decreased our reserve by $22&nbsp;million, inclusive of $1&nbsp;million of
interest.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During 2008, we resolved certain matters in federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions for Guidant
and Boston Scientific for the years 1998- 2005. We settled multiple federal issues at the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS)&nbsp;examination and Appellate levels, including issues related to Guidant&#146;s
acquisition of Intermedics, Inc., and various litigation settlements, described in <I>Note L &#150;
Commitments and Contingencies </I>to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item&nbsp;8 of
this Annual Report, or our 2009 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. We also received favorable
foreign court decisions and a favorable outcome related to our foreign research credit claims. As
a result of these audit activities, we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions, excluding
tax payments, by $156&nbsp;million, inclusive of $37&nbsp;million of interest and penalties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On December&nbsp;17, 2010, we received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS reflecting proposed audit
adjustments for Guidant Corporation for the 2001-2003 tax years. The incremental tax liability
asserted by the IRS is $525&nbsp;million, plus interest. The primary issue in dispute is the transfer
pricing used in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign
subsidiaries of Guidant. We believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we intend
to file a petition to the U.S. Tax Court in early 2011. No payments will be made on the issue
until it is resolved, which may take several years. We believe that our income tax reserves
associated with this matter are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations. However, both the final resolution and
potential impact of that resolution are uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial
condition or results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The federal tax returns of Guidant Corporation for the 2004 through April&nbsp;2006 tax years and of
Boston Scientific Corporation for the 2006-2007 tax years are currently under examination by the
IRS. The relevant statutes of limitations for these examinations expire during December&nbsp;2011 and
September&nbsp;2011, respectively. We do not anticipate that at the conclusion of these examinations,
we will be able to reach an agreement with the IRS regarding our federal tax liabilities for these
years. We expect that final resolution of these tax liabilities will require that we avail
ourselves of applicable IRS appellate and judicial procedures, as appropriate.

$105&nbsp;million invested in prime money market and government funds, $16&nbsp;million invested in
short-term time deposits, and $92&nbsp;million in interest bearing and non-interest bearing bank
accounts. Our policy is to invest excess cash in short-term marketable securities earning a market
rate of interest without assuming undue risk to principal, and we limit our direct exposure to
securities in any one industry or issuer.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Subsequent to year-end, in January&nbsp;2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to
Stryker Corporation and received pre-tax proceeds of $1.450&nbsp;billion at closing, including an
upfront payment of $1.426&nbsp;billion, and $24&nbsp;million, which was placed into escrow to be released
upon the completion of local closings in certain foreign jurisdictions, and will receive $50
million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which we
expect will be completed over a period of approximately 24&nbsp;months. In January&nbsp;2011, we paid at
maturity $250&nbsp;million of our senior notes, and a $296&nbsp;million litigation-related settlement
associated with the U.S. Department of Justice matter described previously, using cash on hand. We

billion to Johnson &#038; Johnson related to a patent litigation settlement, as compared to
approximately $837&nbsp;million of legal settlements paid in 2009. This cash outflow was partially
offset by the receipt of a $250&nbsp;million milestone payment from Abbott and $104&nbsp;million received in
connection with a litigation settlement with Medinol, each described in <I>Results of Operations</I>.

of $837&nbsp;million, consisting primarily of payments to Johnson &#038; Johnson associated with patent
litigation settlements. These cash outflows were partially offset by lower net tax payments of $370
million and lower interest payments of $50&nbsp;million, due to lower average debt balances, as well as
improvements in working capital.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. Physician
customers, particularly in interventional cardiology, have historically moved quickly to new
products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and
trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. However,
intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. Furthermore, appellate
courts can overturn lower court patent decisions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across
product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties.
In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related
proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently
drive settlement not only for individual cases, but also for a series of pending and potentially
related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically
sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial
court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are
difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in
other geographies. Several third parties have asserted that certain of our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them. We have similarly asserted that other
products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us. Adverse outcomes in one
or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain
jurisdictions, or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In particular, although we have resolved multiple litigation matters with Johnson &#038; Johnson, we
continue to be involved in patent litigation with them, particularly relating to drug-eluting stent
systems. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on
our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of
operation or liquidity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In the normal course of business, product liability, securities and commercial claims are asserted
against us. Similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to

claims or adverse decisions. Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation, and
other legal proceedings in the future, regardless of their outcome, could have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, the medical
device industry is the subject of numerous governmental investigations often involving regulatory,
marketing and other business practices. These investigations could result in the commencement of
civil and criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies, divert
the attention of our management and have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations and liquidity.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was $588&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31,
2010 and $2.316&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, and includes estimated costs of settlement,
damages and defense. The decrease in our accrual is due primarily to the payment of $1.725&nbsp;billion
to Johnson &#038; Johnson in connection with the patent litigation settlement discussed in <I>Note L &#150;
Commitments and Contingencies </I>to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item&nbsp;8 of
this Annual Report. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts,
if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and,
therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially
adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and our ability to comply with our debt
covenants. See further discussion of our material legal proceedings in <I>Note L.</I>

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies. We have
adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). We describe these
accounting polices in <I>Note A&#150;Significant Accounting Policies </I>to our 2010 consolidated financial
statements included in Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes
estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported
amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ
from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i)&nbsp;we are required to make
assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii)
materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting
estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas requiring management&#146;s judgment
that we consider critical:

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired
products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these
amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow
customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these
transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based
upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the
customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch
strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related
to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Many of our CRM product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE&#174; Patient
Management System, which represents a future service obligation. In accordance with accounting
guidance regarding multiple-element arrangements applicable through December&nbsp;31, 2010, we deferred
revenue on the undelivered service element based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value,
using the residual method of allocation, and recognized the associated revenue over the related
service period. The use of an alternative method of allocation or estimate of fair value could
result in a different amount of revenue deferral in any given period. On January&nbsp;1, 2011, we
adopted ASC Update No.&nbsp;2009-13, <I>Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)- Multiple-Deliverable Revenue

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of
forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as
compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired
and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is
characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing
of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and
variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete
inventory.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U>Valuation of Intangible Assets</U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination,
including purchased research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and
assumptions provided by management, which consider management&#146;s best estimates of inputs and
assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve
potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal
to the discounted fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make
in the future. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair
value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or
decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in
discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates. The
use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections; growth rates;
cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or probabilities
surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in
different purchase price allocations and amortization expense in current and future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse
conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a
change in the remaining useful life. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible
asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable, as
discussed in <I>Note A, </I>we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified.
In addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and
reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets. To test our indefinite-lived intangible
assets for impairment, we calculate the fair value of these assets and compare the calculated fair
values to the respective carrying values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the
indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future
cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. In determining
our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and
assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the
asset (asset group). The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount
rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of
impairment.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable
intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our April 1 goodwill
balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators
are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the
assessment, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under ASC

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Topic 350, <I>Intangibles-Goodwill and Other </I>(formerly FASB Statement No.&nbsp;142, <I>Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets). </I>The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting
units, as defined, to the fair value of these units. We assess goodwill for impairment at the
reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating
segment, referred to as a component. We determine our reporting units by first identifying our
operating segments, and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business
for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly
reviews the operating results of that component. We aggregate components within an operating
segment that have similar economic characteristics. For our April&nbsp;1, 2010 annual impairment
assessment, we identified our reporting units to be our seven U.S. operating segments, which in
aggregate make up the U.S. reportable segment, and our four international operating segments. When
allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units, we assign goodwill to the
reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of
acquisition. In addition, for purposes of performing our annual goodwill impairment test, assets
and liabilities, including corporate assets, which relate to a reporting unit&#146;s operations, and
would be considered in determining its fair value, are allocated to the individual reporting units.
We allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit, but from
which the reporting unit benefits, based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each
reporting unit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we used only the income approach, specifically the discounted cash
flow (DCF)&nbsp;method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our
goodwill impairment assessment. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax
cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a
present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most
meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most
appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach
and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the
lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the
inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units
for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the
most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair
value of our reporting units.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the
amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate
discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our
most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value
growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our
DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units.
We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average costs of capital (WACC)&nbsp;as a
basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units&#146; future expected cash
flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step
of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step
of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit&#146;s goodwill to
its carrying value. If we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance
of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated,
we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and
disclose that the amount is an estimate. We would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in
subsequent reporting periods, once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the
fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and
can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated
revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair
value estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have identified a total of four reporting units with a material amount of goodwill that are at
higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future
reporting periods. These reporting units include our U.S. CRM unit, which holds $1.5&nbsp;billion of
allocated goodwill, our U.S. Cardiovascular unit, which holds $2.2&nbsp;billion of allocated goodwill,
our U.S. Neuromodulation unit, which holds $1.2&nbsp;billion of allocated

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">goodwill, and our EMEA unit, which holds $3.9&nbsp;billion of allocated goodwill. The level of excess
fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk (with
the exception of the U.S. CRM reporting unit, whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair
value) ranged from approximately six percent to 23&nbsp;percent. On a quarterly basis, we monitor the
key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect changes that would warrant an interim
impairment test. The key variables that drive the fair value of our reporting units are estimated
revenue growth rates, levels of profitability and perpetual growth rate assumptions, as well as the
WACC. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, including our ability to grow revenue and
improve profitability levels. For each of these reporting units, relatively small declines in the
future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or small changes in other key assumptions
may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges. For example, keeping all
other variables constant, a 50 basis point increase in the WACC applied would require that we
perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. CRM, U.S. Neuromodulation, and
EMEA reporting units failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. In addition, keeping
all other variables constant, a 100 basis point decrease in perpetual growth rates would require
that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for all four of the reporting units
with higher risk of impairment. The estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates are
our best estimates and we believe they are reasonable, but future declines in the business
performance of our reporting units may impair the recoverability of our goodwill. See <I>Note D &#150;
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets </I>to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item
8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our 2010 and 2008 goodwill impairment charges, as

reporting units.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain
non-GAAP measures, including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude
certain amounts, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of
foreign exchange. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for,
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The GAAP measure most comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income (loss); the GAAP measure
most comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income (loss)&nbsp;per share. To calculate
regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange, we
convert actual current-period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign
exchange rates. The GAAP measure most comparable to this non-GAAP measure is growth rate
percentages based on GAAP revenue. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to
the corresponding GAAP measure are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP measures to evaluate performance period over period, to
analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our
competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources
and determining compensation. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures to further its
understanding of the performance of operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We compensate for the limitations on non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to
gain a complete picture of performance. The non-GAAP measures focus instead upon the core business,
which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of overall performance. We provide detailed
reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure
elsewhere in this Annual Report, and encourage investors to review these reconciliations.

divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange, in addition to the
related GAAP measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by
management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our
results &#147;through the eyes&#148; of management. We further believe that providing this information better
enables our investors to understand our operating performance and to evaluate the methodology used
by management to evaluate and measure such performance.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have audited Boston Scientific Corporation&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of
December&nbsp;31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#150;Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston
Scientific Corporation&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are
exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these
risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter
derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial
instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we
manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with
a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding
positions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted
foreign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in
certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and
derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency
exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $5.077
billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and $4.742&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. We recorded $82&nbsp;million
of other assets and $189&nbsp;million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these
derivative instruments as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, as compared to $56&nbsp;million of other assets and $110
million of other liabilities as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S.
dollar&#146;s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments&#146; fair
value by $297&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and $271&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. A ten
percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar&#146;s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease
the derivative instruments&#146; fair value by $363&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and by $331&nbsp;million
as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate
sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or
increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction,
resulting in minimal impact on our consolidated statements of operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings, partially offset by U.S. dollar
cash investments, or &#145;net debt.&#146; As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, $4.433&nbsp;billion of our outstanding debt
obligations, or approximately 85&nbsp;percent of our net debt, was at fixed interest rates. We did not
have any interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 or 2009. In the
first quarter of 2011, we entered interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of
$850&nbsp;million to convert fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Principles of Consolidation</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Boston Scientific Corporation and our
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Through December&nbsp;31, 2009, we assessed the terms of our investment
interests to determine if any of our investees met the definition of a variable interest entity
(VIE)&nbsp;in accordance with accounting standards effective through that date, and would have
consolidated any VIEs in which we were the primary beneficiary. Our evaluation considered both
qualitative and quantitative factors and various assumptions, including expected losses and
residual returns. In December&nbsp;2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)&nbsp;issued
Accounting Standards Codification&#153; (ASC)&nbsp;Update No.&nbsp;2009-17, <I>Consolidations (Topic 810) &#150;
Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities, </I>which
formally codifies FASB Statement No.&nbsp;167, <I>Amendments to FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;46(R). </I>Update No.
2009-17 and Statement No.&nbsp;167 amend Interpretation No.&nbsp;46(R), <I>Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, </I>to require that an enterprise perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise&#146;s
variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE. The analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a
VIE as the enterprise that has both 1) the power to direct activities of a VIE that most
significantly impact the entity&#146;s economic performance and 2) the obligation to absorb losses of
the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Update No.&nbsp;2009-17 eliminated the
quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE and
requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary. We adopted
Update No.&nbsp;2009-17 for our first quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2010. Based on our assessments under the
applicable guidance, we did not consolidate any VIEs during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010,
2009, or 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We account for investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant
influence under the equity method if we hold 50&nbsp;percent or less of the voting stock and the entity
is not a VIE in which we are the primary beneficiary. We record these investments initially at
cost, and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of the earnings or losses of the
investee, including all adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated financial
statements. We account for investments in entities in which we have less than a 20&nbsp;percent
ownership interest under the cost method of accounting if we do not have the ability to exercise
significant influence over the investee.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In the first quarter of 2008, we completed the divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses. Our
operating results for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 include the results of these businesses
through the date of separation, as these divestitures did not meet the criteria for discontinued
operations. On January&nbsp;3, 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker
Corporation. We are providing transitional services to Stryker through a transition services
agreement, and will also supply products to Stryker. These transition services and supply
agreements are expected to be effective for a period of up to 24&nbsp;months, subject to extension. Due
to our continuing involvement in the operations of the Neurovascular business, the divestiture does
not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation and, therefore, the results of
the Neurovascular business are included in our results of operations for all periods presented.
Refer to <I>Note C &#150; Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale </I>for a description of these business
divestitures.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes
estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported
amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ
from these estimates. Refer to <I>Critical Accounting Estimates </I>included in Item&nbsp;7 of this Annual
Report for further discussion.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Cash and Cash Equivalents</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We record cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets at cost, which approximates
fair value. Our policy is to invest excess cash in short-term marketable securities earning a
market rate of interest without assuming undue risk to principal, and we limit our direct exposure
to securities in any one industry or issuer. We consider all highly liquid investments purchased
with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash
equivalents.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We record available-for-sale investments at fair value and exclude unrealized gains and temporary
losses on available-for-sale securities from earnings, reporting such gains and losses, net of tax,
as a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity, until realized. We compute realized gains and
losses on sales of available-for-sale securities based on the average cost method, adjusted for any
other-than-temporary declines in fair value. We record held-to-maturity securities at amortized
cost and adjust for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts through maturity. We
classify investments in debt securities or equity securities that have a readily determinable fair
value that we purchase and hold principally for selling them in the near term as trading
securities. All of our cash investments as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 had maturity dates at date
of purchase of less than three months and, accordingly, we have classified them as cash and cash
equivalents in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Concentrations of Credit Risk</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instrument contracts and accounts and
notes receivable. Our investment policy limits exposure to concentrations of credit risk and
changes in market conditions. Counterparties to financial instruments expose us to credit-related
losses in the event of nonperformance. We transact our financial instruments with a diversified
group of major financial institutions and actively monitor outstanding positions to limit our
credit exposure.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We provide credit, in the normal course of business, to hospitals, healthcare agencies, clinics,
doctors&#146; offices and other private and governmental institutions and generally do not require
collateral. We perform on-going credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for
potential credit losses, based on historical information and management&#146;s best estimates. Amounts
determined to be uncollectible are written off against this reserve. We recorded write-offs of
uncollectible accounts receivable of $15&nbsp;million in 2010, $14&nbsp;million in 2009, and $11&nbsp;million in
2008. We are not dependent on any single institution and no single customer accounted for more than
ten percent of our net sales in 2010, 2009 or 2008. We closely monitor outstanding receivables for
potential collection risks, including those that may arise from economic conditions, in both the
U.S. and international economies. The credit and economic conditions within Greece, Italy, Spain,
Portugal and Ireland, among other members of the European Union, have deteriorated throughout 2010.

determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. We generally meet these criteria at the
time of shipment, unless a consignment arrangement exists or we are required to provide additional
services. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, or implant,
which indicates that the sale is complete. For our other transactions, we recognize revenue when
our products are delivered and risk of loss transfers to the customer, provided there are no
substantive remaining performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer
acceptance, and provided we can form an estimate for sales returns. Many of our Cardiac Rhythm
Management (CRM)&nbsp;product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE&#174; Patient
Management System, which represents a future service obligation. In accordance with accounting
guidance regarding multiple-element arrangements applicable through December&nbsp;31, 2010, we deferred
revenue on the undelivered service element based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value,
using the residual method of allocation, and recognized the associated revenue over the related
service period. On January&nbsp;1, 2011, we adopted ASC Update No.&nbsp;2009-13, <I>Revenue Recognition (Topic
605)- Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. </I>The consensus in Update No.&nbsp;2009-13 supersedes
certain guidance in Topic 605 (formerly EITF Issue No.&nbsp;00-21, <I>Multiple-Element Arrangements</I>).
Update No.&nbsp;2009-13 provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple
deliverables exist, how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the
revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables, including requiring the use of the
relative selling price method. The adoption of Update No.&nbsp;2009-13 did not have a material impact on
our results of operations or financial position.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired
products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the
amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow
customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these
transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based
upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are
shipped to the customer.

the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to estimate the expected rebates
reasonably, we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered. We have entered
certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating
hospitals at negotiated prices. We recognize revenue from these agreements following the same
revenue recognition criteria discussed above.

covering the replacement of these devices. We offer a full warranty for a portion of the period
post-implant, and a partial warranty over the remainder of the useful life of the product. We

excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A
significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted

assets and purchased research and development which either arise from a contractual or legal right

in a business combination, including purchased research and development, on detailed valuations
that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management&#146;s best
estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate any excess
purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired
to goodwill. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections;
growth rates; cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or
probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could
result in different purchase price allocations and amortization expense in current and future

we recognize a liability equal to the estimated discounted fair value of the contingent payments we
expect to make as of the acquisition date. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and
record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of

result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our purchased research and development represents intangible assets acquired in a business
combination that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached
technological feasibility, regardless of whether they have alternative future use. The primary
basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory
approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. Through December&nbsp;31,
2008, we expensed the value attributable to these in-process projects at the time of the
acquisition in accordance with accounting standards effective through that date. As discussed
above, as of January&nbsp;1, 2009, we adopted FASB Statement No.&nbsp;141(R), <I>Business Combinations </I>(codified
within ASC Topic 805, <I>Business Combinations</I>), a replacement for Statement No.&nbsp;141. Statement No.
141(R) also superseded FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;4, <I>Applicability of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;2 to Business
Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method</I>, which required research and development assets
acquired in a business combination that had no alternative future use to be measured at their fair
values and expensed at the acquisition date. Topic 805 requires that purchased research and
development acquired in a business combination be recognized as an indefinite-lived intangible
asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. For
our 2010 business combinations, we have recognized purchased research and development as an
intangible asset.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, we expense certain costs associated with strategic alliances outside of business
combinations as purchased research and development as of the acquisition date. Our adoption of
Statement No.&nbsp;141(R) (Topic 805) did not change this policy with respect to asset purchases.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development
at the date of acquisition. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash
flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life and then discounting these
after-tax cash flows back to a present value. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of
relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected
levels of market share. In arriving at the value of the in-process projects, we consider, among
other factors: the in-process projects&#146; stage of completion; the complexity of the work completed
as of the acquisition date; the costs already incurred; the projected costs to complete; the
contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets; the expected regulatory path and
introduction dates by region; and the estimated useful life of the technology. We apply a
market-participant risk-adjusted discount rate to arrive at a present value as of the date of
acquisition. We believe that the estimated in-process research and development amounts so
determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third
party would pay for the projects. However, if the projects are not successful or completed in a
timely manner, we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the
acquisition as a whole.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We test our purchased research and development intangible assets acquired in a business combination
for impairment at least annually, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the assets may be impaired. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair
value of the intangible assets with their carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair
value, we would record an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess. Upon completion of the
associated research and development efforts, we will determine the useful life of the technology
and begin amortizing the assets to reflect their use over their remaining lives; upon permanent
abandonment we would write-off the remaining carrying amount of the associated purchased research
and development intangible asset.

We use a straight-line method of amortization, unless a method that better reflects the pattern in
which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be
reliably determined. The approximate useful lives for amortization of our intangible assets is as
follows: patents and licenses, two to 20&nbsp;years; definite-lived core and developed technology, five
to 25&nbsp;years; customer relationships, five to 25&nbsp;years; other intangible assets, various.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse
conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a
change in the remaining useful life.
Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse
change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset, a product
recall, or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If an impairment indicator exists, we
test the intangible asset for recoverability. For purposes of the recoverability test, we group
our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of
identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other
assets and liabilities. If the carrying value of the intangible asset (asset group) exceeds the
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible
asset (asset group), we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period
identified.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future
cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. In determining
our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and
assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the
asset (asset group). The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount
rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of
impairment. However, we believe our assumptions and estimates are accurate and represent our best
estimates. See <I>Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets </I>for more information related to
impairments of intangible assets during 2010, 2009, and 2008.

attorney fees, registration fees, consulting fees, and other expenditures directly related to

internally-developed patents and those obtained through our acquisitions are capitalized and
amortized over the remaining amortizable life of the related patent.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable
intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our April 1 goodwill
balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators
are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the
assessment, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under ASC Topic 350, <I>Intangibles-Goodwill
and Other </I>(formerly FASB Statement No.&nbsp;142, <I>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets). </I>The first step
requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as defined, to the fair value
of these units. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as
an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We
determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments, and then assess whether
any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is
available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component.
We aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. For
our April&nbsp;1, 2010 annual impairment assessment, we identified our reporting units to be our seven
U.S. operating segments, which in aggregate make up the U.S. reportable segment, and our four
international operating segments. When allocating goodwill from business combinations to our
reporting units, we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the
respective business combination at the time of acquisition. In addition, for purposes of performing
our annual goodwill impairment test, assets and liabilities, including corporate assets, which
relate to a reporting unit&#146;s operations, and would be considered in determining its fair value, are
allocated to the individual reporting units. We allocate assets and liabilities not directly
related to a specific reporting unit, but from which the reporting unit benefits, based primarily
on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we used only the income approach, specifically the discounted cash
flow (DCF)&nbsp;method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our
goodwill impairment assessment. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax
cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a
present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most
meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most
appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach
and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given

lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the
inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units
for application of the cost approach.
Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique
for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the
amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate
discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our
most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value
growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our
DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units.
We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average costs of capital (WACC)&nbsp;as a
basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units&#146; future expected cash
flows.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step
of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step
of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit&#146;s goodwill to
its carrying value. If we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance
of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated,
we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and
disclose that the amount is an estimate. We would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in
subsequent reporting periods, once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test.

significant doubt about an investee&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. If we identify an
impairment indicator, we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its
carrying value. Our estimation of fair value considers all available financial information related
to the investee, including valuations based on recent third-party equity investments in the
investee. If the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value, the investment is
impaired and we make a determination as to whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. We deem
impairment to be other-than-temporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold an investment
for a period sufficient for a market recovery up to the carrying value of the investment. Further,
evidence must indicate that the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable
period. For other-than-temporary impairments, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the
difference between an investment&#146;s carrying value and its fair value. Impairment losses on our
investments are included in other, net in our consolidated statements of operations.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we
determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting
and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using
the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse. We
reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available
evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a
valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of
operations for the current and preceding years, the availability of deferred tax liabilities and
tax carrybacks, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We do not provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we have
indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations. It is not practical to estimate
the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign
operations. Unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we have indefinitely reinvested in
foreign operations are $9.193&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and $9.355&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31,
2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of
conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and
calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our
worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes
for all years subject to audit. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the final outcome
of open tax matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax
provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision
and operating results.

seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or
impact our ability to sell our products. We are also the subject of certain governmental
investigations, which could result in substantial fines, penalties, and administrative remedies. We
are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability and intellectual property
infringement claims. We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities
claims. We generally record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in
earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable. In accordance with ASC
Topic 450, <I>Contingencies </I>(formerly FASB Statement No.&nbsp;5, <I>Accounting for Contingencies), </I>we accrue
anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for general product liability claims and, under
certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific
losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate
of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum
amount of the range. We analyze litigation settlements to identify each element of the arrangement.
We allocate arrangement consideration to patent licenses received based on estimates of fair value,
and capitalize these amounts as assets if the license will provide an on-going future benefit. See

those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the hedging
instrument must be designated, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash
flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. The accounting for changes in
the fair value (i.e. gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been
designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging
relationship. Our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings or cash flows to material
risk, as gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the item being
hedged. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and we do not have

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the $200&nbsp;million of
potential payments was estimated by discounting, to present value, the contingent payments expected
to be made based on our estimates of the revenues expected to result from the acquisition. We used
a risk-adjusted discount rate of 20&nbsp;percent to
reflect the market risks of commercializing this technology, which we believe is appropriate and
representative of market participant assumptions. For the $50&nbsp;million milestone payment, we used a
probability-weighted scenario approach to determine the fair value of this obligation using
internal revenue projections and external market factors. We applied a rate of probability to each
scenario, as well as a risk-adjusted discount factor, to derive the estimated fair value of the
contingent consideration as of the acquisition date. This fair value measurement is based on
significant unobservable inputs, including management estimates and assumptions and, accordingly,
is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy prescribed by ASC Topic 820, <I>Fair Value

fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases
or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in
discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates.
During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded expense of $2&nbsp;million in the accompanying statements
of operations representing the increase in fair value of this obligation between the acquisition
date and December&nbsp;31, 2010.

understanding with respect to products and processes that we will leverage in future products or
processes and will carry forward from one product generation to the next. Developed technology
represents the value associated with marketed products that have received regulatory approval,
primarily the Alair<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> Bronchial Thermoplasty System acquired from Asthmatx, which is
approved for distribution in CE Mark countries and received FDA approval in April&nbsp;2010. The
amortizable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their assigned
useful lives.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value of acquired in-process
research and development projects, including the second generation of the Alair<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>
product, which have not yet reached technological feasibility. The indefinite-lived intangible
assets will be tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment
indicators are present, in accordance with our accounting policies described in <I>Note A- Significant
Accounting Policies</I>, and amortization of the purchased research and development will begin upon
completion of the project. As of the acquisition date, we estimate that the total cost to complete
the in-process research and development programs acquired from Asthmatx is between $10&nbsp;million and
$15&nbsp;million. We currently expect to launch the second generation of the Alair<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> product
in the U.S. in 2014, in our Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA)&nbsp;region and certain Inter-Continental
countries in 2016, and Japan in 2017, subject to regulatory approvals. We expect material net cash
inflows from such products to commence in 2014, following the launch of this technology in the U.S.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We believe that the estimated intangible asset values so determined represent the fair value at the
date of each acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the assets. We
used the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method, to derive the fair value of
the amortizable intangible assets and purchased research and development. These fair value
measurements are based on significant unobservable inputs, including management estimates and
assumptions and, accordingly, are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy prescribed
by Topic 820.

accordance with this policy, we recorded purchased research and development charges of $21&nbsp;million

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Certain of our acquisitions involve contingent consideration arrangements. Payment of additional
consideration is generally contingent on the acquired company reaching certain performance
milestones, including attaining specified revenue levels, achieving product development targets or
obtaining regulatory approvals. In August&nbsp;2007, we entered an agreement to amend our 2004 merger
agreement with the principal former shareholders of Advanced Bionics Corporation. Previously, we
were obligated to pay future consideration contingent primarily on the achievement of future
performance milestones. The amended agreement provided a new schedule of consolidated, fixed
payments, consisting of $650&nbsp;million that was paid in 2008, and a final $500&nbsp;million payment, paid
in 2009. We received cash proceeds of $150&nbsp;million in 2008 related to our sale of a controlling
interest in the Auditory business acquired with Advanced Bionics, and received additional proceeds
of $40&nbsp;million in 2009 related to the sale of our remaining interest in this business. Refer to
<I>Note C &#150; Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale </I>for a discussion of this transaction. During 2010,
we made total payments of $12&nbsp;million related to prior period acquisitions. During 2009, including
the $500&nbsp;million payment to the former shareholders of Advanced Bionics, we made total payments of
$523&nbsp;million related to prior period acquisitions. During 2008, we paid $675&nbsp;million related to
prior period acquisitions, consisting primarily of the $650&nbsp;million payment made to the principal
former shareholders of Advanced Bionics.

combinations, we recorded liabilities of $69&nbsp;million representing the estimated fair value of

million attributable to other acquisitions. The maximum amount of future contingent consideration

for a purchase price of $1.5&nbsp;billion, payable in cash. We received $1.450&nbsp;billion at closing,
including an upfront payment of $1.426&nbsp;billion, and $24&nbsp;million which was placed into escrow to be
released upon the completion of local closings in certain foreign jurisdictions, and will receive
$50&nbsp;million contingent upon the transfer or
separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which we expect will be completed over a period of
approximately 24&nbsp;months. We are providing transitional services to Stryker through a transition
services agreement, and will also supply products to Stryker. These transition services and supply
agreements are expected to be effective for a period of up to 24&nbsp;months, subject to extension. Due
to our continuing involvement in the operations of the Neurovascular business, the divestiture does
not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation. We acquired the Neurovascular

with the principal former shareholders of Advanced Bionics for an aggregate purchase price of $150
million in cash. Under the terms of the agreement, we retained an equity interest in the limited
liability company formed for purposes of operating the Auditory business and, in 2009, received
proceeds of $40&nbsp;million from the subsequent sale of this investment. In addition, we sold our
Cardiac Surgery and Vascular Surgery businesses to the Getinge Group for net cash proceeds of
approximately $700&nbsp;million. We acquired the Cardiac Surgery business in April&nbsp;2006 with our
acquisition of Guidant Corporation and acquired the Vascular Surgery business in 1995. Further, we
sold our Fluid Management and Venous Access businesses to Navilyst Medical (affiliated with Avista
Capital Partners) for net cash proceeds of approximately $400&nbsp;million, and recorded a gain of $234
million during 2008 associated with the transaction. We acquired the Fluid Management business as

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We test our April 1 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or
more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may
exist. The ship hold and product removal actions associated with our U.S. implantable cardioverter
defibrillator (ICD)&nbsp;and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) products, which we
announced on March&nbsp;15, 2010, described in Item&nbsp;7 of this Annual Report, and the expected
corresponding financial impact on our operations created an indication of potential impairment of
the goodwill balance attributable to our U.S. Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM)&nbsp;reporting unit.
Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with our accounting policies
described in <I>Note A </I>&#150; <I>Significant Accounting Policies</I>, and recorded a $1.848&nbsp;billion, on both a
pre-tax and after-tax basis, goodwill impairment charge associated with our U.S. CRM reporting
unit. Due to the timing of the product actions and the procedures required to complete the two step
goodwill impairment test, the goodwill impairment charge was an estimate, which we finalized in the
second quarter of 2010. During the second quarter of 2010, we recorded a $31&nbsp;million reduction of
the charge, resulting in a final goodwill impairment charge of $1.817&nbsp;billion. This charge does not
impact our compliance with our debt covenants or our cash flows.

<!-- xbrl -->


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At the time we performed our interim goodwill impairment test, we estimated that our U.S.
defibrillator market share would decrease approximately 400 basis points exiting 2010 as a result
of the ship hold and product removal actions, as compared to our market share exiting 2009, and
that these actions would negatively impact our 2010 U.S. CRM revenues by approximately $300
million. In addition, we expected that our on-going U.S. CRM net sales and profitability would
likely continue to be adversely impacted as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions.
Therefore, as a result of these product actions, as well as lower expectations of market growth in
new areas and increased competitive and other pricing pressures, we lowered our estimated average
U.S. CRM net sales growth rates within our 15-year discounted cash flow (DCF)&nbsp;model, as well as our
terminal value growth rate, by approximately a couple of hundred basis points to derive the fair
value of the U.S. CRM reporting unit. The reduction in our forecasted 2010 U.S. CRM net sales, the
change in our expected sales growth rates thereafter and the reduction in profitability as a result
of the recently enacted excise tax on medical device manufacturers, discussed in Item&nbsp;7 of this
Annual Report, were several key factors contributing to the impairment charge. Partially offsetting
these factors was a 50 basis point reduction in our estimated market-participant risk-adjusted
weighted-average cost of capital (WACC)&nbsp;used in determining our discount rate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In the second quarter of 2010, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our
reporting units. We updated our U.S. CRM assumptions to reflect our market share position at that
time, our most recent operational budgets and long range strategic plans. In conjunction with our
annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, with the exception
of our U.S. CRM reporting unit. Based on the remaining book value of our U.S. CRM reporting unit
following the goodwill impairment charge, the carrying value of our U.S. CRM reporting unit
continues to exceed its fair value, due primarily to the book value of amortizable intangible
assets allocated to this reporting unit. The remaining book value of our amortizable intangible
assets which have been allocated to our U.S. CRM reporting unit is approximately $3.5&nbsp;billion as of
December&nbsp;31, 2010. We tested these amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an undiscounted
cash flow
basis as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, and determined that these assets were not impaired, and there have been
no impairment indicators related to these assets subsequent to the performance of that test. The
assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test related to our U.S. CRM reporting unit were
substantially consistent with those used in our first quarter interim impairment test.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In the fourth quarter of 2010, we performed an interim impairment test on our international
reporting units as a result of the announced divestiture of our Neurovascular business, discussed
in <I>Note C &#150; Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale</I>. As part of the divestment, we allocated a
portion of our goodwill from our international reporting units to the Neurovascular business being
sold. We then tested each of our international reporting units for impairment in accordance with
ASC Topic 350, <I>Intangibles &#150; Goodwill and Other</I>. Our testing did not identify any reporting units
whose carrying values exceeded the calculated fair values. However, the level of excess fair value
over carrying value for our EMEA region is approximately six percent, a decrease from 14&nbsp;percent in
the second quarter.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Goodwill Impairment Monitoring</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have identified a total of four reporting units with a material amount of goodwill that are at
higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the impairment test in future reporting
periods. These reporting units include our U.S. CRM unit, which holds $1.5&nbsp;billion of allocated
goodwill, our U.S. Cardiovascular unit, which holds $2.2&nbsp;billion of allocated goodwill, our U.S.
Neuromodulation unit, which holds $1.2&nbsp;billion of allocated goodwill, and our EMEA region, which
holds $3.9&nbsp;billion of allocated goodwill. The level of excess fair value over carrying value for
these reporting units identified as being at higher risk (with the exception of the U.S. CRM
reporting unit, whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value) ranged from approximately
six percent to 23&nbsp;percent. On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these
reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test.
The key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth
rates, levels of profitability and perpetual growth rate assumptions, as well as the WACC. These
assumptions are subject to uncertainty, including our ability to grow revenue and improve
profitability levels. For each of these reporting units, relatively small declines in the future
performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or small changes in other key assumptions may
result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges. For example, keeping all
other variables constant, a 50 basis point increase in the WACC applied would require that we

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During the fourth quarter of 2008, the decline in our stock price and our market capitalization
created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance. Therefore, we performed an
interim impairment test and recorded a $2.613&nbsp;billion goodwill impairment charge associated with
our U.S. CRM reporting unit. As a result of economic conditions and the related increase in
volatility in the equity and credit markets, which became more pronounced starting in the fourth
quarter of 2008, our estimated risk-adjusted WACC increased 150 basis points from 9.5&nbsp;percent
during our 2008 second quarter annual goodwill impairment assessment to 11.0&nbsp;percent during our
2008 fourth quarter interim impairment assessment. This change, along with reductions in market
demand for products in our U.S. CRM reporting unit relative to our assumptions at the time of the
Guidant acquisition, were the key factors contributing to the impairment charge. At the time we
acquired the CRM business from Guidant Corporation in 2006, we expected average U.S. CRM net sales
growth rates in the mid-teens; however, due to changes in end market demand, we reduced our
estimates of average U.S. CRM sales growth rates to the mid-to-high single digits. Our estimated
risk-adjusted market-participant WACC decreased 50 basis points from 11.0&nbsp;percent during our 2008
fourth quarter interim impairment assessment to 10.5&nbsp;percent

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Other Intangible Asset Impairment Charges</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During 2010, due to lower than anticipated net sales of one of our Peripheral Interventions
technology offerings, as well as changes in our expectations of future market acceptance of this
technology, we lowered our sales forecasts associated with the product. In addition, as part of our
initiatives to reprioritize and diversify our product portfolio, we discontinued one of our
internal research and development programs to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success.
As a result of these factors, and in accordance with our accounting policies described in <I>Note A</I>,
we tested the related intangible assets for impairment and recorded intangible asset impairment
charges of $65&nbsp;million to write down the balance of these intangible assets to their fair values.
We have recorded these amounts in the intangible asset impairment charges caption in our
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During 2009, we recorded $12&nbsp;million of intangible asset impairment charges to write down the value
of certain intangible assets to their fair value, due primarily to lower than anticipated market
penetration of one of our Urology technology offerings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During 2008, we reduced our future revenue and cash flow forecasts associated with certain of our
Peripheral Interventions-related intangible assets, primarily as a result of a recall of one of our
products. Therefore, we tested these intangible assets for impairment, and determined that these
assets were impaired, resulting in a $131
million charge to write down these intangible assets to their fair value. Further, as a result of
significantly lower than forecasted sales of certain of our Urology products, due to lower than
anticipated market penetration, we determined that certain of our Urology-related intangible assets
were impaired, resulting in a $46&nbsp;million impairment charge to write down these intangible assets
to their fair value.

instrument must be designated, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash

designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging
relationship. Our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings or cash flows to material
risk, as gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the item being
hedged. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and we do not have

derivative instruments (currency forward and option contracts), and non-derivative transactions
(primarily European manufacturing and distribution operations) to reduce the risk that our earnings
and cash flows associated with these foreign currency denominated balances and transactions will be
adversely affected by currency exchange rate changes.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Designated Foreign Currency Hedges</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">All of our designated currency hedge contracts outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and December&nbsp;31,
2009 were cash flow hedges under Topic 815 intended to protect the U.S. dollar value of our
forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions. We record the effective portion of any change
in the fair value of foreign currency cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income (OCI)&nbsp;until
the related third-party transaction occurs. Once the related third-party transaction occurs, we
reclassify the effective portion of any related gain or loss on the foreign
currency cash flow hedge to earnings. In the event the hedged forecasted transaction does not
occur, or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur, we reclassify the amount of any gain or
loss on the related cash flow hedge to earnings at that time. We had currency derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding in the contract amount of $2.679&nbsp;billion as
of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and $2.760&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We recognized net losses of $30&nbsp;million in earnings on our cash flow hedges during 2010, as
compared to net gains of $4&nbsp;million during 2009 and net losses of $67&nbsp;million during 2008. All
currency cash flow hedges outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 mature within 36&nbsp;months. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2010, $71&nbsp;million of net losses, net of tax, were recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income (AOCI)&nbsp;to recognize the effective portion of the fair value of any currency
derivative instruments that are, or previously were, designated as foreign currency cash flow
hedges, as compared to net losses of $44&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010,
$47&nbsp;million of net losses, net of tax, may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve
months.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The success of our hedging program depends, in part, on forecasts of transaction activity in
various currencies (primarily Japanese yen, Euro, British pound sterling, Australian dollar and
Canadian dollar). We may experience unanticipated currency exchange gains or losses to the extent
that there are differences between forecasted and actual activity during periods of currency
volatility. In addition, changes in currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions
may impact our earnings and cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During 2009, we directed our EMEA sales offices to converge differing operating structures to a
consistent limited risk distribution sales structure beginning in the third quarter of 2010. This
change impacted our EMEA transaction flow and effectively moved our foreign exchange risk from
third-party sales to intercompany sales. While the convergence has not had a significant impact on
the magnitude of foreign currency exposure, we de-designated certain cash flow hedges of
third-party sales. We reclassified net losses of $5&nbsp;million from AOCI to current earnings during
2009 related to these de-designated cash flow hedges.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Non-designated Foreign Currency Contracts</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We use currency forward contracts as a part of our strategy to manage exposure related to foreign
currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. These currency forward contracts are not
designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges under Topic 815; are marked-to-market
with changes in fair value recorded to earnings; and are entered into for periods consistent with
currency transaction exposures, generally one to six months. We had currency derivative instruments
not designated as hedges under Topic 815 outstanding in the contract amount of $2.398&nbsp;billion as of
December&nbsp;31, 2010 and $1.982&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U>Interest Rate Hedging</U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings, partially offset by U.S. dollar
cash investments. We use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow
exposure to changes in interest rates by converting floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt or
fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We designate these derivative instruments either as fair value or cash flow hedges under Topic 815.
We record changes in the value of fair value hedges in interest expense, which is generally offset
by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligation. Interest payments made or received
related to our interest rate derivative instruments are included in interest expense. We record the
effective portion of any change in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow
hedges as unrealized gains or losses in OCI, net of tax, until the hedged cash flow occurs, at
which point the effective portion of any gain or loss is reclassified to earnings. We record the
ineffective portion of our cash flow hedges in interest expense. In the event the hedged cash flow
does not occur, or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur, we reclassify the amount of
any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge to interest expense at that time. During 2009, our
interest rate derivative instruments either matured as scheduled or were terminated in connection
with the prepayment of our bank term loan, discussed further in <I>Note G &#150; Borrowings and Credit
Arrangements</I>. We recognized $27&nbsp;million of losses within interest expense during 2009 due to the
early termination of these interest rate contracts. We had no interest rate derivative instruments
outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 or December&nbsp;31, 2009. In the first quarter of 2011, we
entered interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of $850&nbsp;million to convert
fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt, which we have designated as fair value hedges.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In prior years we terminated certain interest rate derivative instruments, including
fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts, designated as fair value hedges, and floating-to-fixed
treasury locks, designated as cash flow hedges. In accordance with Topic 815, we are amortizing the
gains and losses of these derivative instruments upon termination into earnings over the term of
the hedged debt. The carrying amount of certain of our senior notes included unamortized gains of
$2&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and $3&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, and unamortized losses
of $5&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and $8&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, related to the
fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts. We recognized approximately $2&nbsp;million of interest
expense during 2010 and 2009 related to these derivative instruments. In addition, we had pre-tax
net gains within AOCI related to terminated floating-to-fixed treasury locks of $8&nbsp;million as of
December&nbsp;31, 2010 and $11&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. We recognized approximately $3&nbsp;million
as a reduction of interest expense during 2010 and $2&nbsp;million as a reduction in interest expense
related to these derivative instruments during 2009. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, $5&nbsp;million of net
gains, net of tax, are recorded in AOCI to recognize the effective portion of these instruments, as
compared to $7&nbsp;million of net gains as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, an immaterial
amount of net gains, net of tax, may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months from
amortization of our previously terminated interest rate derivative instruments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During 2010, we recognized in earnings an immaterial amount of net gains related to our previously
terminated interest rate derivative contracts. During 2009, we recognized in earnings $70&nbsp;million
of net losses, inclusive of the $27&nbsp;million of interest rate contract termination losses described
above, related to our interest rate derivative instruments, including previously terminated
interest rate derivative contracts. During 2008, we recognized in earnings $20&nbsp;million of net
losses related to our interest rate contracts.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We do not have significant concentrations of credit risk arising from our derivative financial
instruments, whether from an individual counterparty or a related group of counterparties. We
manage our concentration of counterparty credit risk on our derivative instruments by limiting
acceptable counterparties to a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment
grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of credit exposure to each counterparty, and by actively
monitoring their credit ratings and outstanding fair values on an on-going basis. Furthermore, none
of our derivative transactions are subject to collateral or other security arrangements and none
contain provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agency.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We also employ master netting arrangements that reduce our counterparty payment settlement risk on
any given maturity date to the net amount of any receipts or payments due between us and the
counterparty financial institution. Thus, the maximum loss due to credit risk by counterparty is
limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts net of any unrealized losses should any of these
counterparties fail to perform as contracted. Although these protections do not eliminate
concentrations of credit, as a result of the above considerations, we do not consider the risk of
counterparty default to be significant.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Topic 815 requires all derivative instruments to be recognized at their fair values as either
assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. We determine the fair value of our derivative
instruments using the framework prescribed by ASC Topic 820, <I>Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures </I>(formerly FASB Statement No.&nbsp;157, <I>Fair Value Measurements</I>), by considering the
estimated amount we would receive to sell or transfer these instruments at the reporting date and
by taking into account current interest rates, currency exchange rates, the creditworthiness of the
counterparty for assets, and our creditworthiness for liabilities. In certain instances, we may
utilize financial models to measure fair value. Generally, we use inputs that include quoted prices
for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets
or liabilities in markets that are not active; other observable inputs for the asset or liability;
and inputs derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or
other means. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we have classified all of our derivative assets and
liabilities within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy prescribed by Topic 820, as discussed below,
because these observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of our derivative
instruments.

based upon quoted market prices, where available. Where quoted market prices or other observable

categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is
based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. The

periods subsequent to initial recognition. The fair value of a cost method investment is not

adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. The aggregate carrying amount of our cost
method investments was $43&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and $58&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.

intangible assets to their fair values, and $16&nbsp;million of losses to write down certain cost method
investments to their fair values, because we deemed the decline in the values of the investments to
be other-than-temporary. We wrote down goodwill attributable to our U.S. CRM reporting unit,
discussed in <I>Note D &#150; Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, </I>with a carrying amount of $3.296
billion to its estimated fair value of $1.479&nbsp;billion, resulting in a write-down of $1.817&nbsp;billion.
In addition, we recorded a loss of $60&nbsp;million to write down certain of our Peripheral
Interventions intangible assets, discussed in <I>Note D, </I>to their estimated fair values of $14
million; and a loss of $5&nbsp;million, discussed in <I>Note D, </I>to write off the remaining value associated
with certain other intangible assets. These adjustments fall within Level 3 of the fair value

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our term loan facility requires quarterly principal payments of $50&nbsp;million commencing in the third
quarter of 2011, with the remaining principal amount due at the credit facility maturity date,
currently June&nbsp;2013, with up to two one-year extension options subject to certain conditions.
However, in January&nbsp;2011, we prepaid $250&nbsp;million of these obligations using borrowings from our
credit and security facility discussed below, and, accordingly, have presented the full prepayment
within 2011 above, as well as within &#145;current debt obligations&#146; in our accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. As a result, quarterly principal payments of $50&nbsp;million will commence in the
fourth quarter of 2012. Term loan borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin of
between 1.75&nbsp;percent and 3.25&nbsp;percent, based on our corporate credit ratings (currently 2.75
percent).
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In the second quarter of 2010, we syndicated a new $2.0&nbsp;billion revolving credit facility, maturing
in June&nbsp;2013, with up to two one-year extension options subject to certain conditions, to replace
our existing $1.75&nbsp;billion revolving credit facility maturing in April&nbsp;2011. Any revolving credit
facility borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin of between 1.55&nbsp;percent and
2.625&nbsp;percent, based on our corporate credit ratings (currently 2.25&nbsp;percent). In addition, we are
required to pay a facility fee based on our credit ratings and the total amount of revolving credit
commitments, regardless of usage, under the agreement (currently 0.50&nbsp;percent per year). Any
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are unrestricted and unsecured. There were no
amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 or December&nbsp;31,
2009.

a $745&nbsp;million letter of credit under our credit facility as collateral for the remaining Johnson &#038;
Johnson obligation. In August&nbsp;2010, we prepaid the remaining Johnson &#038; Johnson obligation of $725
million, plus interest, using cash on hand and cancelled the related letter of credit. We now have
full access to our $2.0&nbsp;billion revolving credit facility to support operational needs. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had outstanding letters of credit of $120&nbsp;million, as compared to $123&nbsp;million as of
December&nbsp;31, 2009, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers&#146;
compensation insurance arrangements. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, none of the beneficiaries
had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees; accordingly, we have not recognized a related
liability for our outstanding letters of credit in our consolidated balance sheets as of December
31, 2010 or 2009. We believe we will generate sufficient cash from operations to fund these
payments and intend to fund these payments without drawing on the letters of credit.

could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders
would grant such waivers.

payable semi-annually. We determined that an appropriate fair market interest rate on the loan from
Abbott was 5.25&nbsp;percent per annum. We recorded the loan at a discount of approximately $50&nbsp;million

of the loan. Upon repayment of the loan, we accelerated the recognition of the remaining
unamortized discount of $10&nbsp;million through interest expense. There was no remaining unamortized

with our senior notes. Our $2.0&nbsp;billion of senior notes issued in 2009 contain a change-in-control
provision, which provides that each holder of the senior notes may require us to repurchase all or
a portion of the notes at a price equal to 101&nbsp;percent of the aggregate repurchased principal, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if a rating event, as defined in the indenture, occurs as a result of
a change-in-control, as defined in the indenture. Any other credit rating changes may impact our
borrowing cost, but do not require us to repay any borrowings. Subsequent rating improvements may
result in a decrease in the adjusted interest rate to the extent that our lowest credit rating is
above BBB- or Baa3. The interest rates on our November&nbsp;2015 and November&nbsp;2035 Notes will be
permanently reinstated to the issuance rate if the lowest credit ratings assigned to these senior
notes is either A- or A3 or higher.

maturing in August&nbsp;2011, subject to extension. Use of any borrowed funds is unrestricted. Borrowing
availability under this facility changes based upon the amount of eligible receivables,
concentration of eligible receivables and other factors. Certain significant changes in the quality
of our receivables may require us to repay borrowings immediately under the facility. The credit
agreement required us to create a wholly-owned entity, which we consolidate. This entity purchases
our U.S. trade accounts receivable and then borrows from two third-party financial institutions
using these receivables as collateral. The receivables and related borrowings remain on our
consolidated balance sheets because we have the right to prepay any borrowings and effectively
retain control over the receivables. Accordingly, pledged receivables are included as trade
accounts receivable, net, while the corresponding borrowings are included as debt on our
consolidated balance sheets. There were no amounts borrowed under this facility as of December&nbsp;31,
2010 or 2009. In January&nbsp;2011, we borrowed $250&nbsp;million under this facility and used the proceeds
to prepay $100&nbsp;million of term loan borrowings maturing in 2011 and $150&nbsp;million of term loan
borrowings maturing in 2012.

the accounts are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. We

</DIV>
<!-- xbrl,body -->

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On an on-going basis, we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the
markets in which we compete; and we continue to assess opportunities for improved operational
effectiveness and efficiency, and better alignment of expenses with revenues, while preserving our
ability to make the investments in research and development projects, capital and our people that
are essential to our long-term success. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken
various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for
long-term success. These initiatives are described below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In October&nbsp;2007, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expense and head count
reduction plan (the 2007 Restructuring plan). The plan was intended to bring expenses in line with
revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short- and long-term shareholder value. Key
activities under the plan included the restructuring of several businesses, corporate functions and
product franchises in order to better utilize resources, strengthen competitive positions, and
create a more simplified and efficient business model; the elimination, suspension or reduction of
spending on certain research and development projects; and the transfer of certain production lines
among facilities. We initiated these activities in the fourth quarter of 2007. The transfer of
certain production lines contemplated under the 2007 Restructuring plan was completed as of
December&nbsp;31, 2010; all other major activities under the plan,
with the exception of final production line transfers, were completed as of December&nbsp;31,
2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The execution of this plan resulted in total pre-tax expenses of $427&nbsp;million and required cash
outlays of $380&nbsp;million, of which we have paid $370&nbsp;million to date. We recorded a portion of these
expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our
consolidated statements of operations.

Network Optimization program, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by
transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities. The
program is a complement to our 2007 Restructuring plan, and is intended to improve overall gross
profit margins. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the first

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Termination benefits represent amounts incurred pursuant to our on-going benefit arrangements and
amounts for one-time involuntary termination benefits, and have been recorded in accordance with
ASC Topic 712, <I>Compensation &#150; Non-retirement Postemployment Benefits </I>(formerly FASB Statement No.
112, <I>Employer&#146;s Accounting for Postemployment Benefits</I>) and ASC Topic 420, <I>Exit or Disposal Cost
Obligations </I>(formerly FASB Statement 146, <I>Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities</I>). We expect to record additional termination benefits related to our Plant Network
Optimization program and 2010 Restructuring plan in 2011 and 2012 when we identify with more
specificity the job classifications, functions and locations of the remaining head count to be
eliminated. Retention incentives represent cash incentives, which were recorded over the service
period during which eligible employees remained employed with us in order to retain the payment.
Other restructuring costs, which represent primarily consulting fees, are being recorded as
incurred in accordance with Topic 420. Accelerated depreciation is being recorded over the adjusted
remaining useful life of the related assets, and production line transfer costs are being recorded
as incurred.

of December&nbsp;31, 2009. Gross deferred tax liabilities of $2.281&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and
$2.382&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 relate primarily to intangible assets acquired in connection
with our prior acquisitions. Gross deferred tax assets of $1.083&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2010
and $1.101&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 relate primarily to the establishment of inventory and
product-related reserves, litigation and product liability reserves, purchased research and
development, investment write-downs, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.
In light of our historical financial performance and the extent of our deferred tax liabilities, we
believe we will recover substantially all of these assets.

jurisdictions. We have concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters through 2000 and substantially
all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters through 2001. We resolved a number of
foreign examinations during 2010. As a result of these activities, we decreased our reserve for
uncertain tax positions by $9&nbsp;million, inclusive of $3&nbsp;million of interest and penalties. In
addition, as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations in various foreign and state
jurisdictions, we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by $20&nbsp;million, inclusive of $7
million of interest and penalties. Further, during 2010, we concluded the appeals process for the federal tax
examination for Boston Scientific (excluding Guidant) covering years
2002-2005 and decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions
by $72&nbsp;million, inclusive of $21&nbsp;million of interest and penalties, net of payments. We also
re-measured an uncertain tax position due to a favorable court ruling issued in a similar
third-party case and resolved another uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable taxpayer
motion issued in a similar third-party case, which resulted in a decrease of $91&nbsp;million inclusive
of $25&nbsp;million of interest and penalties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During 2009, we received favorable foreign court decisions and resolved certain foreign matters. As
a result of these activities, we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by $20&nbsp;million,
inclusive of $7&nbsp;million of interest and penalties. In addition, statutes of limitations expired in
various foreign and state jurisdictions, as a result, decreased our reserve for uncertain tax
positions by $29&nbsp;million, inclusive of interest and penalties. We also resolved certain
litigation-related matters, described our 2009 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. Based on the
outcome of the settlements, we reassessed the reserve for uncertain tax positions previously
recorded on certain positions and decreased our reserve by $22&nbsp;million, inclusive of $1&nbsp;million of
interest.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During 2008, we resolved certain matters in federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions for Guidant
and Boston Scientific for the years 1998- 2005. We settled multiple federal issues at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
examination and Appellate levels, including issues related to Guidant&#146;s acquisition of Intermedics,
Inc., and various litigation settlements. We also received favorable foreign court decisions and a
favorable outcome related to our foreign research credit claims. As a result of these audit
activities, we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions, excluding tax payments, by $156
million, inclusive of $37&nbsp;million of interest and penalties during 2008.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On December&nbsp;17, 2010, we received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS
reflecting proposed audit adjustments for Guidant Corporation for the 2001-2003 tax years. The
incremental tax liability asserted by the IRS is $525&nbsp;million plus interest. The primary issue in
dispute is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between
domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant. We believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax
filing and we intend to file a petition to the U.S. Tax Court in early 2011. No payments will be
made on the issue until it is resolved, which may take several years. We believe that our income
tax reserves associated with this matter are adequate and the final resolution will not have a
material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. However, final resolution is
uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense.
We had $285&nbsp;million accrued for gross interest and penalties as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and $299
million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. The decrease in gross interest and penalties was the result of a
$72&nbsp;million reduction, due primarily to the conclusion of the appeals process for the federal tax
examination covering years 2002-2005, payments related to audit settlements, re-measurement and
resolution of uncertain tax positions due to favorable court rulings and favorable taxpayer motion
issued in similar third-party cases, and statute expirations, offset by $58&nbsp;million recognized in
our consolidated statements of operations. We released $14&nbsp;million of total interest and penalties
related to income taxes in 2010, and recognized $31&nbsp;million in 2009 and $4&nbsp;million in 2008.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">It is reasonably possible that within the next 12&nbsp;months we will resolve multiple issues including
transfer pricing, research and development credit and transactional related issues, with foreign,
federal and state taxing authorities, in which case we could record a reduction in our balance of
unrecognized tax benefits of up to approximately $14&nbsp;million.

product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties.
In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related
proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently
drive settlement not only for individual cases, but also for a series of pending and potentially
related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically
sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial
court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are
difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in
other geographies. Several third parties have asserted that certain of our current and former
product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them. We have similarly asserted that other
products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us. Adverse outcomes in one
or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain
jurisdictions, or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

found the two patents unenforceable for inequitable conduct. Cordis appealed the non-infringement

approximately 37 individual plaintiffs remain pending in various state and federal jurisdictions
against Guidant alleging personal injuries associated with defibrillators or pacemakers involved in
certain 2005 and 2006 product communications. The majority of the cases in the United States are
pending in federal court but approximately seven cases are currently pending in state courts. On
November&nbsp;7, 2005, the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation established MDL-1708 (MDL)&nbsp;in the
U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota and appointed a single judge to preside over all
the cases in the MDL. In April&nbsp;2006, the personal injury plaintiffs and certain third-party payors
served a Master Complaint in the MDL asserting claims for class action certification, alleging
claims of strict liability, negligence, fraud, breach of warranty and other common law and/or
statutory claims and seeking punitive damages. The majority of claimants do not allege physical
injury, but sue for medical monitoring and anxiety. On July&nbsp;12, 2007, we reached an agreement to
settle certain claims, including those associated with the 2005 and 2006 product communications,
which was amended on November&nbsp;19, 2007. Under the terms of the amended agreement, subject to
certain conditions, we would pay a total of up to $240&nbsp;million covering up to 8,550 patient claims,
including almost all of the claims that have been consolidated in the MDL as well as other filed
and unfiled claims throughout the United States. On June&nbsp;13, 2006, the Minnesota Supreme Court
appointed a single judge to preside over all Minnesota state court lawsuits involving cases arising
from the product communications. At the conclusion of the MDL settlement in 2010, 8,180 claims had

approximately $234&nbsp;million, and no other payments are due under the MDL settlement agreement. On
April&nbsp;6, 2009, September&nbsp;24, 2009, April&nbsp;16, 2010 and August&nbsp;30, 2010, the MDL Court issued orders
dismissing with prejudice the claims of most plaintiffs participating in the settlement; the claims
of settling plaintiffs whose cases were pending in state courts have been or will be dismissed by

April&nbsp;10, 2008, the Justice of Ontario Court certified a class of persons in whom defibrillators
were implanted in Canada and a class of family members with derivative claims. On May&nbsp;8, 2009, the

consumer protection statutes and unjust enrichment, for the cost of healthcare benefits they
allegedly paid in connection with the devices that have been the subject of Guidant&#146;s product

been revived as a result of the MDL Court&#146;s January&nbsp;15, 2010 order, and are pending in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Minnesota, although they are proceeding separately from the MDL.
A third action was recently remanded by the MDL Court to the U.S. District Court for the Southern

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">February&nbsp;2002 until May&nbsp;23 2005 and by Guidant&#146;s concealment of
this information, it engaged in repeated and
persistent fraudulent conduct in violation of the law. The New York Attorney General sought
permanent injunctive relief, restitution for patients in whom a VENTAK PRIZM&#174; 2 1861 defibrillator
manufactured before April&nbsp;2002 was implanted, disgorgement of profits, and all other proper relief.
The case was removed from New York State Court in 2005 and transferred to the MDL Court in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Minnesota in 2006. On April&nbsp;26, 2010, the MDL Court certified an
order remanding the remaining cases to the trial courts. On or about May&nbsp;7, 2010, the New York
Attorney General&#146;s lawsuit was remanded to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York. In December&nbsp;2010, Guidant and the New York Attorney General reached an agreement in principle
to resolve this matter. Under the terms of the settlement Guidant agreed to pay less than $1
million and to continue in effect certain patient safety, product communication and other
administrative procedure terms of the multistate settlement reached with other state Attorneys
General in 2007. On January&nbsp;6, 2011, the District Court entered a consent order and judgment
concluding the matter.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In October&nbsp;2005, Guidant received an administrative subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice
(DOJ), acting through the U.S. Attorney&#146;s office in Minneapolis, issued under the Health Insurance
Portability &#038; Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). The subpoena requested documents relating to
alleged violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act occurring prior to our acquisition of
Guidant involving Guidant&#146;s VENTAK PRIZM&#174; 2, CONTAK RENEWAL&#174; and CONTAK RENEWAL 2 devices. Guidant
cooperated with the request. On November&nbsp;3, 2009, Guidant and the DOJ reached an agreement in
principle to resolve the matters raised in the Minneapolis subpoena. Under the terms of the
agreement, Guidant would plead to two misdemeanor charges related to failure to include information
in reports to the FDA and we will pay approximately $296&nbsp;million in fines and forfeitures on behalf
of Guidant. We recorded a charge of $294&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2009 as a result of the
agreement in principle, which represents the $296&nbsp;million charge associated with the agreement, net
of a $2&nbsp;million reversal of a related accrual. On February&nbsp;24, 2010, Guidant entered into a plea
agreement and sentencing stipulations with the Minnesota U.S. Attorney and the Office of Consumer
Litigation of the DOJ documenting the agreement in principle. On April&nbsp;5, 2010, Guidant formally
pled guilty to the two misdemeanor charges. On April&nbsp;27, 2010, the District Court declined to
accept the plea agreement between Guidant and the DOJ. On January&nbsp;12, 2011, following a review of
the case by the U.S. Probation office for the District of Minnesota, the District Court accepted
Guidant&#146;s plea agreement with the DOJ resolving this matter. The Court placed Guidant on probation
for three years, with annual reviews to determine if early discharge from probation will be
ordered. During the probationary period, Guidant will provide the probation office with certain
reports on its operations. In addition, Boston Scientific voluntarily committed to contribute a
total of $15&nbsp;million to its Close the Gap and Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM)
education programs over the next three years.

has opened an investigation into whether there were civil violations under the False Claims Act
related to these products. On January&nbsp;27, 2011, the Civil division of the DOJ filed a civil False

violated federal law and the laws of the States of Tennessee, Florida and California by allegedly
concealing limited warranty and other credits for upgraded or replacement medical devices, thereby
allegedly causing hospitals to file reimbursement claims with federal and state healthcare programs
for amounts that did not reflect the providers&#146; true costs for the devices. On December&nbsp;20, 2010
the District Court granted the parties&#146; motion to suspend further proceedings following the parties

executive officers named in the demand letters, alleging breach of fiduciary duty in connection
with the alleged off-label promotion of surgical cardiac ablation system devices and seeking
unspecified damages, costs, and equitable relief. The parties have agreed to defer action on these
suits until after the Board of Director&#146;s determination whether to pursue the matter. On July&nbsp;26,
2010, the Board determined to reject the shareholders&#146; demand. In October&nbsp;2010, we and those of our

District Court for the District of Delaware seeking monetary and injunctive relief. On November&nbsp;10,
2008, Cordis filed a motion for summary judgment and on May&nbsp;1, 2009, we filed a motion to dismiss
the case. On May&nbsp;26, 2009, Cordis dismissed its request for injunctive relief. On July&nbsp;21, 2009,

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Guidant Sales Corp., Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. and Mirowski Family Ventures L.L.C. (Mirowski) were
plaintiffs in a suit originally filed against St. Jude Medical, Inc. and its affiliates in November
1996 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana alleging that certain ICD
systems marketed by St. Jude infringe a patent (the Mirowski patent) licensed to us. On March&nbsp;1,
2006, the District Court granted St. Jude&#146;s motion to limit damages to a subset of the accused
products but denied their motion to limit damages to only U.S. sales. On March&nbsp;26, 2007, the
District Court found the patent infringed but invalid. On December&nbsp;18, 2008, the Court of Appeals
upheld the District Court&#146;s ruling of infringement and overturned the invalidity ruling. On January
21, 2009, St. Jude and we filed requests for rehearing and rehearing en banc with the Court of
Appeals. On March&nbsp;6, 2009, the Court of Appeals granted St. Jude&#146;s request for a rehearing en banc
on a damages issue and denied our requests. On August&nbsp;19, 2009, the en banc Court of Appeals held
that damages were limited to U.S. sales only. On November&nbsp;16, 2009, Mirowski and we filed a
Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the U.S Supreme Court and on January&nbsp;11, 2010 the Supreme Court
denied the petition. The case was remanded back to the District Court for a trial on damages. On
April&nbsp;13, 2010, Mirowski and St. Jude reached a settlement in principle. On May&nbsp;6, 2010, Mirowski
and St. Jude reached a final settlement and the District Court dismissed the case with prejudice.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On November&nbsp;3, 2005, a securities class action complaint was filed on behalf of purchasers of
Guidant stock between December&nbsp;1, 2004 and October&nbsp;18, 2005 in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Indiana, against Guidant and several of its officers and directors. The
complaint alleges that the defendants concealed adverse information about Guidant&#146;s defibrillators
and pacemakers and sold stock in violation of federal securities laws. The complaint seeks a
declaration that the lawsuit can be maintained as a class action, monetary damages, and injunctive
relief. Several additional, related securities class actions were filed in November&nbsp;2005 and
January&nbsp;2006. The Court issued an order consolidating the complaints and appointed the Iron Workers
of Western Pennsylvania Pension Plan and David Fannon as lead plaintiffs. In August&nbsp;2006, the
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. On February&nbsp;27, 2008, the District Court granted the
motion to dismiss and entered final judgment in favor of all defendants. On March&nbsp;13, 2008, the
plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to amend the final judgment to permit the filing of a further
amended complaint. On May&nbsp;21, 2008, the District Court denied plaintiffs motion to amend the
judgment. On June&nbsp;6, 2008, plaintiffs appealed the judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit. On October&nbsp;21, 2009, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the District
Court granting our motion to dismiss the case with prejudice. Plaintiffs filed a motion to
reconsider, and on November&nbsp;20, 2009, the Court of Appeals denied the motion. The plaintiffs did
not seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court within the time allotted.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In January&nbsp;2006, we received a corporate warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three of our facilities and advising us that our
corporate-wide corrective action plan relating to three site-specific warning letters issued to us
in 2005 was inadequate. We identified solutions to the quality system issues cited by the FDA and
implemented those solutions throughout our organization. During 2008, the FDA reinspected a number
of our facilities and, in October&nbsp;2008, informed us that our quality system was in substantial
compliance with its Quality System Regulations. In November&nbsp;2009 and January&nbsp;2010, the FDA
reinspected two of our sites to follow up on observations from the 2008 FDA inspections. Both of
these FDA inspections confirmed that all issues at the sites have been resolved and all
restrictions related to the corporate warning letter were removed. On August&nbsp;11, 2010, we were
notified by the FDA that the corporate warning letter had been lifted.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On December&nbsp;11, 2007, Wall Cardiovascular Technologies LLC filed suit against us and Cordis
Corporation alleging that our TAXUS&#174; Express&#174; coronary stent system, and other products and
services related to coronary, carotid and peripheral stents, infringe a patent owned by it (the
Wall patent) and that Cordis&#146; drug-eluting stent
system infringes the patent. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District
of Texas and sought monetary and injunctive relief. Wall Cardiovascular Technologies later amended
its complaint to add Medtronic, Inc. and Abbott Laboratories to the suit with respect to their
drug-eluting stent systems. The parties entered into a settlement agreement resolving the matter

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In July&nbsp;2005, a purported class action complaint was filed on behalf of participants in Guidant&#146;s
employee pension benefit plans in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana
against Guidant and its directors. The complaint alleged breaches of fiduciary duty under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), specifically that Guidant
fiduciaries concealed adverse information about Guidant&#146;s defibrillators and imprudently made
contributions to Guidant&#146;s 401(k) plan and employee stock ownership plan in the form of Guidant
stock. The complaint sought class certification, declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary
damages, the imposition of a constructive trust, and costs and attorneys&#146; fees. In September&nbsp;2007,
we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. In June&nbsp;2008, the District
Court dismissed the complaint in part, but ruled that certain of the plaintiffs&#146; claims may go
forward to discovery. On October&nbsp;29, 2008, the Magistrate Judge ruled that discovery should be
limited, in the first instance, to alleged damages-related issues. On October&nbsp;8, 2009, we reached a
resolution with the plaintiffs in this matter for an amount not

2010, the District Court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement. On September&nbsp;9,

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On January&nbsp;19, 2006, George Larson filed a purported class action complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Massachusetts on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of our 401(k)
Retirement Savings Plan (401(k) plan) and Global Employee Stock Ownership Plan (GESOP)&nbsp;alleging
that we and certain of our officers and employees violated certain provisions under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and Department of Labor regulations.
Other similar actions were filed in early 2006. On April&nbsp;3, 2006, the District Court issued an
order consolidating the actions. On August&nbsp;23, 2006, plaintiffs filed a consolidated purported
class action complaint on behalf of all participants and beneficiaries of our 401(k) plan during
the period May&nbsp;7, 2004 through January&nbsp;26, 2006 alleging that we, our 401(k) Administrative and
Investment Committee (the Committee), members of the Committee, and certain directors violated
certain provisions of ERISA (the Consolidated ERISA Complaint). The Consolidated ERISA Complaint
alleged, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the 401(k)
plan&#146;s participants because they knew or should have known that the value of our common stock was
artificially inflated and was not a prudent investment for the 401(k) plan (the First ERISA
Action). The Consolidated ERISA Complaint sought equitable and monetary relief. On June&nbsp;30, 2008,
Robert Hochstadt (who previously had withdrawn as an interim lead plaintiff) filed a motion to
intervene to serve as a proposed class representative. On November&nbsp;3, 2008, the District Court
denied the plaintiffs&#146; motion to certify a class, denied Hochstadt&#146;s motion to intervene, and
dismissed the action. On December&nbsp;2, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. Following the
settlement of the Second ERISA Action described in the paragraph below, the First Circuit Court of
Appeals entered judgment dismissing the appeal in the First ERISA Action on October&nbsp;12, 2010.

understanding reflecting an agreement in principle to settle the First and Second ERISA Actions in
their entirety for an amount not material to us. The proposed settlement received preliminary
approval from the District Court. On August&nbsp;5, 2010, the District Court held a settlement fairness

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Except as discussed above, we recognize compensation expense for our stock using a straight-line
method over the substantive vesting period. Most of our stock awards provide for immediate vesting
upon death or disability of the participant. Prior to mid-2010, we expensed stock-based awards,
other than market-based awards, over the period between grant date and retirement eligibility or
immediately if the employee is retirement eligible at the date of grant. For awards granted after
mid-2010, other than market-based awards, retirement-eligible employees must provide one year of
service after the date of grant in order to accelerate the vesting and retain the award, should
they retire. Therefore, for awards granted after mid-2010, we expense stock-based awards over the
greater of the period between grant date and retirement-eligibility date or one year. The
market-based awards discussed above do not contain provisions that would accelerate the full
vesting of the awards upon retirement-eligibility.

grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates. The term &#147;forfeitures&#148; is distinct from &#147;cancellations&#148; or &#147;expirations&#148; and represents

provides for the granting of options to purchase up to 20&nbsp;million shares of our common stock to all

beginning of each six-month offering period, an option to purchase shares of our common stock equal
to not more than ten percent of the employee&#146;s eligible compensation or the statutory limit under
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Such options may be exercised generally only to the extent of
accumulated payroll deductions at the end of the offering period, at a purchase price equal to
90&nbsp;percent of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning or end of each offering
period, whichever is less. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, there were approximately 5&nbsp;million shares

the Guidant purchase accounting, we recognized deferred costs of $86&nbsp;million for the fair value of
the shares that were unallocated on the date of acquisition. Common stock held by the ESOP was
allocated among participants&#146; accounts on a periodic basis until these shares were exhausted and
were treated as outstanding in the computation of earnings per share. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and
2009, all of the common stock held by the ESOP had been allocated to employee accounts. Allocated
shares of the ESOP were charged to expense based on the fair value of the common stock on the date

Effective June&nbsp;1, 2008, this plan was merged into our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan.

Entities, </I>to require that an enterprise perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise&#146;s
variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE).
The analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both 1) the
power to direct activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity&#146;s economic
performance and 2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits
from the entity. Update No.&nbsp;2009-17 eliminated the quantitative approach previously required for
determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE and requires ongoing reassessments of whether an
enterprise is the primary beneficiary. We adopted Update No.&nbsp;2009-17 for our first quarter ended
March&nbsp;31, 2010. The adoption of Update No.&nbsp;2009-17 did not have any impact on our results of

including an upfront payment of $1.426&nbsp;billion, and $24&nbsp;million which was placed into escrow to be
released upon the completion of local closings in certain foreign jurisdictions, and will receive
$50&nbsp;million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which
we expect will be completed over a period of approximately 24&nbsp;months. We are providing transitional
