<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are an early stage blank check company formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset
acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination. We intend to acquire and operate a business in the energy industry
and believe our management team is well suited to identify opportunities that have the potential to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders, although we may pursue a business combination opportunity in any business or
industry. For our purposes, we define the energy industry as companies that own and operate assets that are used in or provided services to the energy sector, including, but not limited to, assets used in exploring, developing, producing,
transporting, storing, gathering, processing, fractionating, refining, distributing or marketing of natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil or refined products. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our management team and Kayne Anderson, an affiliate of our sponsor, have extensive experience in the energy industry&#151;ranging from
operating and acquiring companies within multiple sectors of the industry to making public and privately negotiated investments in the industry. We believe this experience makes us very well situated to identify, source, negotiate and execute a
business combination with an attractive energy-related target. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe a key advantage in sourcing potential business combination
targets is the network of contacts our management team and Kayne Anderson have, which includes senior executives in the industry, investment bankers, investment professionals at private equity firms and other financial sponsors and owners of private
businesses. We believe Kayne Anderson&#146;s reputation and expertise in the energy industry will make us a preferred partner for potential business combination targets. Another key sourcing advantage is Kayne Anderson&#146;s existing investment
activity in the energy industry, as we believe this will provide us with unique access to potential business combination targets. Further, we believe these industry relationships and investment activity give us a deep understanding of macro trends,
investor expectations and market sentiment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The domestic energy industry continued to recover from a multi-year downturn during 2017.
Crude oil prices steadily increased during the second half of the year, which enabled many energy companies to increase their activity levels. More recently, crude oil prices have settled in a trading range of approximately $60 to $65 per barrel,
and many experts are forecasting prices to be relatively stable over the next few years. This outlook for prices is supported by a much improved supply/demand balance and should result in a very favorable operating environment for the domestic
energy sector over the next few years. In particular, the United States is expected to produce record levels of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids during 2018, and is expected to be the largest source of global supply growth over the
next three to five years. We are very optimistic about the sector&#146;s outlook over this timeframe. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While the operating environment for
the domestic energy sector is meaningfully improved, access to capital for many energy companies remains challenging. We believe the magnitude and length of the sector&#146;s downturn has negatively impacted investors&#146; perception of the sector
and willingness to invest in energy companies. We expect valuations and access to capital will improve to better reflect industry fundamentals, but this will take time. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that many domestic energy companies, which need access to capital to grow their businesses, could view a business combination with
us to be an attractive alternative. More challenging market conditions for publicly traded midstream companies &#150; our primary area of focus continues to be a business combination in the midstream sector &#150; makes it less likely such companies
will aggressively pursue large M&amp;A opportunities (reducing our competition for such assets). Further, a more challenging market for private midstream companies to complete an initial public offerings makes a business combination with us a more
viable alternative to access the public markets. </P>

utilizing a disciplined investment process when reviewing candidates for our initial business combination. Our management team and the investment professionals at Kayne Anderson are industry experts with the ability to identify attractive business
combination candidates and capitalize on favorable industry trends. The diversity of our operating and investing experience will enable us to consider candidates in multiple sectors within the energy industry (with an emphasis on the midstream
sector) and target the area with the most compelling potential returns. We believe this flexibility increases the probability of successfully executing on our business strategy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Kayne Anderson was founded in 1984 by Ric Kayne and John Anderson and has grown through a disciplined investment philosophy that emphasizes
niche opportunities with attractive return expectations and lower risk characteristics. As of January&nbsp;31, 2018, Kayne Anderson had approximately $27&nbsp;billion under management, and of that amount, $17&nbsp;billion was invested in energy
companies. Today, the firm is recognized as a premier asset manager specializing in energy, credit, equity marketable securities, specialty real estate and growth private equity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Kayne Anderson&#146;s track record in energy investing began in 1992, and since that time the firm has raised nine upstream-focused private
equity funds and numerous hedge <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">funds,&nbsp;closed-end&nbsp;funds</FONT> and separate accounts focused on investing in energy marketable securities. The firm has approximately 60 professionals focused on energy
investing, including former industry executives, petroleum engineers, investment bankers and research analysts. As of January&nbsp;31, 2018, the firm managed $7&nbsp;billion in energy private equity funds and $10&nbsp;billion in energy marketable
securities funds. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Chief Executive Officer and a Senior Managing Director of Kayne Anderson, Robert Purgason, has over 35 years of
experience in the energy industry, most recently serving as senior vice president, Access at Williams Companies, Inc. responsible for the Central Operation Area and Operational Excellence for the entire enterprise. Mr.&nbsp;Purgason has deep
operational and commercial knowledge of midstream companies and has previously served as chief operating officer of Chesapeake Midstream Partners, L.L.C. and Crosstex Energy, L.P. Mr.&nbsp;Purgason&#146;s strong leadership abilities, deep technical
knowledge and energy-related M&amp;A expertise make him well suited to evaluate candidates for our initial business combination and to serve as our Chief Executive Officer. He has served on the Board of Directors and is the past Chairman of the
Texas Pipeline Association, the Board of Visitors Dean&#146;s Advisory Council for the College of Engineering at The University of Oklahoma, the Advisory Board for the Chemical Biological&nbsp;&amp; Materials Engineering School at The University of
Oklahoma and past Program Chair and Director of GPA Midstream Association, where he authored numerous technical and marketing papers. He is currently a member of the Dallas Wildcat Committee and the National Association of Corporate Directors.

energy marketable securities business, has over 30 years of experience advising and investing in upstream and midstream companies. He has deep, long-standing relationships in the energy industry and serves as chairman of the board and chief
executive officer of Kayne Anderson&#146;s four publicly traded <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">closed-end</FONT> funds (NYSE: KYN, KYE, KMF and KED) and is also on the board of directors of Range Resources Corporation (NYSE: RRC), a domestic

this strategy, we will look to find a target that (i)&nbsp;complements the experience of our management team and Kayne Anderson, (ii)&nbsp;can benefit from our team&#146;s operating and financial expertise and (iii)&nbsp;represents a compelling

entities affiliated with Kayne Anderson and/or one or more investors in funds or separate accounts managed by Kayne Anderson, which we refer to as an &#147;Affiliated Joint Acquisition.&#148; Any such parties
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">would&nbsp;co-invest&nbsp;only</FONT> if permitted by applicable regulatory and other legal limitations and to the extent considered appropriate. An Affiliated Joint Acquisition may be effected through <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">a&nbsp;co-investment</FONT> with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the business combination by issuing to such parties a class of
equity or equity-linked securities. The amount and other terms and conditions of any such specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. We are not obligated to make any specified future issuance and may determine not to do so.
This is not an offer for any specified future issuance. Pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our Class&nbsp;B common stock, any such specified future issuance would result in an adjustment to the conversion ratio such that our initial
stockholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage ownership at 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding plus all shares issued in the specified future issuance, unless
the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class&nbsp;B common stock agreed to waive such adjustment with respect to the specified future issuance at the time thereof. We cannot determine at this time whether a majority of the
holders of our Class&nbsp;B common stock would then agree to so waive such adjustment to the conversion ratio. They may waive such adjustment due to (but not limited to) the following: (i)&nbsp;closing conditions which are part of the agreement for
our initial business combination; (ii)&nbsp;negotiation with Class&nbsp;A stockholders on structuring an initial business combination; (iii)&nbsp;negotiation with parties providing financing which would trigger the anti-dilution provisions of the
Class&nbsp;B common stock; or (iv)&nbsp;as part of the Affiliated Joint Acquisition. If such adjustment is not waived, the specified future issuance would not reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class&nbsp;B common stock, but would
reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. If such adjustment is waived, the specified future issuance would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of both classes of our common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i)&nbsp;in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our
public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii)&nbsp;in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or
assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons, including an Affiliated Joint Acquisition as described above. However, we will only complete a business
combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, of the &#147;Investment Company Act&#148;. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business
combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a
substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares,
our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business
or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more
than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking
stockholder approval, as applicable. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially
unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot
assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. </P>

initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which
our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Business Combination Process </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
evaluating business combinations, we conduct a thorough due diligence review process. Our due diligence review process is specific to each target business, but includes among other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating
data, meetings with management and their financial sponsors (if applicable), an assessment of the commodity price risk of the business and our ability to mitigate such risks with
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">hedges,&nbsp;on-site&nbsp;inspection</FONT> of assets, discussion with customers, legal and environmental reviews and other reviews as we deem appropriate. We also utilize our expertise and Kayne Anderson&#146;s
expertise operating energy-related assets and evaluating operating projections, financial projections and determining the appropriate return expectations given the risk profile of the target business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with Kayne Anderson or our officers or
directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with Kayne Anderson or our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent
investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Members of our management team and our independent directors own, directly or indirectly, founder shares and/or private placement warrants
and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a
conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors were to be included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial
business combination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All of the members of our management team are employed by Kayne Anderson or affiliates of Kayne Anderson. Kayne
Anderson and its affiliates are continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Kayne Anderson and each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or
contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. For example, Kayne Anderson and certain of its officers currently are obligated by contract to
offer or allocate certain investment opportunities first to specific private funds managed by them. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or
she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of
Kayne Anderson and our officers or directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. In addition, we may, at our option, pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with an entity to which Kayne
Anderson or an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation. Any such entity <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">may&nbsp;co-invest&nbsp;with</FONT> us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could
raise additional proceeds to complete the business combination by making a specified future issuance to any such entity. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity
offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake
and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our officers and directors have agreed not to become an officer or director of any other special purpose acquisition company with a class of
securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business
combination within 24 months after the closing of our initial public offering. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Management Team </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of
their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member of our management team will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been
selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe our management
team&#146;s operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have
developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships in the energy industry. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses, our management team&#146;s relationships
with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Status as a Public Company </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe
our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business
combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to
the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than
the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business
combination with us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become
public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters&#146; ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation
consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders&#146; interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting
a company&#146;s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are an &#147;emerging
growth company,&#148; as defined in Section&nbsp;2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public
companies that are not &#147;emerging growth companies&#148; including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">a&nbsp;non-binding&nbsp;advisory</FONT> vote on executive
compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our
securities may be more volatile. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, Section&nbsp;107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an &#147;emerging growth company&#148;
can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section&nbsp;7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; can delay the adoption of
certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1)&nbsp;the last day of the fiscal year (a)&nbsp;following the fifth
anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b)&nbsp;in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07&nbsp;billion, or (c)&nbsp;in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of
our Class&nbsp;A common stock that is held <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">by&nbsp;non-affiliates&nbsp;exceeds</FONT> $700.0&nbsp;million as of the prior June&nbsp;30th, and (2)&nbsp;the date on which we have issued more than $1.0&nbsp;billion <FONT

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, we had funds available for a business combination in the amount of $366.0&nbsp;million, after payment of
$13.2&nbsp;million of deferred underwriting fees and before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination. With these funds we can offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners,
providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities,
or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, there can be no assurance that
third party financing will be available to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Significant Activities Since Inception </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&nbsp;4, 2017, we consummated our initial public offering of 35,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of Class&nbsp;A common
stock and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-third</FONT> of one warrant to purchase one share of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50
per share. The units were sold in our initial public offering at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $350.0&nbsp;million (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). Simultaneously with the
consummation of our initial public offering, we completed a private placement of 6,000,000 warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant, issued to our sponsor, generating total proceeds of $9.0&nbsp;million. On April&nbsp;21, 2017, the underwriters
exercised their over-allotment option in part and purchased 2,732,112 units, which were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $27.3&nbsp;million.&nbsp;Simultaneously with the unit sales in connection with the
over-allotment, we completed a private sale of an additional 364,281 warrants to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $0.5&nbsp;million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A total of $377.3&nbsp;million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering (including the partial over-allotment) and the private
placement with the sponsor were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company&#146;s public stockholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our units began trading on March&nbsp;30, 2017 on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol KAACU. Commencing on April&nbsp;30, 2017, the
securities comprising the units began separate trading. The units, common stock, and warrants are trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols &#147;KAACU,&#148; &#147;KAAC&#148; and &#147;KAACW,&#148; respectively.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;21, 2018, our Sponsor agreed to loan us up to $500,000, as needed, to fund our working capital needs. These loans will be <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-interest</FONT> bearing, and we expect to repay the loans at the closing of our Initial Business Combination. At the option of the lender, such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant,
at the time of our Initial Business Combination. Such warrants will be identical to private placement warrants issued simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We intend to
effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in
our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks
inherent in such companies and businesses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of
the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our Class&nbsp;A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to
us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. </P>

connection with the completion of our initial business combination (which may include a specified future issuance), and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the
trust account. In addition, we intend to target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, and may as a result be required to seek additional financing
to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial
business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek

anticipate that target business candidates will continue to be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including energy industry executives, investment bankers and investment professionals at private equity firms and other
financial sponsors. Target businesses are brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us. These sources introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis.
Our officers and directors, as well as our sponsor and their affiliates, also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they
have. In addition, we expect to continue to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our sponsor and
their affiliates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is

effect of any such transactions would be to seek to obtain the necessary number of votes in favor of our initial business combination, as our sponsor, directors and officers have agreed, pursuant to the letter agreement, to vote any founder shares
held by them and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. They will not make any such purchases when they
are in possession of any <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">material&nbsp;non-public&nbsp;information</FONT> not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation&nbsp;M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a
contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which
requires insiders to refrain from purchasing shares during certain periods and when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information and to clear all trades with our Chief Compliance Officer prior to execution. We cannot currently
determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Rule&nbsp;10b5-1&nbsp;plan,</FONT> as the decision whether to make such purchases pursuant to a
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Rule&nbsp;10b5-1&nbsp;plan</FONT> will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such

constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The purpose of such purchases would be to

shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public

their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the
shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder&#146;s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By
limiting our stockholders&#146; ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our
business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders&#146;
ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Tendering Stock Certificates
in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption
rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in &#147;street name,&#148; to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or up to two
business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company&#146;s DWAC
(Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder&#146;s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether
we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the
vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use
electronic delivery of their public shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of
certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee
would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such
delivery must be effectuated. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect
redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders&#146; vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed
business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to
deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an &#147;option window&#148; after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company&#146;s stock in the
market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders
were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become &#147;option&#148; rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or
electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder&#146;s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date
of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable
date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to
redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If our initial business combination is
not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will
promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. </P>

However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay franchise and income taxes on
interest income earned on the trust account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. </P>

will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar
claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an
agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management
believes that such third party&#146;s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third
party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider
willing to execute a waiver. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the
future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a
third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the
trust account to below (i)&nbsp;$10.00 per public share or (ii)&nbsp;such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case

underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be
responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor&#146;s only assets are securities
of our company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made
against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would
receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by third parties for services

whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification
obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the

due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all third parties, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in
or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We may
have access to amounts held outside of the trust account ($479,055 as of December&nbsp;31, 2017) to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than
approximately $100,000) but these amounts may be spent on expenses incurred as a result of being a public company or due diligence expenses on prospective business combination candidates. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently
determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by
them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 24&nbsp;months from the closing of our
initial public offering may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all
claims against it, including <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">a&nbsp;60-day&nbsp;notice</FONT> period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">a&nbsp;90-day&nbsp;period</FONT>
during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">additional&nbsp;150-day</FONT> waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with
respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&#146;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of
the dissolution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of
our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 24&nbsp;months from the closing of our initial public offering, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is
deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section&nbsp;174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating
distribution. If we are unable to complete our business combination within 24&nbsp;months from the closing of our initial public offering, we will: (i)&nbsp;cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii)&nbsp;as promptly as
reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">a&nbsp;per-share&nbsp;price,</FONT> payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account
including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public
shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#146; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii)&nbsp;as promptly as reasonably
possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the
requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the end of our 24 month period and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our
stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because we will not be complying with Section&nbsp;280, Section&nbsp;281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to
us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10&nbsp;years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating
company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from third parties (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As
described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all third parties, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us
waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would
result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i)&nbsp;$10.00 per public share or
(ii)&nbsp;such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and
will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be

To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file&nbsp;a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is

result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself
and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. </P>

will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder&#146;s voting in connection with the business
combination alone will not result in a stockholder&#146;s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. </P>

and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these
competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing
the business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and
our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial

exercising your redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public stockholders in which we describe our initial business combination. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination

combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to
meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon
consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters&#146; fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC&#146;s &#147;penny stock&#148; rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which
may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters&#146; fees and commissions or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and
may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most
desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business
combination, we will not know how many stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our
business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to
meet such requirements, or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in
the trust account or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. The above considerations may limit our ability
to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in
connection with a business combination. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">The&nbsp;per-share&nbsp;amount</FONT> we will distribute to stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting

gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, because we are obligated to pay cash for the shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock which our public stockholders redeem in connection with our initial

business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business. If we are
unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share (as of December&nbsp;31, 2017) on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>If the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants not being held in the trust account are insufficient, it
could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination and we will depend on loans from our sponsor or management team to fund our search for a business combination. If
we are unable to obtain these loans, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2017 we
have $479,055 held outside the trust account that is available to us and on March&nbsp;21, 2018, our Sponsor agreed to loan us up to $500,000, as needed, to fund additional working capital needs. If we are required to seek additional capital, we
would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Neither our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to
us in such circumstances. Any such advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our
sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. If we are unable to obtain these loans, we may
be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account.
Consequently, our public stockholders may only receive approximately $10.04 per share (as of December&nbsp;31, 2017) on our redemption of our public shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. </P>

other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will surface
all material issues that may be present inside a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our
control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">or&nbsp;write-off&nbsp;assets,</FONT> restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could
result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these
charges may <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">be&nbsp;non-cash&nbsp;items</FONT> and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our
securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">assuming&nbsp;pre-existing&nbsp;debt</FONT> held by a target business or
by virtue of our obtaining debt financing to partially finance the business combination. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such
stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third-party claims
against us. Although we have sought and will continue to seek to have all third parties, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or
claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against
the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect
to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives
available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party&#146;s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party
consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to
execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse
against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our business
combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders
could be less than the $10.00 per share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold
to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.00 per public share
or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes.
This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public
offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any
liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor&#146;s only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked
our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds
available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share
in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by third parties for services rendered or products sold to us and
prospective target businesses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the

because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from third parties (such as lawyers,

assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond

affected by a variety of factors, including depletion of resources, depressed commodity prices, access to capital for energy companies engaged in exploration and production, catastrophic events,
labor relations, increased environmental or other governmental regulation, equipment malfunctions and maintenance difficulties, volumes of imports or exports, international politics, policies of OPEC, and increased competition from alternative
energy sources. A decline in demand for energy commodities could result from factors such as adverse economic conditions; increased taxation; increased environmental or other governmental regulation; increased fuel economy; increased energy
conservation or use of alternative energy sources; legislation intended to promote the use of alternative energy sources; or increased commodity prices. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Commodity Pricing Risk.</I> The operations and financial performance of energy companies may be directly affected by energy commodity
prices, especially those companies that own the underlying energy commodity or receive payments for services that are based on commodity prices. Such impact may be a result of changes in the price for such commodity or a result of changes in the
price of one energy commodity relative to the price of another energy commodity (for example, the price of natural gas relative to the price of natural gas liquids). Commodity prices fluctuate for several reasons, including changes in market and
economic conditions, the impact of weather on demand, levels of domestic and international production, policies implemented by OPEC, energy conservation, domestic and foreign governmental regulation and taxation and the availability of local,
intrastate and interstate transportation systems. Volatility of commodity prices, which may lead to a reduction in production or supply, may also negatively impact the performance of energy companies that are solely involved in the transportation,
processing, storage, distribution or marketing of commodities. For example, crude oil and natural gas liquids prices declined by over 65% from July 2014 to February 2016. Prices have since increased but remain well below July 2014 levels. These
severe price declines have negatively impacted the capital expenditure budgets of energy companies engaged in exploration and production over the last few years. This reduction in activity levels resulted in a decline in domestic crude oil
production, which impacted the operating results and financial performance of energy companies focused on gathering, transporting, marketing and terminalling crude oil. Volatility of commodity prices may also make it more difficult for energy
companies to raise capital to the extent the market perceives that their performance may be directly or indirectly tied to commodity prices and there is uncertainty regarding these companies&#146; ability to maintain or grow cash distributions to
their equity holders. In addition to the volatility of commodity prices, extremely high commodity prices may drive further energy conservation efforts, which may adversely affect the performance of energy companies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Regulatory Risk.</I> Energy companies are subject to significant federal, state and local government regulation in virtually every aspect
of their operations, including (i)&nbsp;how facilities are constructed, maintained and operated, (ii)&nbsp;how services are provided, (iii)&nbsp;environmental and safety controls, and, in some cases (iv)&nbsp;the prices they may charge for the
products and services they provide. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. Various governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these regulations and the permits issued under them. As a
result, state or local governments and agencies may have the ability to significantly delay or stop activities such as hydraulic fracturing, disposal of wastewater or the construction of pipeline infrastructure by enacting laws or regulations or
making it difficult or impossible to obtain permits. Violators are subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including civil fines, injunctions or both. Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted in the future
which would likely increase compliance costs and may adversely affect the financial performance of energy companies. Additionally, government authorities, such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, and state authorities regulate the
rates charged on many types of midstream assets. Those authorities can change the regulations and, as a result, materially reduce the rates charged for these midstream assets, which may adversely affect the financial performance of Midstream Energy
Companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the last few years, several pipeline projects have experienced significant delays related to difficulties in obtaining the
necessary permits to proceed with construction (or some phase of construction). These delays have raised concerns about the ability of energy companies to place such projects in service and their ability to get the necessary financing to complete
such projects. Furthermore, it has become much more common for opponents of energy infrastructure development to utilize the courts, media campaigns and political activism to attempt to stop, or delay as much as possible, these projects. Significant
delays could result in a material increase in the cost of developing these projects and could result in the energy companies developing such projects failing to generate the expected return on investment or, if the project does not go forward,
realizing a financial loss, either of which would adversely affect the results of operations and financial performance of the affected energy companies. </P>

(both onshore and offshore) or spills attributable to railroad accidents may also adversely affect the financial performance of energy companies. Additionally, changes to laws and increased regulation or restrictions to the use of hydraulic
fracturing, the disposal of wastewater associated with hydraulic fracturing and production or the emission of greenhouse gases may adversely impact the ability of energy companies to economically develop oil and natural gas resources and, in turn,
reduce production of such commodities and adversely impact the financial performance of energy companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The operation of energy assets,
including gathering systems, pipelines, processing plants, fractionators, rail transloading facilities, refineries and other facilities, is subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Failure to
comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, and the issuance of orders enjoining
future operations. Certain environmental statutes, including RCRA, CERCLA, the federal Oil Pollution Act and analogous state laws and regulations, impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where
hazardous substances have been disposed of or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous
substances or other waste products into the environment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Federal, state and local governments may enact laws, and federal, state and
local agencies (such as the Environmental Protection Agency) may promulgate rules or regulations, that prohibit or significantly regulate the operation of energy assets. For instance, increased regulatory scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing, which is
used by energy companies to develop oil and natural gas reserves, could result in additional laws and regulations governing hydraulic fracturing or, potentially, prohibiting the action. Increased regulatory scrutiny of the disposal of wastewater,
which is a byproduct of hydraulic fracturing and production of unconventional reserves and must be disposed, could result in additional laws or regulations governing such disposal activities. For example, research exists linking the disposal of
wastewater to increased earthquake activity in oil and natural gas producing regions, and legislation and regulations have been proposed in states like Oklahoma and Colorado to limit or prohibit further underground wastewater disposal. While we are
not able to predict the likelihood of additional laws or regulations or their impact, it is possible that additional restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, wastewater disposal or any other activity necessary for the production of oil, natural gas or
natural gas liquids could result in a reduction in production of those commodities. The use of hydraulic fracturing is critical to the recovery of economic amounts of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids from unconventional reserves, and the
associated wastewater must be disposed. Energy companies have spent (and continue to spend) significant amounts of capital building midstream assets to facilitate the development of unconventional reserves. As a result, restrictions on hydraulic
fracturing or wastewater disposal could have an adverse impact on the financial performance of energy companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In response to
scientific studies suggesting that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases, including gases associated with oil and gas production such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide among others, may be contributing to a
warming of the earth&#146;s atmosphere and other adverse environmental effects, various governmental authorities have considered or taken actions to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. For example, the EPA has taken action to regulate greenhouse
gas emissions. In addition, certain states (individually or in regional cooperation), have taken or proposed measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Also, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have proposed legislative measures
for imposing restrictions or requiring emissions fees for greenhouse gases. The adoption and implementation of any federal, state or local regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, energy
companies could result in significant costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with their operations or could adversely affect the supply of or demand for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids or other hydrocarbon products,
which in turn could reduce production of those commodities. As a result, any such legislation or regulation could have a material adverse impact on the financial performance energy companies. </P>

significantly increase the cost for any remediation that may become necessary. Energy companies may not be able to recover these costs from insurance or recover these costs in the rates they charge customers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Natural gas transmission pipeline systems, crude oil transportation pipeline systems and certain of storage facilities and related assets
owned by energy companies are subject to regulation by the FERC. The regulators have authority to regulate natural gas pipeline transmission and crude oil pipeline transportation services, including; the rates charged for the services, terms and
conditions of service, certification and construction of new facilities, the extension or abandonment of services and facilities, the maintenance of accounts and records, the acquisition and disposition of facilities, the initiation and
discontinuation of services, and various other matters. Action by the FERC could adversely affect the ability of energy companies to establish or charge rates that would cover future increase in their costs, such as additional costs related to
environmental matters including any climate change regulation, or even to continue to collect rates that cover current costs, including a reasonable return. For example, effective January 2018, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changed several
provisions of the federal tax code, including a reduction in the maximum corporate tax rate. Following the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act being signed into law, filings have been made at FERC requesting that FERC require natural gas and liquids
pipelines to lower their transportation rates to account for lower taxes. Following the effective date of the law, FERC orders granting certificates to construct proposed natural gas pipeline facilities have directed pipelines proposing new rates
for service on those facilities to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-file</FONT> such rates so that the rates reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate, and FERC has issued data requests in pending certificate proceedings for proposed
natural gas pipeline facilities requesting pipelines to explain the impacts of the reduction in the corporate tax rate on the rate proposals in those proceedings and to provide <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-calculated</FONT> initial rates for
service on the proposed pipeline facilities. Furthermore, on March&nbsp;15, 2018, the FERC took a number of actions that could materially adversely impact energy companies. First, the FERC reversed a long-standing policy that allowed MLPs to include
an income tax allowance when calculating the transportation rates for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">cost-of-service</FONT></FONT> pipelines owned by such MLPs. Second, the FERC issued a notice of proposed
rulemaking to create a process to determine whether <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">cost-of-service</FONT></FONT> natural gas pipelines subject to FERC jurisdiction are overearning in light of either the lower
corporate tax rate or the FERC&#146;s policy change related to an MLP&#146;s ability to recover an income tax allowance. Third, with respect to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">cost-of-service</FONT></FONT> oil and
refined products pipelines, the FERC announced that it will account for the lower corporate tax rate and the FERC&#146;s policy change related to an MLP&#146;s ability to recover an income tax allowance in 2020 when setting the next cost inflation
index level, which index level sets the maximum allowable rate increases for oil and refined products pipelines and is set by FERC every five years. Finally, the FERC issued a notice of inquiry requesting comments as to how FERC should address
accumulated deferred income tax balances on the regulatory books of pipelines regulated by FERC as well as comments on any other effects of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Many experts believe it is likely that the proposed rule concerning natural
gas pipelines will be adopted <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">as-is</FONT> or in a form very close to what the FERC has proposed. As a result, many natural gas pipelines could be required to lower their transportation rates, either through the FERC
process or because shippers may challenge their rates. In addition, oil and refined products pipelines may be forced to reduce rates in 2020 or may not be able to increase rates as previously expected. Finally, the notice of inquiry could result in
additional adverse outcomes for pipeline owners, including potentially compensating shippers for the reduction in accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from either the lower corporate tax rate or the FERC&#146;s policy change related to an
MLP&#146;s ability to recover an income tax allowance, which compensation could take the form of material cash payments. The MLPs and energy companies that own the affected natural gas, oil or refined products pipelines could experience a material
reduction in revenues and cash flows, which may in turn materially adversely affect their financial condition and results of operations FERC may enact other regulations or issue further requests to pipelines which may lead to lower rates. Any such
change could have an adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of energy companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Depletion
Risk.</I> Energy reserves naturally deplete as they are produced over time, and to maintain or grow their revenues, companies engaged in the production of natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil and other energy commodities need to maintain or
expand their reserves through exploration of new sources of supply, through the development of existing sources, through acquisitions, or through long-term contracts to acquire reserves. The financial performance of these energy companies may be
adversely affected if they are unable to cost-effectively acquire additional reserves sufficient to replace the natural decline. If these energy companies fail to add reserves by acquiring or developing them, reserves and production will decline

acquire reserves, it may not be able to add or maintain its reserves or production levels. During the most recent industry downturn, many energy companies significantly reduced capital
expenditures to develop their acreage/undeveloped reserves. This reduction in activity levels resulted in declines in domestic production levels. Many energy companies were forced to monetize reserves or acreage to manage the balance sheets and
maintain adequate liquidity levels. Some energy companies were forced to file for bankruptcy in an effort to restructure their balance sheets. These actions have had a negative impact on the operating results and financial performance for energy
companies engaged in the transportation, storage, distribution and processing of production from such energy companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Reserve
Risks.</I> Energy companies engaged in the production of natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil and other energy commodities estimate the quantities of their reserves. If reserve estimates prove to be inaccurate, these companies&#146; reserves
may be overstated, and no commercially productive amounts of such energy commodities may be discovered. Furthermore, drilling or other exploration activities may be the curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of low commodity prices, unexpected
conditions or miscalculations, title problems, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents, adverse weather conditions, compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements and cost of, or shortages or
delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and other exploration equipment. In addition, there are many operational risks and hazards associated with the development of the underlying properties, including natural disasters, blowouts, explosions,
fires, leakage of such energy commodities, mechanical failures, cratering, and pollution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Catastrophic Event Risk.</I> Energy
companies are subject to many dangers inherent in the production, exploration, management, transportation, processing and distribution of natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, refined petroleum products and other hydrocarbons. These dangers
include leaks, fires, explosions, train wrecks, damage to facilities and equipment resulting from natural disasters, inadvertent damage to facilities and equipment (such as those suffered by BP&#146;s Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in the 2010
Macondo oil spill or recent oil spills by various onshore pipelines) and terrorist acts. The U.S. government has issued warnings that energy assets, specifically domestic energy infrastructure (e.g., pipelines), may be targeted in future terrorist
attacks. These dangers give rise to risks of substantial losses as a result of loss or destruction of reserves; damage to or destruction of property, facilities and equipment; pollution and environmental damage; and personal injury or loss of life.
Any occurrence of such catastrophic events could bring about a limitation, suspension or discontinuation of the operations of certain assets owned by such energy company. Energy companies may not be fully insured against all risks inherent in their
business operations and, therefore, accidents and catastrophic events could adversely affect such companies&#146; financial condition. We expect that increased governmental regulation to mitigate such catastrophic risk, such as the recent oil spills
referred to above, could increase insurance premiums and other operating costs for energy companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Acquisition Risk.</I> The
abilities of energy companies to grow can be highly dependent on their ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in cash flows. In the event that energy companies are unable to make such accretive acquisitions because they are unable
to identify attractive acquisition candidates and negotiate acceptable purchase contracts, because they are unable to raise financing for such acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, or because they are outbid by competitors, their future
growth will be limited. Furthermore, even if energy companies do consummate acquisitions that they believe will be accretive, the acquisitions may instead result in a decrease in cash flow. Any acquisition involves risks, including, among other
things: mistaken assumptions about volumes, revenues and costs, including synergies; the assumption of unknown liabilities; limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller; the diversion of management&#146;s attention from other business
concerns; unforeseen difficulties operating in new product or geographic areas; and customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Contract Rejection/Renegotiation Risk</I>. Energy companies that operate midstream assets are also subject to the credit risk of their
customers. For example, many energy companies that explore for and produce oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids filed for bankruptcy in the last few years as a result of the downturn in commodity prices. During the bankruptcy process, the debtor
energy company may be able to reject a contract that it has with a midstream company that provides services for the debtor, which services could include gathering, processing, transporting, fractionating or storing the debtor energy company&#146;s
production. If a contract is successfully rejected during bankruptcy, the affected midstream company will have an unsecured claim for damages but will likely only recover a portion of its claim for damages and may not recover anything at all. A
midstream company that provides services to an energy company that is in financial distress could experience a material adverse impact to its financial performance and results of operations. </P>

terrorist activities, war, and other geopolitical events, including the upheaval in the Middle East or other energy producing regions. The U.S. government has issued warnings that energy assets, specifically those related to pipeline and other
energy infrastructure, production facilities and transmission and distribution facilities, may be targeted in future terrorist attacks. Internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and energy companies or other
governments may affect the operations and profitability of energy companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Weather Risk</I>. Weather conditions and the seasonality
of weather patterns play a role in the cash flows of certain energy companies. Although most energy companies can reasonably predict seasonal weather demand based on normal weather patterns, extreme weather conditions, such as the hurricanes that
severely damaged cities along the U.S. Gulf Coast in the last 15 years, demonstrate that no amount of preparation can protect energy companies from the unpredictability of the weather. The damage done by extreme weather also may serve to increase
insurance premiums for energy assets owned by energy companies, could significantly increase the volatility in the supply of energy-related commodities and could adversely affect such companies&#146; financial condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Sector Specific Risk</I>. Energy companies are also subject to risks that are specific to the sector in which they operate. For example,
energy companies that operate midstream assets are subject to supply and demand fluctuations in the markets they serve which may be impacted by a wide range of factors including fluctuating commodity prices, weather, increased conservation or use of
alternative fuel sources, increased governmental or environmental regulation, depletion, rising interest rates, declines in domestic or foreign production, accidents or catastrophic events, and economic conditions, among others. These supply and
demand fluctuations could impact the aggregate volumes that are handled by midstream companies in North America or could impact supply flow patterns within North America, which could disproportionately impact certain midstream assets in one
geographic area relative to other geographic areas. Further, midstream companies are exposed to the natural declines in the production of the oil and gas fields they serve. Gathering and processing assets are most directly impacted by production
declines, as volumes will decline if new wells are not drilled and connected to a system, but all midstream assets could potentially be negatively impacted by production declines. For example, as a result of a substantial increase in new midstream
assets built over the last five years, several domestic shale basins have (or are expected to have) excess capacity to take supply <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">to&nbsp;end-user&nbsp;markets.</FONT> This excess capacity can lead to increased
competition among midstream companies and lower rates for services provided, which would have a negative impact on the operating results and financial performance for these companies. Further, many newly constructed midstream assets are underpinned
by contracts that contain minimum volume commitments for a period of years (typically five to ten years). If volumes are below the level of the minimum volume commitment at the time such commitments expire and/or the rates are above prevailing
market rates, the midstream company that owns the impacted midstream assets will experience a negative impact to its operating results and financial performance. In addition, some gathering and processing contracts subject the owner of such assets
to direct commodity price risk. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Exploration and production companies that own oil and gas reserves are particularly vulnerable to
declines in the demand for and prices of crude oil and natural gas. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, the accuracy of assumptions regarding future commodity prices and future exploration and
development costs and engineering and geological interpretations and judgments. Any significant variance from the assumptions used could result in the actual quantity of reserves and future net cash flow being materially different from those
estimated in reserve reports. Substantial downward adjustments in reserve estimates could have a material adverse effect on the value of such reserves and the financial condition of such company. In addition, due to natural declines in reserves and
production, energy companies must economically find or acquire and develop additional reserves in order to maintain and grow their production levels and cash flow. </P>

prove to be less favorable to investors in our initial public offering than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a business combination candidate. In the event we elect to pursue a business combination outside of the areas of
our management&#146;s expertise, our management&#146;s expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this report regarding the areas of our management&#146;s expertise would not be relevant

not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth

company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and
us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case,
we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of common stock, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding
shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company&#146;s stock than we initially

directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive approximately

by our initial stockholders, is and will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to
elect new directors prior to the completion of our business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of the business combination. If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of
our &#147;staggered&#148; board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election and our initial stockholders, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome.

then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least
50% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments

the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock upon exercise of these warrants and conversion rights could make us a less attractive business combination vehicle to a target business. Any such issuance will
increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock and reduce the value of the shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock issued to complete the business combination. Therefore, our warrants and founder shares may make it

to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of
holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We
could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class&nbsp;A common stock held
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">by&nbsp;non-affiliates&nbsp;exceeds</FONT> $700&nbsp;million as of any June&nbsp;30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December&nbsp;31. We cannot
predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities
may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile. </P>

accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or
revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">to&nbsp;non-emerging&nbsp;growth</FONT>
companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private
companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an
emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used. </P>

as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check
company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target company with which we seek to complete our business combination may not be in compliance
with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to

the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#147;Tax Reform Bill&#148;) was signed into law, reducing the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The enactment of the Tax Reform Bill did not impact our financial position or financial statements as of the
enactment date. Beginning January&nbsp;1, 2018, the Tax Reform Bill will reduce the amount of income tax that we expect to pay and will, all else equal, result in an increase to the investments held in our trust account. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other changes in the Tax Reform Bill that may impact us following our initial business combination are limitations on the deductibility of net
interest expense and limitations on the usage of net operating loss carryforwards (and elimination of carrybacks). While these new limitations will impact certain deductions to taxable income, we believe that the benefits of a lower federal
corporate tax rate will far outweigh such limitations. To the extent certain deductions are limited in any given year, we will be able to utilize such deductions in future periods if we have sufficient taxable income. The Tax Reform Bill also
repealed the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (&#147;AMT&#148;) for tax years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, the Tax
Reform Bill permits immediate expensing of qualified capital expenditures for the next five years. Following our Initial Business Combination, we expect this provision of the bill, all else equal, to defer the payment of income taxes resulting in
improved returns for our shareholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Results of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events </B></P>

Combination, at the earliest. Prior to such time, we will generate <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-operating</FONT> income in form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, we had a net loss of $187,108, which consisted
primarily of general and administrative expenses of $1,537,927 (including $45,000 administrative fees paid to related party and $1,091,667 of due diligence costs), franchise tax expense of $200,050 and income tax expense of $695,876. These expenses
were partially offset by interest received from the Trust Account of $2,246,745. During the second quarter of 2017, we incurred significant costs conducting due diligence around potential acquisitions that we are no longer pursuing. </P>

2017, upon the completing the Public Offering (including the sale of Over-Allotment Units) and the Private Placement Warrants, $377,321,120 was deposited in a trust account with American Stock Transfer&nbsp;&amp; Trust Company acting as trustee (the
&#147;Trust Account&#148;). Other than the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, the proceeds held in the Trust Account will remain in the Trust Account until the earlier (i)&nbsp;the completion of the Initial Business Combination; (ii)&nbsp;the
redemption of any shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock included in the Units sold in the Public Offering that have been properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company&#146;s certificate of incorporation to modify the
substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of such shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock if we do not complete the Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering; and (iii)&nbsp;the redemption of 100%
of the shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock included in the Units sold in the Public Offering if the Company is unable to complete an Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering (subject to the requirements
of law). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Until the consummation of the Public Offering, our liquidity needs were satisfied through loans from our Sponsor of $265,000
under an unsecured promissory note. The loans were <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-interest</FONT> bearing and were paid in full on April&nbsp;4, 2017 upon completion of the Public Offering. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, we had $479,055 in cash
held outside the Trust Account which may be used to pay for business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. In addition, interest income on the funds held in the Trust
Account may be released to pay our franchise and income taxes. During the year ended 2017, we paid $391,000 of estimated federal income tax with funds held in the Trust Account. At December&nbsp;31, 2017, $1,855,745 is available to pay any
additional taxes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;21, 2018, our Sponsor agreed to loan us up to $500,000, as needed, to fund our working capital needs.
These loans will be <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-interest</FONT> bearing, and we expect to repay the loans at the closing of our Initial Business Combination. At the option of our Sponsor, such loans may be convertible into warrants at a
price of $1.50 per warrant at the time of our Initial Business Combination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To the extent that we require additional funds to operate our
business prior to the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our Initial
Business Combination, we would repay such additional loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. In the event that our Initial Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside
the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans, including loans made under the March 2018 agreement, may be convertible into warrants,
at a price of $1.50 per warrant, at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants, including as to the exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. </P>

prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of a business combination. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be
responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. </P>

counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by NASDAQ and the SEC. </P>

do not have a standing nominating committee. In accordance with Rule&nbsp;5605(e)(1)(A) of the NASDAQ Rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for selection by the board of directors. The board of directors
believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. As there is no standing nominating committee, we
do not have a nominating committee charter in place. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The board of directors will also consider director candidates recommended for
nomination by our stockholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders). Our stockholders that wish to nominate a

minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional
experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders. </P>

consulting, management or other fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders in
connection with a proposed business combination. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining executive and director

employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after the initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our management&#146;s motivation
in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any
potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;21, 2018, our Sponsor agreed to loan us up to $500,000, as needed, to fund our
working capital needs. Any loans will be <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-interest</FONT> bearing and expect to be repaid or, at our Sponsor&#146;s option, converted into warrants at the closing of our Initial Business Combination at a price of
$1.50 per warrant. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our
sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us additional funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the
event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to
$1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds
in our trust account. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting,
management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our stockholders. It is
unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a stockholder meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the
directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have entered into a registration rights
agreement with respect to the founder shares and the private placement warrants, the warrants issuable upon conversion of working capital loans (if any) and the shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock issuable upon exercise of the foregoing and upon
conversion of the founder shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Director Independence </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">NASDAQ listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. As of the date of this report, a majority of our
board of directors is independent. An &#147;independent director&#148; is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the
company&#146;s board of directors, would interfere with the director&#146;s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that Messrs. Leland, Reinfrank and Borer are
&#147;independent directors&#148; as defined in the NASDAQ listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. </P>

statements of operations, changes in stockholders&#146; equity and cash flows, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and for the period from December 12, 2016 (inception) to December 31, 2016, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
&#147;financial statements&#148;). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
the year ended December 31, 2017 and for the period from December 12, 2016 (inception) to December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. </P>

responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#146;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (&#147;PCAOB&#148;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>

although substantially all of the net proceeds of the Public Offering are intended to be generally applied toward consummating an Initial Business Combination. The Initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses that
together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into
the Initial Business Combination. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect an Initial Business Combination. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company, after signing a definitive agreement for an Initial Business Combination, will either (i)&nbsp;seek stockholder approval of the
Initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose in connection with which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the Initial Business Combination, for cash equal to their pro
rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, including interest but less taxes payable, or (ii)&nbsp;provide stockholders with the
opportunity to sell their Public Shares to the Company by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount in cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as
of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, including interest but less taxes payable. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of the Initial Business Combination or will allow
stockholders to sell their Public Shares in a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would
otherwise require the Company to seek stockholder approval, unless a vote is required by law or under rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market. If the Company seeks stockholder approval, it will complete its Initial Business Combination only if a majority
of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the Initial Business Combination. However, in no event will the Company redeem its Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001
upon consummation of the Initial Business Combination. In such case, the Company would not proceed with the redemption of its Public Shares and the related Initial Business Combination, and instead may search for an alternate Initial Business
Combination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Company holds a stockholder vote or there is a tender offer for shares in connection with an Initial Business

Initial Business Combination, including interest but less taxes payable. As a result, such shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock will be recorded at redemption amount and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Public Offering, in

subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem the Public Shares, at a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">per-share</FONT> price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on
the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay the Company&#146;s franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which
redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#146; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii)&nbsp;as promptly as reasonably possible following
such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company&#146;s remaining stockholders and the Company&#146;s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company&#146;s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims
of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. The Sponsor and the Company&#146;s officers and directors have entered into letter agreements with the Company, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares (as defined below) held by them if the Company fails to complete the Initial Business Combination within 24 months of the closing of the Public Offering. However, if the Sponsor
or any of the Company&#146;s directors, officers or affiliates acquire shares of Class A Common Stock in or after the Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such shares if the

unrecognized tax benefits as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 or 2016. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. No amounts were accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at
