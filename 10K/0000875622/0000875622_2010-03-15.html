<P align=justify><B>Overview</B> </P>
<P align=justify>We are a biopharmaceutical company involved in the development
of an injectable collagenase for multiple indications. We have a development and
license agreement with Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Auxilium&#148;) for
injectable collagenase (which Auxilium has named &#147;XIAFLEXTM&#148; (formerly known as
&#147;AA4500&#148;)) for clinical indications in Dupuytren&#146;s contracture, Peyronie&#146;s
disease and frozen shoulder (<I>adhesive capsulitis</I>), and Auxilium has an
option to acquire additional indications that we may pursue, including lipomas
and cellulite. </P>
<P align=justify><B>FDA Approval for Dupuytren&#146;s Contracture </B></P>
<P align=justify>Auxilium announced on February 2, 2010 that it received
marketing approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;)
for XIAFLEX for the treatment of adult Dupuytren&#146;s contracture patients with a
palpable cord as further described in this Item 1 under the heading &#147;Collagenase
for Treatment of Dupuytren&#146;s Contracture.&#148; Auxilium plans to launch XIAFLEX, the
only drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of Dupuytren&#146;s contracture, in
late March 2010. In its March 2010 presentation materials, Auxilium stated, &#147;We
believe there are at least 450,000 potential patients annually in [the] U.S. and
EU for Dupuytren&#146;s &amp; Peyronie&#146;s indications or &gt; $1 Billion opportunity,
based on market research and analysis.&#148; Further, Auxilium stated in its Form
10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2010 its belief that &#147;XIAFLEX has the
potential to become a blockbuster.&#148; Auxilium has also announced the list price
to distributors of XIAFLEX. In a February 17, 2010 press release, Auxilium
stated this list price will be $3,250 and that it anticipates that Dupuytren&#146;s
contracture patients treated with XIAFLEX will have 1.5 cords treated, on
average, and that each cord will be treated with an average of 1.1 vials of
XIAFLEX. As discussed in more detail below under the section titled &#147;Licensing
and Marketing Agreements,&#148; we will be entitled to low double-digit royalties for
net sales of XIAFLEX pursuant to our development and licensing agreement with
Auxilium.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Research and Development of Injectable Collagenase for
Multiple Indications</B> </P>
<P align=justify>We entered into a development and license agreement with
Auxilium on June 3, 2004, as amended on May 10, 2005 and December 15, 2005,
respectively (the &#147;Prior Auxilium Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which we granted to
Auxilium an exclusive worldwide license to develop, market and sell products
containing our injectable collagenase for the treatment of Dupuytren&#146;s
contracture, Peyronie's disease and frozen shoulder, as well as an exclusive
option to develop and license the technology for use in additional indications
other than dermal formulations labeled for topical administration.</P>
<P align=justify>On December 11, 2008, the parties amended and restated, in its
entirety, the Prior Auxilium Agreement (the &#147;Auxilium Agreement&#148;), which became
effective on December 17, 2008 upon the execution and effectiveness of the
Development, Commercialization and Supply Agreement, dated December 17, 2008
(the &#147;Pfizer Agreement&#148;) between Auxilium International Holdings, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Auxilium, and Pfizer, Inc. (&#147;Pfizer&#148;). Under the
Pfizer Agreement, Pfizer will market XIAFLEX for the treatment of Dupuytren&#146;s
contracture and Peyronie&#146;s disease in Europe and various other territories.</P>
<P align=justify>The Auxilium Agreement and other licensing agreements are
discussed more fully in this Item 1, under the section titled &#147;Licensing and
Marketing Agreements.&#148;</P>
<P align=justify>In its Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2010,
Auxilium stated that it plans &#147;to prioritize our development of additional
pipeline indications for XIAFLEX. We have previously taken a license for the
development and commercialization of Frozen Shoulder syndrome, but other areas
of interest could include cellulite and lipoma.&#148; In the event that Auxilium does
license XIAFLEX in other indications, we will be entitled to receive a certain
percentage of sublicense income and milestone payments for such indications
pursuant to the terms of the Auxilium Agreement.</P>

<P align=justify><B>Background on Collagenase </B></P>
<P align=justify>Collagenase is the only protease that can hydrolyze the triple
helical region of collagen under physiological conditions. The specific
substrate collagen comprises approximately one-third of the total protein in
mammalian organisms, and it is the main constituent of skin, tendon, and
cartilage, as well as the organic component of teeth and bone. The body relies
on endogenous collagenase production to remove dead tissue and collagenase
production is an essential biological mechanism, which regulates matrix
remodeling and the normal turnover of tissue. The <I>Clostridial</I> collagenase
produced by us has a broad specificity towards all types of collagen and is
acknowledged as much more efficient than mammalian collagenases.
<I>Clostridial</I> collagenase cleaves the collagen molecule at multiple sites
along the triple helix whereas the mammalian collagenase is only able to cleave
the molecule at a single site along the triple helix.</P>
<P align=justify>Collagenase is widely used for cell dispersion for tissue
disassociation and cell culture because it does not damage the cell membrane.
Since the main component of scar tissue is collagen, collagenase has been used
in a variety of clinical investigations to remove scar tissue without surgery.
Histological and biochemical studies have shown that the tissue responsible for
the deformities associated with Dupuytren&#146;s contracture and Peyronie&#146;s disease
is primarily composed of collagen. Surgical removal of scar tissue has the
potential to result in complications including increased scar formation. Due to
the highly specific nature of the <I>Clostridial</I> collagenase enzyme, we
consider its use to be more desirable for the removal of unwanted tissue than
the application of general proteolytic enzymes. Treatment with injectable
collagenase for removal of excessive scar tissue represents a first in class
non-invasive approach to this unmet medical need. The lead indications involving
our injectable collagenase are Dupuytren&#146;s contracture, Peyronie&#146;s disease and
frozen shoulder. New clinical indications involving the therapeutic application
of <I>Clostridial</I> collagenase to supplement the body&#146;s own natural enzymes
are continuously being proposed to us by specialists in the medical
community.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Collagenase for Treatment of Dupuytren&#146;s Contracture
</B></P>
<P align=justify>Dupuytren&#146;s contracture is a deforming condition of the hand in
which one or more fingers contract toward the palm, often resulting in physical
disability. The onset of Dupuytren&#146;s contracture is characterized by the
formation of nodules in the palm that are composed primarily of collagen. As the
disease progresses, the collagen nodules begin to form a cord causing the
patient&#146;s finger(s) to contract, making it impossible to open the hand fully.
Patients often complain about the inability to wash their hands, wear gloves, or
grasp some objects. Dupuytren&#146;s contracture has a genetic basis and it is most
prevalent in individuals of northern European ancestry. Well-known individuals
with Dupuytren&#146;s contracture include President Ronald Reagan, President George
Bush, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</P>
<P align=justify>Prior to FDA approval of XIAFLEX, the only proven treatment for
Dupuytren&#146;s contracture was surgery. Recurrence rates after surgery can be as
high as 30% the first two years after surgery and 55% within ten years of
surgery. The post surgical recovery is often associated with significant pain,
delayed return to work, and extended periods of postoperative physical therapy.
Because many of the individuals with Dupuytren&#146;s contracture are older than 60,
there is considerable resistance from patients to undergo the surgical
procedure, which also involves the risk of general anesthesia. In addition, hand
surgeons note that surgery for Dupuytren&#146;s contracture is tedious, lengthy and
poorly reimbursed in the U.S. In a conference on February 8, 2007, Auxilium
stated that the average cost of Dupuytren&#146;s contracture surgery is $5,000 in the
U.S. and $3,500 in Europe. Auxilium has reported that U.S. based hand surgeons
would recommend the use of collagenase injection on 76% of the patients who are
candidates for surgery. This figure is consistent with an earlier survey that we
conducted, which found that U.S. hand surgeons would recommend the use of
collagenase injection on 80% of patients considered eligible for Dupuytren&#146;s
contracture surgery. Both of these surveys were conducted prior to the results
of the Auxilium Phase III trials being available.</P>
<P align=justify>We anticipate that many of the patients who are now willing to
live with the disease given the current treatment options would be receptive to
an alternative treatment involving a collagenase injection into the hand that
could be performed in doctor&#146;s office. As quoted in Auxilium&#146;s February 2, 2010
press release, &#147;&#145;With the safety and effectiveness of XIAFLEX demonstrated
across multiple clinical trials, physicians can now use XIAFLEX to treat any
symptomatic cords in patients with Dupuytren&#146;s contracture,&#146;&#148; said Larry Hurst,
M.D., study investigator and Professor and Chair, Department of Orthopaedics at
SUNY Stony Brook. &#147;&#145;I believe that XIAFLEX, as a new nonsurgical treatment,
could potentially become the standard of care for Dupuytren&#146;s contracture.&#146;&#148;

<P align=justify><I>FDA Approval of XIAFLEX </I></P>
<P align=justify>In a February 2, 2010 press release, Auxilium announced that it
received marketing approval from the FDA for XIAFLEX for the treatment of adult
Dupuytren's contracture patients with a palpable cord and expects to begin
shipping XIAFLEX to its distribution partners in early March 2010 for a launch
planned later that month. XIAFLEX is the only drug approved by the FDA for the
treatment of Dupuytren&#146;s contracture. The prescribing information for XIAFLEX
made available by Auxilium lists &#147;tendon ruptures or other serious injury to the
injected extremity&#148; as a reported serious adverse reaction to XIAFLEX. The
prescribing information for XIAFLEX also states that the most frequently
reported adverse drug reactions in XIAFLEX clinical trials included swelling of
the injected hand, contusion, injection site reaction, injection site
hemorrhage, and pain in the treated extremity. The prescribing information notes
that adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug may not
reflect those observed in practice because such trials &#147;are conducted under
widely varying conditions.&#148; </P>
<P align=justify>According to the February 2, 2010 Auxilium press release,
Auxilium plans to market and sell XIAFLEX in the United States through a team of
field sales managers and representatives, reimbursement specialists and managed
market account directors to experienced physicians who have &#147;attested to
completion of a training program.&#148; Auxilium will also have a staff of 11 &#147;highly
trained medical science liaisons&#148; providing medical support for XIAFLEX.
Auxilium also stated in its February 2, 2010 press release that: &#147;The FDA has
required a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program for XIAFLEX,
which consists of a communication plan and a medication guide. This REMS program
is designed (1) to evaluate and mitigate known and potential risks and serious
adverse events; (2) to inform healthcare providers about how to properly inject
XIAFLEX and perform finger extension procedures; and, (3) to inform patients
about the serious risks associated with XIAFLEX.&#148;</P>
<P align=justify>Auxilium has announced the pricing for list price to
distributors of XIAFLEX. According to a February 17, 2010 Auxilium press
release, this list price will be $3,250, and Auxilium anticipates that
Dupuytren&#146;s contracture patients treated with XIAFLEX will have 1.5 cords
treated, on average, and that each cord will be treated with an average of 1.1
vials of XIAFLEX. As discussed in more detail below under the section titled
&#147;Licensing and Marketing Agreements,&#148; we will be entitled to low double-digit
royalties for net sales of XIAFLEX pursuant to the Auxilium Agreement. </P>
<P align=justify><I>European Regulatory Review of XIAFLEX </I></P>
<P align=justify>On January 21, 2010, Pfizer and Auxilium announced that the
scientific/technical review procedure for the Marketing Authorization Approval
for XIAFLEX for Dupuytren&#146;s contracture in Europe had begun. Pfizer is
responsible for marketing XIAFLEX for Dupuytren&#146;s contracture and Peyronie&#146;s
disease in 27 member countries of the European Union and 19 other European and
Eurasian countries. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Collagenase for Treatment of Peyronie&#146;s Disease </B></P>
<P align=justify>Peyronie&#146;s disease is characterized by the presence of a
collagen plaque on the shaft of the penis, which can distort an erection and
make intercourse difficult or impossible in advanced cases. In some mild cases,
the plaque can resolve spontaneously without medical intervention. In severe
cases, the penis can be bent at a 90-degree angle during erection. Significant psychological distress has been noted in
patients with Peyronie&#146;s disease who are sexually active. Frequent patient
complaints include increased pain, painful erections, palpable plaque, penile
deformity, and erectile dysfunction. Patients with Peyronie&#146;s disease have been
reported to have an increased likelihood of having Dupuytren&#146;s contracture,
frozen shoulder, plantar fibromatosis, knuckle pads, hypertension and diabetes.
Peyronie&#146;s disease typically affects males in the range of 40-70 years. The
cause of Peyronie&#146;s disease is unknown, although some investigators have
proposed that it may be due to trauma or an autoimmune component. A number of
researchers have suggested that the incidence of Peyronie&#146;s disease has
increased due to the use of erectile dysfunction drugs.</P>

<P align=justify>Surgery is the only proven treatment for Peyronie&#146;s disease and
the results are variable. Surgery often results in shortening of the penis.
Auxilium has reported that 33% of Peyronie&#146;s disease patients who undergo
surgery are subsequently dissatisfied with the results and they frequently
require a penile implant. Patients with Peyronie&#146;s disease strongly desire
therapeutic alternatives to surgery. Auxilium has reported that 90% of
urologists would use collagenase injection to delay or avoid surgery. This
finding is consistent with a survey of urologists conducted for us.</P>
<P align=justify>Histological and biochemical studies indicate that the scarring

<P align=justify><I>Development Status </I></P>
<P align=justify>Phase I and II trials have been conducted and indicate the
possible effectiveness of Clostridial collagenase on Peyronie&#146;s disease.</P>
<P align=justify><I>Phase IIb Trial </I></P>
<P align=justify>On December 16, 2009, Auxilium announced top-line efficacy and
safety results from a Phase IIb trial of XIAFLEX for the treatment of Peyronie&#146;s
disease. Auxilium also announced that it plans to meet with the FDA in the
second quarter of 2010 to discuss the Phase IIb results, as well as a proposed
Phase III trial that potentially could be started in the second half of 2010.
The Phase IIb study was designed to measure efficacy endpoints of improvement in
penile curvature and improvement in patients&#146; sexual quality of life using the
Peyronie&#146;s disease Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) questionnaire. The PRO
measured four domains of patients' sexual quality of life (penile pain,
Peyronie's disease bother, intercourse discomfort and intercourse constraint) at
the end of 36 weeks. As quoted by Auxilium in its press release, &#147;&#145;XIAFLEX has
shown a sustained benefit at 36 weeks versus placebo for patients suffering from
Peyronie&#146;s disease,&#146;&#148; said Laurence A. Levine, MD, FACS, investigator and
Professor, Department of Urology, Rush University Medical Center. &#147;&#145;The drug had
a statistically significant reduction in penile curvature and demonstrated
statistically significant improved quality of life for patients as measured by
the PRO domain for Peyronie&#146;s disease bother. Getting these efficacy results
without the risks of surgical intervention would be an enormous advantage for
patients suffering from Peyronie&#146;s disease.&#146;&#148; </P>
<P align=justify>As reported by Auxilium on December 16, 2009: &#147;Overall, XIAFLEX
demonstrated a statistically significant change compared to placebo at 36 weeks
in both improvement in penile curvature (p=0.001) and the PRO Peyronie's disease
bother domain (p=0.046) . There was no statistically significant change in mean
scores between XIAFLEX and placebo in the PRO penile pain, intercourse
discomfort or intercourse constraint domains. XIAFLEX was well-tolerated and the
most common treatment related adverse events in the Phase IIb study were
consistent with adverse events reported in previous Peyronie's disease trials
with XIAFLEX, which included injection site bruising, edema and pain.&#148; </P>
<P align=justify>A mean improvement of 29.7% in penile curvature from baseline
to 36 weeks was seen (54.4 to 38.2) in patients receiving XIAFLEX as compared
with a mean improvement of 11.0% in patients receiving placebo (50.6 to 45.1);
(p=0.001) . In patients who received XIAFLEX, 60.5% of patients achieved the
endpoint of at least a 25% reduction in angle of curvature whereas 25.0% of
placebo patients achieved that same endpoint. With respect to the PRO domain for
Peyronie's disease bother, the overall XIAFLEX treatment arm experienced a
benefit in mean change in score from baseline to 36 weeks that was significantly
better than the overall placebo arm benefit (p=0.046) .</P>
<P align=justify>The Phase IIb study was a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial that was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of
XIAFLEX when administered two times a week, every six weeks, for up to three
treatment cycles (2 x 3). The study was conducted at 12 sites throughout the U.S.,
and 145 patients were monitored for 36 weeks following the first injection, with
109 patients receiving XIAFLEX as a series of intralesional injections and 36
receiving placebo (3:1 ratio) in the study. The treatment and placebo arms were
also randomized to test for a benefit with the addition of penile modeling
versus no modeling (1:1). Modeling refers to massaging of the plaque and is
intended to maximize the enzymatic effect of the XIAFLEX injection in the
plaque. </P>

<P align=justify><B>Collagenase For Treatment of Frozen Shoulder
(</B><B><I>Adhesive Capsulitis</I></B><B>) </B></P>
<P align=justify>Frozen shoulder is a clinical syndrome of pain and decreased
motion in the shoulder joint. It is estimated to affect 20 to 50 million people
worldwide with a slightly higher incidence in women. It is estimated that
700,000 patients visit doctors annually in the U.S. in connection with frozen
shoulder. It typically occurs between the ages of 40-70. Individuals with
insulin dependent diabetes have been reported to have a 36% higher incidence
rate and are more likely to have bilateral symptoms. One common therapy
currently available to treat frozen shoulder is manipulation, which is painful
and requires general anesthesia.<B> </B></P>
<P align=justify>We initiated, monitored and supplied requisite study drug for a
Phase II clinical trial using our injectable collagenase in the treatment of
frozen shoulder. Three different doses of injectable collagenase were compared
to placebo in this double-blind, randomized trial in 60 patients. Results of
this Phase II clinical trial were presented at the annual meeting of the
American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons in March 2006. Based on its prior
review of the data contained in the oral presentation, Auxilium elected to
exercise its option to develop and commercialize this additional indication for
collagenase injection in December 2005. In a press release dated December 20,
2005 and issued concurrently with the exercise of its option, Auxilium stated
its belief that &#147;the addition of a third indication for this development program
enhances the commercial potential of AA4500&#148; (now known as XIAFLEX). Auxilium
has reported that it is in Phase II of development for the treatment of frozen
shoulder.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Additional Clinical Indications For Collagenase</B></P>
<P align=justify><I>Lipomas </I></P>
<P align=justify>Lipomas are benign fatty tumors that occur as bulges under the
skin and affect humans and canines. It is estimated that lipomas are the primary
diagnosis in 575,000 patients in the U.S. annually. Lipomas are found in 2.3% of
dogs, and there may be as many as 1.7 million dogs affected with skin lipomas in
the United States. Based on observations made during preclinical studies that a
collagenase injection decreased the size of fat pads in animals, we initiated,
monitored and supplied the requisite study drug for a Phase I open label
clinical trial for the treatment of human lipomas with a single injection of
collagenase. Favorable initial results (10 out of 12 patients had a 50-90%
reduction in the size of the lipomas) from this trial for the treatment of
lipomas were presented at a meeting of the American Society of Plastic
Surgeons.</P>
<P align=justify>We have been developing clinical protocols for the treatment of
lipomas in humans, and this is an area that we are interested in exploring. We
have also been developing clinical protocols for dogs and have been working
closely with veterinarians concerning possible development plans in this area.
</P>
<P align=justify><I>Cellulite </I></P>
<P align=justify>Cellulite is a condition characterized by dimpling of the skin
and a mattress phenomenon typically affecting the thighs and buttocks. It is due
to irregular and discontinuous subcutaneous connective tissue. An open label
study has been completed to assess whether injectable collagenase can restore
the cellulite-affected areas to a more cosmetically acceptable appearance. An
abstract of an article titled &#147;Collagenase Injection in the Treatment of
Cellulite&#148; by A. Dagum and M.Badalamente, describing the promising results of
this study was published in <I>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery</I> on
September 15, 2006. BioSpecifics has not announced plans for any new studies in
cellulite.</P>

<P align=justify><I>Peyronie&#146;s Disease </I></P>
<P align=justify>On August 27, 2008, we entered into an agreement to improve the
deal terms related to our future royalty obligations for Peyronie&#146;s disease by
buying down our future royalty obligations with a one-time cash payment. A copy
of the agreement was filed on Form 8-K with the SEC on September 5, 2008.</P>
<P align=justify><I>Frozen Shoulder </I></P>
<P align=justify>On November 21, 2006, we entered into a license agreement (the
&#147;Frozen Shoulder License Agreement&#148;) with the Research Foundation, pursuant to
which the Research Foundation granted to us and our affiliates an exclusive
worldwide license, with the right to sublicense to certain third parties, to
know-how owned by the Research Foundation related to the development,
manufacture, use or sale of (i) the Enzyme and (ii) all pharmaceutical products
containing the Enzyme or injectable collagenase, in each case to the extent it
pertains to the treatment and prevention of frozen shoulder. Additionally, the
Research Foundation granted to us an exclusive license to the patent
applications in respect of frozen shoulder. The license granted to us under the
Frozen Shoulder License Agreement is subject to the non-exclusive license (with
right to sublicense) granted to the U.S. government by the Research Foundation
in connection with the U.S. government&#146;s funding of the initial research. </P>
<P align=justify>In consideration of the license granted under the Frozen
Shoulder License Agreement, we agreed to pay to the Research Foundation certain
royalties on net sales (if any) of pharmaceutical products containing the Enzyme
or injectable collagenase for the treatment and prevention of frozen shoulder
(each a &#147;Frozen Shoulder Licensed Product&#148;). In addition, we and the Research
Foundation will share in any milestone payments and sublicense income received
by us in respect of the rights licensed under the Frozen Shoulder License
Agreement. </P>

<P align=justify>Our obligation to pay royalties to the Research Foundation with
respect to sales by us, our affiliates or any sublicensee of any Frozen Shoulder
Licensed Product in any country (including the U.S.) arises only upon the first
commercial sale of a Frozen Shoulder Licensed Product. Our obligation to pay
royalties to the Research Foundation will continue until, the later of (i) the
expiration of the last valid claim of a patent pertaining to a Frozen Shoulder
Licensed Product or (ii) June 3, 2016.</P>
<P align=justify>Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its termination
provisions, the Frozen Shoulder License Agreement and licenses granted under
that agreement will continue in effect until the termination of our royalty
obligations. After that, all licenses granted to us under the Frozen Shoulder
License Agreement will become fully paid, irrevocable exclusive licenses. </P>
<P align=justify>In connection with the execution of the Dupuytren&#146;s License
Agreement and the Frozen Shoulder License Agreement, we made certain up-front
payments to the Research Foundation and the clinical investigators working on
the Dupuytren&#146;s contracture and frozen shoulder indications for the Enzyme. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Other Indications </I></P>
<P align=justify>We have entered into certain other license and royalty
agreements with respect to other indications that we may elect to pursue.</P>
<P align=justify><B>COMPETITION </B></P>
<P align=justify>We face worldwide competition from larger pharmaceutical
companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms,
universities and other research institutions and government agencies that are
developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products. Many of our competitors
have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have
and may subsequently develop products that are more effective, safer or less
costly than any products that we have developed, are developing or will develop,
or that are generic products. Our success will depend on our ability to acquire,
develop and commercialize products and our ability to establish and maintain
markets for our products that receive marketing approval.</P>
<P align=justify><B>COST OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES</B> </P>
<P align=justify>During fiscal years 2009 and 2008, the Company invested
$488,646 and $439,919, respectively, in research and development activities.</P>
<P align=justify><B>GOVERNMENT REGULATION</B></P>
<P align=justify>All of our products labeled for use in humans require
regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. In
particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical and
clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy and other approval procedures
of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries. Various
federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations also govern testing,
manufacturing, labeling, distribution, storage and record-keeping related to
such products and their promotion and marketing. The process of obtaining these
approvals and the compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign statutes
and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial
resources. In addition, the current political environment and the current
regulatory environment at the FDA could lead to increased testing and data
requirements which could impact regulatory timelines and costs. </P>
<P align=justify>Clinical trials involve the administration of the
investigational product candidate or approved products to human subjects under
the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under
protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study and the
parameters to be used in assessing the safety and the effectiveness of the drug.
Typically, clinical evaluation involves a time-consuming and costly three-phase
sequential process, but the phases may overlap. Each trial must be reviewed,
approved and conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review
board, and each trial must include the patient&#146;s informed consent. </P>
<P align=justify>Clinical testing may not be completed successfully within any
specified time period, if at all. The FDA monitors the progress of all clinical
trials that are conducted in the U.S. and may, at its discretion, reevaluate,
alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that
point and the FDA&#146;s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. The FDA
can also provide specific guidance on the acceptability of protocol design for
clinical trials. The FDA, we or our partners may suspend or terminate clinical
trials at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or
patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA can also
request that additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product
approval. During all clinical trials, physicians monitor the patients to
determine effectiveness and/or to observe and report any reactions or other
safety risks that may result from use of the drug candidate. </P>

noShade SIZE=5>
<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_14></A>
<P align=justify>Assuming successful completion of the required clinical trials,
drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials,
together with other detailed information including information on the chemistry,
manufacture and control of the product, to the FDA, in the form of an NDA or
BLA, requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In
most cases, the NDA/BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The FDA
reviews an NDA/BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe
and effective for its intended use.</P>
<P align=justify>Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the
facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not
approve the NDA or BLA unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA will
issue an approval letter if it determines that the NDA or BLA, manufacturing
process and manufacturing facilities are acceptable. If the FDA determines that
the NDA or BLA, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not
acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and will often
request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any
requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the NDA or
BLA does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve
the NDA or BLA by issuing a &#147;not approvable&#148; letter.</P>
<P align=justify>The testing and approval process requires substantial time,
effort and financial resources, which may take several years to complete. The
FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We or our partners may
encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our or their efforts to secure
necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us or them from
marketing our products. Furthermore, the FDA may prevent a drug developer from
marketing a product under a label for its desired indications or place other
conditions, including restrictive labeling, on distribution as a condition of
any approvals, which may impair commercialization of the product. After
approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new
indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject
to further FDA review and approval.</P>
<P align=justify>If the FDA approves the NDA or BLA, the drug can be marketed to
physicians to prescribe in the U.S. After approval, the drug developer must
comply with a number of post-approval requirements, including delivering
periodic reports to the FDA (i.e., annual reports), submitting descriptions of
any adverse reactions reported, biological product deviation reporting, and
complying with drug sampling and distribution requirements and any other
requirements set forth in the FDA&#146;s approval (such as a risk evaluation and
mitigation strategy program, which the FDA has required for XIAFLEX and consists
of a communication plan and a medication guide). The holder of an approved
NDA/BLA is required to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to
comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling. Also,
quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP
after approval. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to
register their facilities and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by
the FDA to assess compliance with cGMP which impose procedural and documentation
requirements relating to manufacturing, quality assurance and quality control.
Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the
area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and
other regulatory requirements. The FDA may require post-market testing and
surveillance to monitor the product&#146;s safety or efficacy, including additional
studies to evaluate long-term effects.</P>
<P align=justify>In addition to studies requested by the FDA after approval, a
drug developer may conduct other trials and studies to explore use of the
approved drug for treatment of new indications, which require submission of a
supplemental or new NDA/BLA and FDA approval of the new labeling claims. The
purpose of these trials and studies is to broaden the application and use of the
drug and its acceptance in the medical community.</P>
<P align=justify>We use, and will continue to use, third party manufacturers to
produce our products in clinical quantities. Future FDA inspections may identify
compliance issues at our facilities, at the facilities of our contract
manufacturers or at those of our partners that may disrupt production or
distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition,
discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with requirements
may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved
NDA/BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other
voluntary or FDA-initiated action that could delay further marketing. Newly
discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product&#146;s
approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications.
Also, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent
regulatory approval of our products under development. </P>

<P align=justify><B>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RIGHTS </B></P>
<P align=justify>Our success will depend in part on our ability to protect our
existing products and the products we acquire or in-license by obtaining and
maintaining a strong proprietary position both in the U.S. and in other
countries. To develop and maintain such a position, we intend to continue
relying upon patent protection, trade secrets, know-how, continuing
technological innovations and licensing opportunities. In addition, we intend to
seek patent protection whenever available for any products or product candidates
and related technology we develop or acquire in the future.</P>
<P align=justify><I>Patents </I></P>
<P align=justify>We are the assignee or licensee of five U.S. patents, which
have received patent protection in various foreign countries. In addition, we
have licenses to other pending patent applications. Although we believe these
patent applications, if they issue as patents, will provide a competitive
advantage, the scope of the patent positions of pharmaceutical firms involves
complex legal, scientific and factual questions and, as such, is generally
uncertain. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be
significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know
whether any of our current patent applications, or the products or product
candidates we develop, acquire or license will result in the issuance of patents
or, if any patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary
protection, will be of any value to us or will be challenged, circumvented or
invalidated by our competitors or otherwise.</P>
<P align=justify>While we attempt to ensure that our product candidates and the
methods we employ to manufacture them do not infringe other parties&#146; patents and
proprietary rights, competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe on
their proprietary rights. Because patent applications in the U.S. and some other
jurisdictions can proceed in secrecy until patents issue, third parties may
obtain other patents without our knowledge prior to the issuance of patents
relating to our product candidates, which they could attempt to assert against
us. Also, since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent
literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the
priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may
have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (the &#147;USPTO&#148;) or a foreign patent office to determine priority
of invention, or in opposition proceedings in a foreign patent office, either of
which could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is
favorable to us. There can be no assurance that the patents, if issued and
challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction, would be found valid or
enforceable. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to
third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or
require us to cease using such technology. </P>
<P align=justify>Although we believe that our product candidates, production
methods and other activities do not currently infringe the intellectual property
rights of third parties, we cannot be certain that a third party will not
challenge our position in the future. If a third party alleges that we are
infringing its intellectual property rights, we may need to obtain a license
from that third party, but there can be no assurance that any such license will
be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any infringement claim that results
in litigation could result in substantial cost to us and the diversion of
management&#146;s attention from our core business. To enforce patents issued to us
or to determine the scope and validity of other parties&#146; proprietary rights, we
may also become involved in litigation or in interference proceedings declared
by the USPTO, which could result in substantial costs to us or an adverse
decision as to the priority of our inventions. We may be involved in
interference and/or opposition proceedings in the future. We believe there will
continue to be litigation in our industry regarding patent and other
intellectual property rights.</P>
<P align=justify>We licensed to Auxilium our injectable collagenase for the
treatment of Dupuytren&#146;s contracture, Peyronie&#146;s disease, and frozen shoulder.
We have two use patents in the U.S. covering the enzyme underlying our
injectable collagenase, one for the treatment of Dupuytren&#146;s contracture, which
issued from a reissue proceeding in December 2007, and one for the treatment of
Peyronie&#146;s disease. The Dupuytren&#146;s patent expires in 2014, and the Peyronie&#146;s
patent expires in 2019. Both the Dupuytren&#146;s and Peyronie&#146;s patents are limited
to the use of the enzyme for the treatment of Dupuytren&#146;s contracture and
Peyronie&#146;s disease within certain dose ranges. Auxilium has submitted a patent application in connection with &#147;Compositions and Methods for
Treating Collagen Mediated Diseases,&#148; which, if not rejected, will extend the
royalty payments until 2027.</P>

<P align=justify><I>Orphan Drug Designations </I></P>
<P align=justify>Two indications, Dupuytren&#146;s contracture and Peyronie&#146;s
disease, have received orphan drug status from the FDA&#146;s Office of Orphan
Products Development (&#147;OOPD&#148;).</P>
<P align=justify>The OOPD administers the major provisions of the Orphan Drug
Act, an innovative program that provides incentives for sponsors to develop
products for rare diseases. <B></B>The incentives for products that qualify
under the Orphan Drug Act include seven-year exclusive marketing rights post FDA
approval (which means, with respect to Dupuytren&#146;s contracture, exclusivity
until February 2, 2017), tax credits for expenses associated with clinical
trials including a 20 year tax carry-forward, availability of FDA grants, and
advice on design of the clinical development plan. </P>
<P align=justify>The orphan drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act also provide incentives to drug and biologics suppliers to develop
and supply drugs for the treatment of rare diseases, currently defined as
diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or, for a
disease that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which
there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making
available in the U.S. a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered
from its sales in the U.S. Under these provisions, a supplier of a designated
orphan product can seek tax benefits, and the holder of the first FDA approval
of a designated orphan product will be granted a seven-year period of marketing
exclusivity for that product for the orphan indication. It would not prevent
other drugs from being approved for the same indication.</P>
<P align=justify>In its Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2010,
Auxilium stated that &#147;[w]hile XIAFLEX does not have orphan drug status for any
indication in Europe, foreign patents cover these products in certain countries,
and on approval of XIAFLEX for a first indication in Europe, we expect the
product will benefit from 10 years of market exclusivity and 8 years of data
exclusivity. We may obtain an additional year of market exclusivity if the
regulatory authorities approve an additional indication that they determine to
represent a significant clinical benefit.&#148;</P>
<P align=justify><I>Trade Secrets </I></P>
<P align=justify>We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential
and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that others will not
independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and
techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such
technology or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.</P>
<P align=justify>It is our policy to require certain employees, consultants,
outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to
execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or
consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential
information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the
individual&#146;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed
to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the
agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be our
exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements
will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in
the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. </P>

<P align=justify><B>Item 1A. </B><B>RISK FACTORS </B></P>
<P align=justify>In addition to the other information included in this Report,
the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future
prospects. Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of
operations. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize
or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual results may
vary materially from what we projected. There may be additional risks that we do
not presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also
impair our business or financial position. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Risks Related to Our Limited Sources of Revenue
</I></B></P>
<P align=justify><B>Our future revenue is primarily dependent upon option,
milestone and contingent royalty payments from Auxilium and technical assistance
payments and contingent earn out payments from DFB. </B></P>
<P align=justify>Our primary sources of revenues are from (i) option, milestone
and contingent royalty<B> </B>payments from Auxilium under the Auxilium
Agreement, (ii) payments from DFB for technical assistance we provide and
contingent earn out payments from DFB and (iii) the sale of small amounts of
collagenase for laboratory research.<B> </B></P>
<P align=justify>As described in Item 1 above, under the Auxilium Agreement, in
exchange for the right to receive royalties and other payments, we granted to
Auxilium the right to develop, manufacture, market and sell worldwide products
(other than dermal formulations for topical administration) that contain
collagenase for the treatment of Dupuytren&#146;s contracture, Peyronie&#146;s disease and
frozen shoulder. However, we have no control over Auxilium&#146;s ability to
successfully manufacture, market and sell candidate products for the treatment
of Dupuytren&#146;s contracture, Peyronie&#146;s disease, or, in the case of frozen
shoulder, to pursue commercialization, and we may receive limited, if any,
royalty payments from Auxilium. Moreover, such royalties are subject to certain
expenses we owe Auxilium under the Auxilium Agreement, including lyophilization
and certain patent costs. We have received in the past, and are entitled to
receive in the future, certain milestone payments from Auxilium in respect of
its efforts to commercialize such candidate products, but we have no control
over Auxilium&#146;s ability to achieve the milestones. Additionally, we have
received in the past, and are entitled to receive in the future, 8.5% of all
sublicense income that Auxilium receives from Pfizer under the Pfizer Agreement,
which payments are dependent on the achievement by Pfizer of certain regulatory
and sales related milestones, of which we have no control.</P>
<P align=justify>We have also granted to Auxilium an option to expand its
license and development rights to one or more additional indications for
injectable collagenase not currently licensed to Auxilium, including for the
treatment of lipomas and cellulite. If Auxilium exercises its option with
respect to an additional indication, we are entitled to receive a one-time
license fee for the rights to, as well as potential milestone and royalty
payments with respect to, such new indication. If Auxilium does not exercise its
option as to any additional indication, we may offer to any third party such
development rights with regard to products in the Auxilium Territory, provided
that we first offer the same terms to Auxilium, or develop the product
ourselves.<B> </B>Auxilium has no obligation to exercise its option with respect
to any such additional indication, and its decision to do so is in its complete
discretion. Clinical trials can be expensive and the results are subject to
different interpretations, therefore, there is no assurance that after
conducting Phase II clinical trials on any additional indication, and incurring
the associated expenses, Auxilium will exercise its option or we will receive
any revenue from it. Under the Auxilium Agreement, we may only offer to a third
party development rights with regard to products in the Auxilium Territory and
not in the Pfizer Territory. Auxilium&#146;s ability to develop or commercialize
additional indications in the Pfizer Territory are subject to negotiation with
Pfizer under the terms of the Pfizer Agreement.</P>
<P align=justify>As part of the sale of our topical collagenase business to DFB,
we are entitled to receive earn out payments in respect of sales of certain
products developed and manufactured by DFB that contain collagenase for topical
administration. However, our right to receive earn out payments from DFB is
dependent upon DFB&#146;s decision to pursue the manufacture and commercialization of
such products and its ability to achieve certain sales thresholds. We are aware
that DFB has certain competitive products that may adversely affect the volume
of sales of those topical collagenase products for which we are entitled to earn
out payments. </P>
<P align=justify>We also agreed to provide technical assistance to DFB&#146;s
affiliate, DPT Lakewood, for a fixed period of time in consideration for certain
payments and we are required to maintain certain scientific resources and
records in order to provide such assistance and be entitled to receive such
payments. </P>

<P align=justify><B>Our dependence upon revenue from Auxilium and DFB make us
subject to the commercialization and other risk factors affecting those two
companies over which we have limited or no control.</B></P>
<P align=justify>Auxilium has disclosed in its securities filings a number of
risk factors to consider when evaluating its business and future prospects.
Given our dependence upon revenue from Auxilium, Auxilium&#146;s operating success or
failure has a significant impact on our potential royalty stream and other
payment rights. As such, we refer you to the full text of Auxilium&#146;s disclosed
risk factors in its securities filings, which were most recently included on its
Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2010.</P>
<P align=justify>DFB is not a publicly traded company and therefore we have
little information about its business and future prospects. Although we cannot
be certain, we presume that many of the risk factors affecting Auxilium&#146;s
business may have some bearing in evaluating DFB&#146;s ability to meet its payment
obligations to us for technical assistance or to generate sufficient sales of
topical collagenase products to entitle us to receive any earn out payments.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Unstable market conditions may have serious adverse
consequences on our business. </B></P>
<P align=justify>Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by
unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the current equity and credit
markets deteriorate, or do not improve, it may make any necessary equity or debt
financing more difficult, more costly, and more dilutive. While we believe we
have adequate capital resources to meet our expected working capital and capital
expenditure requirements until at least the second half of 2012, a radical
economic downturn or increase in our expenses could require additional financing
on less than attractive rates or on terms that are excessively dilutive to
existing stockholders. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely
manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth
strategy, financial performance and stock price. In addition, there is a risk
that one or more of our partners may encounter difficulties during challenging
economic times, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Risks Related to Clinical Trials
</I></B></P>
<P align=justify><B>We have a limited supply of clinical material, which may
limit our ability to conduct other clinical trials and to obtain the associated
option, milestone and contingent royalty payments under the Auxilium Agreement.
</B></P>
<P align=justify>Although we currently have our own clinical material, if this
clinical material is damaged or otherwise becomes unusable, then we may have
insufficient clinical material to conduct other clinical trials. Auxilium has
agreed to provide us with additional clinical material, but there is no guaranty
that Auxilium will do so. Consequently, the lack of availability of clinical
material may limit our ability to obtain additional option, milestone and
royalty payments under the Auxilium Agreement.</P>
<P align=justify><B>If clinical trials for our potential new indications are
delayed, we may not be able to obtain option, milestone or royalty payments
under the Auxilium Agreement for new indications. </B></P>
<P align=justify>Clinical trials that we or our investigators may conduct may
not begin on time or may need to be restructured or temporarily suspended after
they have begun. Clinical trials can be delayed or may need to be restructured

<P align=justify>Conducting clinical trials and the testing, development and
manufacturing and distribution of product candidates are subject to regulation
by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, if we
desire to export the resulting products to such other jurisdictions. These
regulations govern or affect the testing, manufacture, safety, labeling,
storage, record-keeping, approval, distribution, advertising and promotion of
product candidates, as well as safe working conditions. Noncompliance with any
applicable regulatory requirements can result in suspension or termination of
any ongoing clinical trials of a product candidate or refusal of the government
to approve a product candidate for commercialization, criminal prosecution and
fines, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production,
prohibitions or limitations on the commercial sale of products or refusal to
allow the entering into of federal and state supply contracts. The FDA and
comparable governmental authorities have the authority to suspend or terminate
any ongoing clinical trials of a product candidate or withdraw product approvals
that have been previously granted. Even after a product candidate has been
approved, the FDA and comparable governmental authorities subject such product
to continuing review and regulatory requirements including, for example,
requiring the conducting and reporting of the results of certain clinical
studies or trials, commitments to voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials
and a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program, such as the one the FDA
has required for XIAFLEX and consists of a communication plan and a medication
guide. Currently, there is a substantial amount of congressional and
administrative review of the FDA and the regulatory approval process for drug
candidates in the U.S. As a result, there may be significant changes made to the
regulatory approval process in the U.S. In addition, the regulatory requirements
relating to the development, manufacturing, testing, promotion, marketing and
distribution of product candidates may change in the U.S. Such changes may
increase our costs and adversely affect our operations.</P>

applicable laws and regulations. </B></P>
<P align=justify>We are a small company and we rely heavily on third parties and
outside consultants to conduct many important functions. As a biopharmaceutical
company, we are subject to a large body of legal and regulatory requirements. In
addition, as a publicly traded company we are subject to significant
regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#147;SOX&#148;), some of which
have only recently been revised or adopted. We cannot assure you that we are or
will be in compliance with all potentially applicable laws and regulations.
Failure to comply with all potentially applicable laws and regulations could
lead to the imposition of fines, cause the value of our common stock to decline,
impede our ability to raise capital or list our securities on certain securities
exchanges. New rules could make it more difficult or more costly for us to
obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability
insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or
incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The
impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and
retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board
committees and as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount
of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs to comply with
these rules and regulations.</P>
<P align=justify><B>We may fail to maintain effective internal controls over
external financial reporting or such controls may fail or be

<P align=justify>SOX requires us to report annually on our internal controls
over financial reporting, and our business and financial results could be
adversely effected if we, or our independent registered public accounting firm,
determine that these controls are not effective. In addition, any failure or
circumvention of our internal controls and procedures or failure to comply with
regulations concerning controls and procedures could have a material effect on
our business, results of operation and financial condition. The impact of these

<P align=justify>We currently have only five employees. We may decide to pursue
other opportunities to in-license, acquire, develop and market additional
products and product candidates so that we are not solely reliant on Auxilium
and DFB sales for our revenues. Because we have limited internal research
capabilities, we are dependent upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
and other researchers and independent investigators to sell or license products
or technologies to us. The success of this strategy depends upon our ability to
identify, select and acquire the right pharmaceutical product candidates,
products and technologies.</P>
<P align=center>18 </P>
<HR style="PAGE-BREAK-AFTER: always" align=center width="100%" color=black

<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_22></A>
<P align=justify>We may not be able to successfully identify any commercial
products or product candidates to in-license, acquire or internally develop.
Moreover, negotiating and implementing an economically viable in-licensing
arrangement or acquisition is a lengthy and complex process. Other companies,
including those with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales
resources, may compete with us for the in-licensing or acquisition of product
candidates and approved products. We may not be able to acquire or in-license
the rights to additional product candidates and approved products on terms that
we find acceptable, or at all. If we are unable to in-license or acquire
additional commercial products or product candidates we may be reliant solely on
Auxilium and DFB sales for revenues. As a result, our ability to grow our
business or increase our revenues could be severely limited.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Even if we are able to develop any product candidates for
additional indications of injectable collagenase, we may not be able to obtain
option, milestone or royalty payments under the Auxilium Agreement, which could
impair our ability to grow and could cause a decline in the price of our common
stock. </B></P>
<P align=justify>The process of conducting clinical trials and developing
product candidates involves a high degree of risk and may take several years.
Product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development may
fail to reach the market for several reasons, including:</P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 10">clinical trials may show product candidates to be ineffective or not as
  effective as anticipated or to have harmful side effects or any unforeseen
  result;
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 10">product candidates may fail to receive regulatory approvals required to
  bring the products to market;
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 10">manufacturing costs, the inability to scale up to produce supplies for
  clinical trials or other factors may make our product candidates uneconomical;
  and
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 10">the proprietary rights of others and their competing products and
  technologies may prevent product candidates from being effectively
  commercialized or from obtaining exclusivity. </LI></UL>
<P align=justify>Success in preclinical and early clinical trials does not
ensure that large-scale clinical trials will be successful. Clinical results are
frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or
prevent regulatory approvals. The length of time necessary to complete clinical
trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision
by a regulatory authority varies significantly and may be difficult to predict.
Currently, there is substantial congressional and administration review of the
regulatory approval process for drug candidates in the U.S. Any changes to the
U.S. regulatory approval process could significantly increase the timing or cost
of regulatory approval for product candidates making further development
uneconomical or impossible. In addition, once Auxilium exercises its option with
respect to any additional indications, further clinical trials, development,
manufacturing, marketing and selling of such product is out of our control. Our
interest is limited to receiving option, milestone and royalty payments, and the
option in certain circumstances to manufacture according to particular
specifications set by Auxilium. </P>
<P align=justify>Any product acquisition or development efforts also could
result in large and immediate write-offs, incurrence of debt and contingent
liabilities or amortization of expenses related to intangible assets, any of
which could negatively impact our financial results.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Adverse events or lack of efficacy in clinical trials may
force us and/or our partners upon whom we are wholly dependent to stop
development of our product candidates or prevent regulatory approval of our
product candidates or significant safety issues could arise after regulatory
approval of our products, any of which could materially harm our business.

XIAFLEX and states that the most frequently reported adverse drug reactions in
XIAFLEX clinical trials included swelling of the injected hand, contusion,
injection site reaction, injection site hemorrhage, and pain in the treated
extremity. The prescribing information notes that adverse reaction rates
observed in clinical trials of a drug may not reflect those observed in practice
because such trials &#147;are conducted under widely varying conditions.&#148; </P>

and greater financial, scientific, marketing and human resources. These entities
include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and
not-for-profit institutions. Our competitors may succeed in developing products
or intellectual property earlier than we do, entering into successful
collaborations before us, obtaining approvals from the FDA or other regulatory
agencies for such products before us, or developing products that are more
effective than those we could develop. The success of any one competitor in
these or other respects will have a material adverse effect on our business, our
ability to receive option payments from Auxilium or ability to generate revenues
from third party arrangements with respect to additional indications for which
Auxilium does not exercise its option. <B></B></P>
<P align=justify><B>Because of the specialized nature of our business, the

<P align=justify>The competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology
field is intense, and we rely heavily on our ability to attract and contract
with qualified independent scientific and medical investigators, and technical
and managerial personnel. We face intense competition for qualified individuals
from numerous pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as
well as academic and other research institutions. To the extent we are unable to
attract and retain any of these individuals on favorable terms our business may
be adversely affected.</P>
<P align=justify><B>If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may

<P align=justify>We continue to have product liability exposure for topical
product sold by us prior to the sale of our topical business to DFB. In
addition, under the Auxilium Agreement, we are obligated to indemnify Auxilium
and its affiliates for any harm or losses they suffered relating to any personal
injury and other product liability resulting from our development, manufacture
or commercialization of any injectable collagenase product. In addition, the
clinical testing and, if approved, commercialization of our product candidates
involves significant exposure to product liability claims. We have clinical
trial and product liability insurance in the aggregate amount of $3 million
dollars that we believe is adequate in both scope and amount and has been placed
with what we believe are reputable insurers. We may not be able to maintain our
clinical trial and product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all,
and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims or
losses. If losses from product liability claims exceed our insurance coverage,
we may incur substantial liabilities that exceed our financial resources, and
our business and results of operations may be harmed. Whether or not we are
ultimately successful in product liability litigation, such litigation could
consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, and might
result in adverse publicity, all of which could impair our business.</P>

<P align=justify><B>If we breach any of the agreements under which we license
rights to products or technology from others, we could lose license rights that
are critical to our business and our business could be harmed. </B></P>
<P align=justify>We are a party to a number of license agreements by which we
have acquired rights to use the intellectual property of third parties that are
necessary for us to operate our business. If any of the parties terminates its
agreement, whether by its terms or due to our breach, our right to use the
party&#146;s intellectual property may negatively affect our licenses to Auxilium or
DFB and, in turn, their obligation to make option, milestone, contingent royalty
or other payments to us.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Our ability and the ability of our licensors, licensees and
collaborators to develop and license products based on our patents may be
impaired by the intellectual property of third parties.</B></P>
<P align=justify>Auxilium&#146;s, DFB&#146;s and our commercial success in developing and
manufacturing collagenase products based on our patents is dependent on these
products not infringing the patents or proprietary rights of third parties.
While we currently believe that we, our licensees, licensors and collaborators
have freedom to operate in the collagenase market, others may challenge that
position in the future. There has been, and we believe that there will continue
to be, significant litigation in the pharmaceutical industry regarding patent
and other intellectual property rights.</P>
<P align=justify>Third parties could bring legal actions against us, our
licensees, licensors or collaborators claiming damages and seeking to enjoin
clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of the affected product or
products. A third party might request a court to rule that the patents we
in-licensed or licensed to others, or those we may in-license in the future, are
invalid or unenforceable. In such a case, even if the validity or enforceability
of those patents were upheld, a court might hold that the third party&#146;s actions
do not infringe the patent we in-license or license to others, which could, in
effect, limit the scope of our patent rights and those of our licensees,
licensors or collaborators. Our agreements with Auxilium and DFB require us to
indemnify them against any claims for infringement based on the use of our
technology. If we become involved in any litigation, it could consume a
substantial portion of our resources, regardless of the outcome of the
litigation. If Auxilium or DFB becomes involved in such litigation, it could
also consume a substantial portion of their resources, regardless of the outcome
of the litigation, thereby jeopardizing their ability to commercialize candidate
products and/or their ability to make option, milestone or royalty payments to
us. If any of these actions is successful, in addition to any potential
liability for damages, we could be required to obtain a license to permit
ourselves, our licensees, licensors or our collaborators to conduct clinical
trials, manufacture or market the affected product, in which case we may be
required to pay substantial royalties or grant cross-licenses to our patents.
However, there can be no assurance that any such license will be available on
acceptable terms or at all. Ultimately, we, our licensees, licensors or
collaborators could be prevented from commercializing a product, or forced to
cease some aspect of their or our business, as a result of patent infringement
claims, which could harm our business or right to receive option, milestone and

<P align=justify>In addition, during May 2002, the Board implemented a rights
agreement (commonly known as a &#147;Poison Pill&#148;), which effectively discourages or
prevents acquisitions of more than 15% of our common stock in transactions
(mergers, consolidations, tender offer, etc.) that have not been approved by our
Board. These provisions could make it more difficult for common stockholders to
replace members of the Board. Because our Board is responsible for appointing
the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any
attempt to replace the current management team.</P>
<P align=justify><B>If our principal stockholders, executive officers and
directors choose to act together, they may be able to control our operations,
acting in their own best interests and not necessarily those of other
stockholders. </B></P>
<P align=justify>As of March 2, 2010 our executive officers, directors and their
affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially owned shares representing
approximately 36% of our common stock. Beneficial ownership includes shares over
which an individual or entity has investment or voting power and includes shares
that could be issued upon the exercise of options within 60 days. As a result,
if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they may be able to
control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our
management and affairs. For example, these individuals, if they chose to act
together, could control the election of directors and approval of any merger,
consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This
concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deferring or
preventing a change in control or impeding a merger or consolidation, takeover
or other business combination that could be favorable to other stockholders.</P>
<P align=justify>This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely
affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive
disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders.</P>

<P align=justify>Our corporate headquarters are currently located at 35 Wilbur
St., Lynbrook, NY 11563. As previously reported, ABC-NY (together with the
Company, the &#147;Tenant&#148;) and Wilbur St. Corp. (the &#147;Landlord&#148;), entered into a
Commercial Lease Agreement on January 30, 1998 (the &#147;Commercial Lease
Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which the Landlord leased to Tenant this space for a
term of 7 years or until January 31, 2005 and for an annual rental price of
$125,000.</P>
<P align=justify>Also as previously reported, the Tenant, without the approval
of the board of directors of the Company, and the Landlord entered into an
Extension and Modification Agreement on July 1, 2005 (the &#147;Modification
Agreement&#148; and together with the Commercial Lease Agreement, the &#147;Lease
Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which the term of the Commercial Lease Agreement was
extended for an additional 5 years or until June 30, 2010 and the annual rent
increased to $150,000. </P>

<P align=justify>In connection with the settlement of the previously reported

under the Modification Agreement, the parties entered into a Lease Modification
Agreement dated June 22, 2009 and effective as of June 24, 2009 (the &#147;LMA&#148;).
Pursuant to the LMA, the Tenant ratified the Lease Agreement, including the
Modification Agreement, subject to the terms thereof, and agreed to a $15,000
reduction in the annual rent to $135,000. The Lease Agreement expires on June

<P align=justify><B><I>Overview</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>We are a biopharmaceutical company involved in the development
of an injectable collagenase for multiple indications. Pursuant to the Auxilium
Agreement, we have licensed to Auxilium our injectable collagenase (which
Auxilium has named &#147;XIAFLEXTM&#148; (formerly known as &#147;AA4500&#148;)) for clinical
indications in Dupuytren&#146;s contracture, Peyronie&#146;s disease and frozen shoulder
(<I>adhesive capsulitis</I>), and Auxilium has an option to acquire additional
indications that we may pursue, including lipomas and cellulite. Auxilium has an
agreement with Pfizer pursuant to which Pfizer will market XIAFLEX for the
treatment of Dupuytren&#146;s contracture and Peyronie&#146;s disease in Europe and
various other territories.</P>
<P align=justify>Auxilium announced on February 2, 2010 that it received
marketing approval from the FDA for XIAFLEX for the treatment of adult
Dupuytren&#146;s contracture patients with a palpable cord as further described in
Item 1 of this Report under the heading &#147;Collagenase for Treatment of
Dupuytren&#146;s Contracture.&#148; Auxilium plans to launch XIAFLEX, the only drug
approved by the FDA for the treatment of Dupuytren&#146;s contracture, in late March
2010. In its March 2010 presentation materials, Auxilium stated, &#147;We believe
there are at least 450,000 potential patients annually in [the] U.S. and EU for
Dupuytren&#146;s &amp; Peyronie&#146;s indications or &gt; $1 Billion opportunity based on
market research and analysis.&#148;</P>
<P align=justify>Auxilium has also announced the list price to distributors of
XIAFLEX. In a February 17, 2010 press release, Auxilium stated this list price
will be $3,250 and that it anticipates that Dupuytren&#146;s contracture patients
treated with XIAFLEX will have 1.5 cords treated, on average, and that each cord
will be treated with an average of 1.1 vials of XIAFLEX. As discussed in more
detail under Item 1 above in the section titled &#147;Licensing and Marketing
Agreements,&#148; we will be entitled to low double-digit royalties for net sales of
XIAFLEX pursuant to our development and licensing agreement with Auxilium. </P>

<P align=justify>Pfizer and Auxilium announced, on January 21, 2010, that the
scientific/technical review procedure for the Marketing Authorization Approval
for XIAFLEX for Dupuytren&#146;s contracture in Europe had begun. Pfizer is
responsible for marketing XIAFLEX for Dupuytren&#146;s contracture and Peyronie&#146;s
disease in 27 member countries of the European Union and 19 other European and
Eurasian countries. </P>
<P align=justify>The Auxilium Agreement and other licensing agreements are
discussed more fully in Item 1 of this Report under the section titled
&#147;Licensing and Marketing Agreements.&#148;</P>
<P align=justify><B>Outlook </B></P>
<P align=justify>We foresee the potential to generate income from limited
sources in the next several years. In connection with the sale of our topical
collagenase business to DFB in March 2006, we continue to receive payments for
certain technical assistance and certain transition services that we provide to
DFB, as well as earn out payments based on the sales of certain products. Under
the Auxilium Agreement, in 2009 we received $6.375 million of the $75 million
upfront payment paid to Auxilium by Pfizer. In March 2010, we anticipate
receiving $1.275 million of the $15 million paid to Auxilium by Pfizer. We will
receive 8.5% of the $395 million in potential additional milestone payments that
may be made by Pfizer to Auxilium under the Pfizer Agreement. Of these
additional milestones, $135 million are tied to regulatory milestones and $260
million are based on sales milestones. In addition to the payments already
received by us with respect to the Dupuytren&#146;s contracture indication, Auxilium
will be obligated to make contingent milestone payments, with respect to each of
the Peyronie&#146;s disease and frozen shoulder indications, upon the acceptance of
the regulatory filing and receipt by Auxilium, its affiliate or sublicensee of
regulatory approval.</P>
<P align=justify>Based on our current business model, we expect to have adequate
cash reserves until at least the second half of 2012. As a significant portion
of our revenues is tied directly to the success of Auxilium in commercializing
XIAFLEX, we cannot reasonably forecast our financial condition beyond this time.
</P>
<P align=justify><B>Significant Risks</B></P>
<P align=justify>In recent history we have had operating losses and may not
achieve sustained profitability. As of December 31, 2009 we had an accumulated
deficit from continuing operations of approximately $8.4 million.</P>
<P align=justify>We are dependent to a significant extent on third parties, and
our principal licensee, Auxilium, may not be able to successfully develop
XIAFLEX for additional indications, obtain required regulatory approvals,
manufacture XIAFLEX at an acceptable cost, in a timely manner and with
appropriate quality, or successfully market products or maintain desired margins
for products sold, and as a result we may not achieve sustained profitable
operations. </P>
<P align=justify>As of December 31, 2009, we held no auction rate securities
(&#147;ARS&#148;). In October 2008, the Company received notice from UBS of a solution
that provided us the option to continue to hold our ARS or sell the securities
back to UBS at par value plus any accrued interest. On October 24, 2008 we
accepted UBS&#146;s offer and instructed UBS that we would notify them if and when we
want to exercise our rights and sell our ARS to UBS during the period January 2,
2009 through January 4, 2011. In early January 2009, we exercised our rights and
instructed UBS to sell all our remaining ARS. On January 6, 2009, we received
the remaining principal balance of our investment in auction rate securities of
$0.9 million.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions
</B></P>
<P align=justify>The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. While our significant accounting policies are described in more
detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we believe the
following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used
in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.</P>

<P align=justify><B><I>Revenue Recognition</I></B><I>.</I> We currently
recognize revenues resulting from product sales, the licensing and sublicensing
of the use of our technology and from services we sometimes perform in
connection with the licensed technology under the guidance of Accounting
Standards Codification 605, <I>Revenue Recognition</I> (&#147;ASC 605&#148;). </P>
<P align=justify>We recognize revenues from product sales when there is
persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, title passes, the price is fixed
and determinable, and payment is reasonably assured.</P>
<P align=justify>We enter into product development licenses and collaboration
agreements that may contain multiple elements, such as upfront license and
sublicense fees, and milestones related to the achievement of particular stages
in product development and royalties. As a result, significant contract
interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting,
including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple-element arrangement
should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition
purposes, and if so, how the aggregate contract value should be allocated among
the deliverable elements and when to recognize revenue for each element.</P>
<P align=justify>We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair
values of undelivered elements are known, when the associated earnings process
is complete and, to the extent the milestone amount relates to our performance
obligation, when our licensee confirms that we have met the requirements under
the terms of the agreement, and when payment is reasonably assured. Changes in
the allocation of the contract value between various deliverable elements might
impact the timing of revenue recognition, but in any event, would not change the
total revenue recognized on the contract. For example, nonrefundable upfront
product license fees for product candidates where we are providing continuing
services related to product development are deferred and recognized as revenue
over the development period.</P>
<P align=justify>Milestones, in the form of additional license fees, typically
represent nonrefundable payments to be received in conjunction with the
achievement of a specific event identified in the contract, such as completion
of specified clinical development activities and/or regulatory submissions
and/or approvals. We believe that a milestone represents the culmination of a
distinct earnings process when it is not associated with ongoing research,
development or other performance on our part. We recognize such milestones as
revenue when they become due and payment is reasonably assured. When a milestone
does not represent the culmination of a distinct earnings process, we recognize
revenue in a manner similar to that of an upfront product license fee. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Royalty/Earn-Out Revenue. </I></B>Under the DFB
Agreement, pursuant to which we sold our topical collagenase business, we have
the right to receive earn out payments in the future based on sales of certain
products. Generally, under this agreement we would receive royalty payments and
a report within ninety (90) days from the end of each calendar year after the
licensee has sold the royalty-bearing product. We recognize royalty revenues
when we can reliably estimate such amounts and collectability is reasonably
assured.<B><I> </I></B></P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Consulting and Technical Assistance Services. </I></B>We
recognize revenues from a consulting and technical assistance contracts
primarily as a result of our DFB Agreement and Auxilium Agreement. Consulting
revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. The consulting
obligations to DFB generally expire during March 2011.<B><I> </I></B></P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Inventory and Warranty Provisions</I></B><B>.</B>
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or realizable market value. In
assessing the ultimate realization of inventories, we are required to make
judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current
inventory levels. In March 2006 we sold our topical collagenase business to DFB,
including certain product inventory. As of a result of this sale our product
inventory as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was zero. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Reimbursable Third Party Development Costs.</I></B> We
accrue expenses for research and development and capitalize certain patent costs
related to estimated third party development costs that are reimbursable under
our agreement with Auxilium. Estimates are based on contractual terms,
historical development costs, reviewing third party data and expectations
regarding future development for certain products. Further, we monitor the
activities and clinical trials of our development partners. <B><I></I></B></P>
<P align=justify>If conditions or other circumstances change, we may take
actions to revise our reimbursable third party development cost estimates. These
revisions could result in an incremental increase or decrease in research and
development costs. For example, the Auxilium Agreement provides that Auxilium
and BioSpecifics will share equally in third party costs for the development of
the lyophilization of the injection formulation and certain patent expenses.</P>

<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_32></A>
<P align=justify>In January 2010, we received an updated invoice from Auxilium
for approximately $3.0 million which represents an increase of approximately
$0.2 million in the total amount due that Auxilium believes is owed by us
through year end 2009 under this provision. The increase in 2009 was primarily
due to patent and related legal fees. Based upon the updated invoice, we changed
our estimates for reimbursable third party development and certain patent costs
from approximately $2.8 million to approximately $3.0 million. </P>
<P align=justify>Based on our preliminary review, we believe that only a portion
of the amounts invoiced actually relates to the development of the
lyophilization of the injection formulation as well as for reimbursable patent
and related legal fees, and therefore, reserve all rights related to this
matter, including but not limited to our right to contest the amount charged by
Auxilium. In addition, we believe that this matter will be settled within
calendar year 2010 and have reclassified accrued third party development costs
as current liabilities at December 31, 2009.</P>
<P align=justify>Actual results have differed in the past, and may differ in the
future, from our estimates and could impact our earnings in any period during
which an adjustment is made.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Stock Based Compensation</I></B><B>.</B> Under the
Accounting Standards Codification 718, <I>Compensation - Stock Compensation</I>
(&#147;ASC 718&#148;), we estimate the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of
certain subjective assumptions. The most significant of these assumptions are
our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and
the expected term of an award. When establishing an estimate of the expected
term of an award, we consider the vesting period for the award, our recent
historical experience of employee stock option exercises (including forfeitures)
and the expected volatility. When there is uncertainty in the factors used to
determine the expected term of an award, we use the simplified method in
accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 107. As required under the
accounting rules, we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and, as
a result, our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock-based awards
granted in future periods may change. </P>
<P align=justify>Further, ASC 718 requires that employee stock-based
compensation costs be recognized over the requisite service period, or the
vesting period, in a manner similar to all other forms of compensation paid to
employees. Accordingly, in 2009 we recognized employee stock-based compensation
as part of our operating expenses and allocated $108,465 to research and
development expenses and $1,381,618 to general and administrative expenses.</P>
<P align=justify>We account for stock options granted to persons other than
employees or directors at fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 505-50, <I>Equity
Based Payments to Non-Employees</I> (&#147;ASC 505-50&#148;). Stock options granted to
such persons and stock options that are modified and continue to vest when an
employee has a change in employment status are subject to periodic revaluation
over their vesting terms. We recognize the resulting stock-based compensation
expense during the service period over which the non-employee provides services
to us. The stock-based compensation expense related to non-employees for the
year ended December 31, 2009 was zero. <B></B></P>

DECEMBER 31, 2008 </B></P>
<P align=justify><I>Product Revenues, net </I></P>
<P align=justify>Product revenues include the sales of the collagenase for
laboratory use recognized at the time it is shipped to customers. We had a small
amount of revenue from the sale of collagenase for laboratory use. For the
calendar years ended 2009 and 2008 product revenues were $39,035 and $37,343,
respectively. This increase of $1,692 or 5% was primarily related to the amount
of material required to perform testing and additional research by our
customers. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Royalties/Earn-Out </I></P>
<P align=justify>All of the royalty revenues we received in 2009 are from DFB
under the earn-out payment provision of the DFB Agreement. Total royalty
revenues recognized under that agreement were $1,271,597 and $510,126 for
calendar years 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase of $761,470, or 149%,
from calendar year 2008 to 2009 was due to certain sales levels achieved by DFB
in connection with the sale of topical collagenase. </P>

<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_33></A>
<P align=justify><I>Licensing, Sublicensing and Milestone Revenues </I></P>
<P align=justify>We recognized as licensing, sublicensing and milestone revenue
$1,565,125 and $7,440,125 in calendar years 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
decrease of $5,875,000, or 79%, from 2008 to 2009 was due to a sublicense fee of
$6,375,000 recognized in 2008 partially offset by a $500,000 milestone received
in 2009 in connection with the Auxilium Agreement. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Consulting Services </I></P>
<P align=justify>We recognize revenues from consulting and technical assistance
contracts primarily as a result of the DFB Agreement and a consulting agreement
signed in October 2007 with Auxilium. We recognize consulting revenues ratably
over the term of the contract. The consulting obligations under the DFB
Agreement generally expire during March 2011. For calendar years 2009 and 2008
we recognized $280,000 and $424,185, respectively, in consulting revenue. The
decrease of $144,185 or 34% from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to the
recognition in 2008 of revenues earned in connection with the October 2007
consulting agreement with Auxilium. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Research and Development Activities </I></P>
<P align=justify>Research and development expenses were $488,646 and $439,919
respectively, for calendar years 2009 and 2008, representing an increase from
2008 to 2009 of $48,727, or 11%. This increase was primarily due to certain
employee costs which were reimbursable under the DFB Agreement until October
2008 and stock-based compensation expense partially offset by decreases in
external study development costs. </P>
<P align=justify><I>General and Administrative Expenses </I></P>
<P align=justify>General and administrative expenses were $4,832,019 and
$4,191,052 for calendar years 2009 and 2008, respectively, an increase of
$640,967, or 15%, from 2008 to 2009. This increase was primarily due to outside
consulting services, certain facility costs which were reimbursable under the
DFB Agreement until October 2008, employee costs, legal fees and board member
service partially offset by a decrease in patent related fees and stock-based
compensation expense.<B> </B></P>
<P align=justify><I>Other Income and expense </I></P>
<P align=justify>Other income, for calendar year 2009 was $46,791 compared to
$262,811for calendar year 2008. Other income, during 2009 was due to interest of
$55,693 earned on our investments and other consisting of tax penalties of
$9,463 which was partially offset by a $600 gain related to an asset sale. Other
income during 2008 was due to interest earned of $107,552 on our investments, a
reversal of interest expense penalty of $80,409 associated with our delinquent
tax filings partially offset by an interest expense tax payment of $33,880 after
finalizing our delinquent tax returns, a reversal of accrued tax penalties of
$103,203 and a small gain from the sale of an asset of $5,527. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Income Taxes</I><B><I> </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The income tax benefit for 2009 was $161,574 as compared to an
income tax expense of $299,212 for 2008. In 2009 the Company utilized its
current federal NOL to carry-back to the 2008 tax year to claim a refund of
taxes paid of $198,239 which were partially offset by 2009 state tax of $1,784
and a $34,881 tax adjustment related to prior years&#146; tax returns. In 2008, we
accrued approximately $494,234 associated with federal and state taxes based on
our net income in 2008 which was partially offset by a tax benefit related to
the exercise of stock options of $314,648 and we recognized a $195,022 tax
benefit in connection with our 2007 net operating loss. </P>
<P align=justify>The Company&#146;s statutory marginal federal tax rate is 34%. The
effective rate for 2009 was (2.6%) reflecting the benefit derived from our net
operating loss carry-back, deferred revenue and stock based compensation. </P>

<P align=justify>To date, we have financed our operations primarily through
product sales, debt instruments, licensing revenues under agreements with third
parties and sales of our common stock. At December 31, 2009 and 2008 we had

<P align=justify>Net cash provided by operating activities in calendar year 2009
was $3,724,751, compared with net cash used in operating activities of
$3,101,055 in calendar year 2008. The change in net cash provided by operating
activities from 2008 to 2009 was primarily attributable to a reduction in
accounts receivable due to the receipt of a payment for a sublicense fee of
$6.375 million partially offset by an increase in earn-out royalties under
certain agreements, higher operating expenses and lower accounts payable and
accrued expenses. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Net Cash Used in Investing Activities </I></P>
<P align=justify>Net cash used in investing activities in calendar year 2009 was
$3,648,541, compared with $1,167,000 in calendar year 2008. The change in net
cash used in investing activities from 2008 to 2009 reflects our purchase of
marketable securities of $6,448,295 partially offset by the redemption of
marketable securities of $2,799,754. Net cash used in investing activities in
2008 reflects our investment in marketable securities of $2,000,000, a one-time
cash payment related to our future royalty obligations for Peyronie's disease of
$1,250,000 and by the sale or maturity of marketable securities of
$2,075,000.</P>

<P align=justify>Net cash provided by financing activities for calendar year
2009 was $380,029 as compared $7,693,641 for calendar year 2008. Net cash
provided by financing activities in 2009 was from proceeds received from stock
option exercises. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2008 consisted
of proceeds from the sale of our common stock of $6,007,047, repayment of an
outstanding loan from our former Chairman and CEO of $1,116,558, $314,648
related to excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements and

</B></P>
<P align=justify>The Company, under the supervision and with the participation
of Thomas L. Wegman, the Company&#146;s President, Principal Executive Officer and
Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report.
Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that the Company&#146;s disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Company&#146;s management, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management
necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. Furthermore, our controls and
procedures can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control, and
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected on a timely
basis. </P>

<P align=justify><B>Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting </B></P>
<P align=justify>Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company
as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company&#146;s internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to
the Company&#146;s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and
fair presentation of published financial statements and the reliability of
financial reporting.</P>
<P align=justify>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.</P>
<P align=justify>Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#147;COSO&#148;) in <I>Internal
Control &#150; Integrated Framework</I>. We believe that, as of December 31, 2009,
the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on
this criteria. </P>
<P align=justify>Tabriztchi &amp; Co, the independent registered public
accounting firm that audited our Consolidated Financial Statements included in
this Report, audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2009, as stated in their report which is included
in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</B></P>
<P align=justify>There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of our controls performed
during the year ended December 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.</P>

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material

on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). BioSpecifics

internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="2">We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects.&nbsp; Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk.&nbsp; Our audit also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.&nbsp; We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="2">A company's internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.&nbsp; A company's internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention of timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="2">Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. </font></p>

<P align=center><B>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements <BR>December 31,
2009 and 2008 </B></P>
<P align=justify><B>1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS </B></P>
<P align=justify>We are a biopharmaceutical company involved in the development
of an injectable collagenase for multiple indications. We have a development and
license agreement with Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Auxilium&#148;) for
injectable collagenase (which Auxilium has named &#147;XIAFLEX<SUP>TM</SUP>&#148;
(formerly known as &#147;AA4500&#148;)) for clinical indications in Dupuytren&#146;s
contracture, Peyronie&#146;s disease and frozen shoulder (<I>adhesive
capsulitis</I>), and Auxilium has an option to acquire additional indications
that we may pursue, including lipomas and cellulite. </P>
<P align=justify>We entered into the development and license agreement with
Auxilium on June 3, 2004, as amended on May 10, 2005 and December 15, 2005,
respectively (the &#147;Prior Auxilium Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which we granted to
Auxilium an exclusive worldwide license to develop, market and sell products
containing our injectable collagenase for the treatment of Dupuytren&#146;s
contracture, Peyronie's disease and frozen shoulder, as well as an exclusive
option to develop and license the technology for use in additional indications
other than dermal formulations labeled for topical administration.</P>
<P align=justify>On December 11, 2008, the parties amended and restated, in its
entirety, the Prior Auxilium Agreement (the &#147;Auxilium Agreement&#148;), which became
effective on December 17, 2008 upon the execution and effectiveness of the
Development, Commercialization and Supply Agreement, dated December 17, 2008
(the &#147;Pfizer Agreement&#148;) between Auxilium International Holdings, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Auxilium, and Pfizer, Inc. (&#147;Pfizer&#148;). Under the
Pfizer Agreement, Pfizer will market XIAFLEX for the treatment of Dupuytren&#146;s
contracture and Peyronie&#146;s disease in Europe and various other territories. </P>
<P align=justify><B>DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS</B></P>
<P align=justify>Prior to March 2006, we were a party to an exclusive license
agreement with Abbott Laboratories, Inc. and its subsidiaries, for the
production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for topical collagenase. In
March 2006 we sold our topical collagenase business to DFB Biotech, Inc. and its
affiliates (&#147;DFB&#148;), including all rights to the exclusive license agreement and
we were released of any obligations thereunder (the &#147;DFB Agreement&#148;).</P>
<P align=justify>In addition, at the closing of the DFB Agreement, DFB (i)
acquired from us certain inventory and manufacturing equipment used in the
topical collagenase business, (ii) was granted a perpetual royalty free license
to use, solely in connection with the topical collagenase business, certain
intangible assets retained by us and (iii) was granted the right (for a limited
period of time which was subsequently extended until October 2009) to use,
solely in connection with the topical collagenase business, certain tangible
assets retained by us. As part of the sale, we transferred to DFB our FDA
manufacturing license.</P>
<P align=justify>As consideration for the purchased assets we received $8
million in cash, DFB&#146;s assumption of certain liabilities, and the right to
receive earn out payments in the future based on sales of certain products. In
connection with the closing of the DFB Agreement, we agreed to provide certain
technical assistance and certain transition services to DFB in consideration of
fees and costs totaling over $1.4 million. At the closing, DFB paid to us a
partial payment of $400,000 in respect of the technical assistance to be
provided by us. As of December 31, 2009, we have received a total of $1.2
million in payments from DFB. The consulting obligations generally expire during
March 2011. </P>
<P align=justify><B>2</B>. <B>SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
</B></P>
<P align=justify><B>Principles of Consolidation </B></P>
<P align=justify>The audited consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiary, Advance Biofactures Corp.
(&#147;ABC-NY&#148;).</P>
<P align=center>
F-8<HR style="PAGE-BREAK-AFTER: always" align=center width="100%" color=black
noShade SIZE=5>

<P></P><A name=page_10></A>
<P align=justify><B>Management Estimates</B></P>
<P align=justify>The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the use
of management&#146;s estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments </B></P>
<P align=justify>Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are stated at
market value. Cash equivalents include only securities having a maturity of
three months or less at the time of purchase. The Company limits its credit risk
associated with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments by placing its
investments with banks it believes are highly creditworthy and with highly rated
money market funds, U.S. government securities, or short-term commercial
paper.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Fair Value Measurements </B></P>
<P align=justify>Accounting Standards Codification 820, <I>Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures</I>, requires expanded disclosures about fair value
measurements. We adopted these provisions relating to assets and liabilities
recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring
basis on January 1, 2008. The adoption of these provisions did not have a
material effect on our consolidated financial statements. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Auction Rate Securities</B> </P>
<P align=justify>As of December 31, 2009, we held no auction rate securities
(&#147;ARS&#148;). In October 2008, the Company received notice from UBS of a solution
that provided us the option to continue to hold our ARS or sell the securities
back to UBS at par value plus any accrued interest. On October 24, 2008 we
accepted UBS&#146;s offer and instructed UBS that we would notify them if and when we
want to exercise our rights and sell our ARS to UBS during the period January 2,
2009 through January 4, 2011. In early January 2009, we exercised our rights and
instructed UBS to sell all our remaining ARS. On January 6, 2009, we received
the remaining principal balance of our investment in auction rate securities of
$0.9 million. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Revenue Recognition </B></P>
<P align=justify>We currently recognize revenues resulting from product sales,
the licensing and sublicensing of the use of our technology and from services we
sometimes perform in connection with the licensed technology under the guidance
of Accounting Standards Codification 605, <I>Revenue Recognition</I> (&#147;ASC
605&#148;). </P>
<P align=justify>If we determine that separate elements exist in a revenue
arrangement under ASC 605, we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when
the fair values of undelivered elements are known, when the associated earnings
process is complete, when payment is reasonably assured and, to the extent the
milestone amount relates to our performance obligation, when our customer
confirms that we have met the requirements under the terms of the agreement.</P>
<P align=justify>Revenues, and their respective treatment for financial
reporting purposes, are as follows:</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Product Sales </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We recognize revenue from product sales when there is
persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, title passes, the price is fixed
or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. No right of return
exists for our products except in the case of damaged goods. To date, we have
not experienced any significant returns of our products. </P>
<P align=justify>Net sales include the sales of the collagenase for lab use that
are recognized at the time the product is shipped to customers for laboratory
use. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Royalty/Earn-Out Revenue</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Under the DFB Agreement, pursuant to which we sold our topical
collagenase business, we have the right to receive earn out payments in the
future based on sales of certain products. Generally, under this agreement we
would receive royalty payments and a report within ninety (90) days from the end
of each calendar year after the licensee has sold the royalty-bearing product.
We recognize royalty revenues when we can reliably estimate such amounts and
collectability is reasonably assured. </P>
<P align=center>F-9</P>
<HR style="PAGE-BREAK-AFTER: always" align=center width="100%" color=black
noShade SIZE=5>
<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_11></A>
<P align=justify><B><I>License and Sublicense Fees</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>We include revenue recognized from upfront licensing,
sublicensing and milestone payments in &#147;License Fees&#148; in our consolidated
statements of operations in this Report.</P>
<P align=justify><I>Upfront License and Sublicensing Fees</I></P>
<P align=justify>We generally recognize revenue from upfront licensing and
sublicensing fees when the agreement is signed, we have completed the earnings
process and we have no ongoing performance obligation with respect to the
arrangement. Nonrefundable upfront technology license for product candidates for
which we are providing continuing services related to product development are
deferred and recognized as revenue over the development period.</P>
<P align=justify><I>Milestones </I></P>
<P align=justify>Milestones, in the form of additional license fees, typically
represent nonrefundable payments to be received in conjunction with the
achievement of a specific event identified in the contract, such as completion
of specified development activities and/or regulatory submissions and/or
approvals. We believe that a milestone represents the culmination of a distinct
earnings process when it is not associated with ongoing research, development or
other performance on our part. We recognize such milestones as revenue when they
become due and collection is reasonably assured. When a milestone does not
represent the culmination of a distinct earnings process, we recognize revenue
in a manner similar to that of an upfront license fee. </P>
<P align=justify>The timing and amount of revenue that we recognize from
licenses of technology, either from upfront fees or milestones where we are
providing continuing services related to product development, is primarily
dependent upon our estimates of the development period. We define the
development period as the point from which research activities commence up to
regulatory approval of either our, or our partners&#146; submission assuming no
further research is necessary. As product candidates move through the
development process, it is necessary to revise these estimates to consider
changes to the product development cycle, such as changes in the clinical
development plan, regulatory requirements, or various other factors, many of
which may be outside of our control. Should the FDA or other regulatory agencies
require additional data or information, we would adjust our development period
estimates accordingly. The impact on revenue of changes in our estimates and the
timing thereof is recognized prospectively over the remaining estimated product
development period. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Consulting and Technical Assistance Services </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We recognize revenues from consulting and technical assistance
contracts primarily as a result of our DFB Agreement and Auxilium Agreement.
Consulting revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. The
consulting obligations to DFB generally expire during March 2011.<B><I>
</I></B></P>
<P align=justify><B>Accounts receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
</B></P>
<P align=justify>The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses which when
realized have been within the range of management&#146;s expectations. Our policy is
to write off bad debts as uncollectible when it is determined that they cannot
be collected.</P>
<P align=justify>As of December 31, 2009, accounts receivables include
approximately $1.3 million due from DFB in accordance with the terms of the
Asset Purchase Agreement. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement with DFB, we
receive royalty payments and a report within ninety (90) days from the end of
each calendar year after the licensee has sold the royalty-bearing product.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Reimbursable Third Party Development Costs</B></P>
<P align=justify>We accrue expenses to research and development for estimated
third party development costs and capitalize certain patent costs that are
reimbursable under our agreement with Auxilium. Estimates are based on
contractual terms, historical development costs, reviewing third party data and
expectations regarding future development for certain products. Further, we
monitor the activities and clinical trials of our development partners. </P>
<P align=center>F-10</P>
<HR style="PAGE-BREAK-AFTER: always" align=center width="100%" color=black
noShade SIZE=5>
<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_12></A>
<P align=justify>If conditions or other circumstances change, we may take
actions to revise our reimbursable third party development cost estimates. These
revisions could result in an incremental increase or decrease in research and
development costs. For example, the Auxilium Agreement provides that Auxilium
and BioSpecifics will share equally in third party costs for the development of
the lyophilization of the injection formulation and certain patent expenses.</P>
<P align=justify>In January 2010, we received an updated invoice from Auxilium
for approximately $3.0 million which represents an increase of approximately
$0.2 million in the total amount due that Auxilium believes is owed by us
through year end 2009 under this provision. The increase in 2009 was primarily
due to patent and related legal fees. Based upon the updated invoice, we changed
our estimates for reimbursable third party development and certain patent costs
from approximately $2.8 million to approximately $3.0 million. </P>
<P align=justify>Based on our preliminary review, we believe that only a portion
of the amount charged actually relates to the development of the lyophilization
of the injection formulation as well as for reimbursable patent and related
legal fees and, therefore, reserve all rights related to this matter, including
but not limited to our right to contest the amount charged by Auxilium. In
addition, we believe that this matter will be settled within calendar year 2010
and have reclassified accrued third party development costs as current
liabilities at December 31, 2009.</P>
<P align=justify>Actual results have differed in the past, and may differ in the
future, from our estimates and could impact our earnings in any period during
which an adjustment is made.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Research and Development Expenses</B></P>
<P align=justify>Our research and development (&#147;R&amp;D&#148;) costs are expensed as
incurred. R&amp;D includes, but is not limited to, internal costs, such as
salaries and benefits, costs of materials, lab expense, facility costs and
overhead. R&amp;D also consists of third party costs, such as medical
professional fees, contract manufacturing costs for material used in clinical
trials, consulting fees and costs associated with clinical study R&amp;D
arrangements. We fund R&amp;D at medical research institutions under agreements
that are generally cancelable. All of these costs are charged to R&amp;D as
incurred, which may be measured by percentage of completion, contract
milestones, patient enrollment, or the passage of time. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Clinical Trial Expenses</B></P>
<P align=justify>Our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of
the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with various
clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations. In the normal course
of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial
activities in the ongoing development of potential drugs. The financial terms of
these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract
and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under the contracts depend on
factors such as the achievement of certain events, the successful enrollment of
patients, the completion of portions of the clinical trial, or similar
conditions. The objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of
expenses in our financial statements to the actual cost of services received and
efforts expended. As such, expenses related to each patient enrolled in a
clinical trial are recognized ratably beginning upon entry into the trial and
over the course of the patient&#146;s continued participation in the trial. In the
event of early termination of a clinical trial, we accrue an amount based on our
estimate of the remaining non-cancelable obligations associated with the winding
down of the clinical trial. Our estimates and assumptions could differ
significantly from the amounts that may actually be incurred.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Stock Based Compensation </B></P>
<P align=justify>The Company has two stock-based compensation plans in effect
which are described more fully in Note 9. Accounting Standards Codification 718,
<I>Compensation - Stock Compensation </I>(&#147;ASC 718&#148;) requires the recognition of
compensation expense, using a fair-value based method, for costs related to all
share-based awards including stock options and common stock issued to our
employees and directors under our stock plans. It requires companies to estimate
the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an
option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately
expected to vest is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.</P>

<P align=justify>Under the ASC 718, we estimate the fair value of our employee
stock awards at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model,
which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions. The most significant
of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market
price of our stock and the expected term of an award. When establishing an
estimate of the expected term of an award, we consider the vesting period for
the award, our recent historical experience of employee stock option exercises
(including forfeitures) and the expected volatility. When there is uncertainty
in the factors used to determine the expected term of an award, we use the
simplified method. As required under the accounting rules, we review our
valuation assumptions at each grant date and, as a result, our valuation
assumptions used to value employee stock-based awards granted in future periods
may change. The ranges of valuation assumptions used were as follows: </P>

<P align=justify>In April 2009, the FASB issued an update to ASC 820, <I>Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures </I>(&#147;ASC 820&#148;)<I>,</I> to provide additional
guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and level of transaction
activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased in relation to
normal market activity for the asset or liability. Additional disclosures are
required regarding fair value in interim and annual reports. These provisions
are effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. We have
included these additional disclosures in Note 3.</P>
<P align=justify>In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC 855, <I>Subsequent Events
</I>(&#147;ASC 855&#148;),<I> </I>which provides guidance on events that occur after the
balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements. ASC
855 distinguishes events requiring recognition in the financial statements and
those that may require disclosure in the financial statements. Furthermore, ASC
855 requires disclosure of the date through which subsequent events were
evaluated. These requirements are effective for interim and annual periods after
June 15, 2009. We adopted these requirements for the quarter ended June 30,
2009, and have evaluated subsequent events through March 11, 2010.</P>
<P align=justify>In June 2009, the FASB issued an update of ASC 105,
<I>Generally Accepted Accounting Principles </I>(&#147;ASC 105&#148;), changing the
accounting for securitizations and special-purpose entities. ASC 105 enhances
disclosure requirements related to the transfers of financial assets, including
securitization transactions, and the continuing risk exposures related to
transferred financial assets. The concept of a &#147;qualifying special-purpose
entity&#148; is eliminated and the requirements for derecognizing financial assets
have been modified. ASC 105 modifies the criteria which determine whether an
entity should be consolidated. ASC 105 enhances the disclosure requirements
related to an entity&#146;s involvement with variable interest entities and any
changes to the related risk exposure. ASC 105 will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of these standards will have on our financial statements and related
disclosures.</P>
<P align=justify>In June 2009, the FASB issued an update of ASC 105,

the FASB Accounting Standards Codification<SUP>TM</SUP>, or Codification, which
supersedes all existing accounting standard documents and has become the single

<P align=justify>In September 2009, the EITF reached final consensus on Issue
08-1, <I>Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables</I>, or Issue 08-1,
which will update ASC 605 and changes the accounting for certain revenue
arrangements. The new requirements change the allocation methods used in
determining how to account for multiple payment streams and will result in the
ability to separately account for more deliverables, and potentially less
revenue deferrals. Additionally, Issue 08-1 requires enhanced disclosures in
financial statements. Issue 08-1 is effective for revenue arrangements enter
into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2010 on a

the impact this Issue will have on our financial statements.</P>
<P align=justify><B>3. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS </B></P>
<P align=justify>ASC 820 requires expanded disclosures about fair value
measurements. We adopted these provisions relating to assets and liabilities
recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring
basis on January 1, 2008. The adoption of these provisions did not have a
material effect on our consolidated financial statements. </P>
<P align=justify>ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price,
representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based
on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. As such, fair value is a
market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. ASC 820 requires
us to use valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are
prioritized as follows: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt"><B>Level 1: </B>Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical
  assets or liabilities in active markets
  <LI>

  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or market-corroborated
  inputs
  <LI><B>Level 3: </B>Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market
  data and which require us to develop our own assumptions about how market
  participants would price the assets or liabilities </LI></UL>

assets that were measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2009: </P>

<P align=justify><B>4. EARNINGS PER SHARE </B></P>
<P align=justify>Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased
to include all additional common shares that would have been outstanding
assuming potentially dilutive common shares, resulting from option exercises,
had been issued and any proceeds thereof used to repurchase common stock at the
average market price during the period. In periods in which there is a net loss,
potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted
earnings per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive.</P>

<P align=justify>In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the
Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of
deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income
during the periods in which the temporary differences representing net future
deductible amounts become deductible. Based on the Company's uncertainty of
anticipated future taxable income, the Company is keeping a full valuation
allowance for all its deferred tax assets. The Company&#146;s valuation allowance decreased by $255,664 primarily due to the
recognition of deferred revenue under the DFB and Auxilium Agreements and change
in estimate related to incentive stock options. </P>

<P align=justify>At December 31, 2009, we had federal tax return net operating
loss carry forwards of approximately $1.6 million, which will expire in 2029, if
not utilized. In addition, we had state tax return net operating loss carry
forwards of approximately $3.3 million related to New York State, which will
expire in 2027 through 2029 if not utilized. The recorded deferred tax asset
amount of $0.5 million for net operating losses shown in the above table is net
of windfall stock compensation deductions due to the disqualification of certain
stock option that were exercised and sold in 2009, which when realized, will be
recorded directly to additional paid-in capital in accordance with ASC

<P align=justify>The Company plans to apply $198,239 of its NOL deferred tax

NOL by $198,239. </P>

<P align=justify>As of December 31, 2009, the Company believes that there are no

<P align=justify><B>Stock Option Plans </B></P>
<P align=justify>In July 1997, the Company's stockholders approved a stock
option plan (the &#147;1997 Plan&#148;) for eligible key employees, directors, independent
agents, and consultants who make a significant contribution toward the Company's
success and development and to attract and retain qualified employees which
expired in July 2007. Under the 1997 Plan, qualified incentive stock options and
non-qualified stock options may be granted to purchase up to an aggregate of
500,000 shares of the Company's common stock, subject to certain anti-dilution
provisions. The exercise price per share of common stock may not be less than
100% (110% for qualified incentive stock options granted to stockholders owning
at least 10% of common shares) of the fair market value of the Company's common
stock on the date of grant. In general, the options vest and become exercisable
in four equal annual installments following the date of grant, although the
Board, at its discretion, may provide for different vesting schedules. The
options expire ten years (five years for qualified incentive stock options
granted to stockholders owning at least 10% of common shares) after such date.
In accordance with terms of the 1997 Plan, no options were granted ten years
after the effective date of the 1997 Plan, or July 2007. In July 2007,
approximately 231,000 stock options expired unissued, and there are no shares
available for grant remaining under the 1997 Plan. As of December 31, 2009 there
were 29,000 options outstanding under the 1997 Plan. </P>
<P align=justify>In August 2001, the Company's stockholders approved a stock
option plan (the &#147;2001 Plan&#148;), with terms similar to the 1997 Plan. The 2001
Plan authorizes the granting of awards of up to an aggregate of 750,000 shares
of the Company's common stock, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions. On
December 16, 2003, stockholders approved an amendment to the 2001 Plan, which
increased the number of shares authorized for grant from 750,000 shares to
1,750,000 shares, an increase of 1,000,000 shares. On June 17, 2009, our
stockholders approved an amendment to the 2001 Plan to extend the term of the
2001 Plan from April 6, 2011 to April 23, 2019 and to authorize an additional
300,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under the 2001 Plan. A total of
2,050,000 shares of common stock are now authorized for issuance under the
amended 2001 Plan. The Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-8 for
the 2001 Plan with the Commission on October 5, 2007 and on July 15, 2009 as
amended to register these securities. As of December 31, 2009 options to
purchase 1,464,850 shares of common stock were outstanding under the 1997 Plan
and 2001 Plan, and a total of 269,098 shares available for grant remaining under
the 2001 Plan. </P>

<P align=justify>The weighted-average grant-date fair value for options granted
during 2009 was $24.43 per share and $16.00 per share in 2008. During the 2009
and 2008, $380,029 and $255,388 were received from stock options exercised by
employees, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding
and exercisable as of December 31, 2009 was approximately $31.5 million.
Aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on
the closing price of our common stock of $32.01 on December 31, 2009, which
would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised
their options as of that date. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to
non-vested stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2009 was approximately
$1.9 million which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.2
years.</P>
<P align=justify>During 2009, the exercise of 114,000 stock options resulted in
a realized benefit of $1.1 million in tax return deductions, in excess of
compensation cost recognized and is accounted for as a reduction of the
Company&#146;s tax liability and an increase in additional paid-in capital.</P>
<P align=justify>Accounting Standards Codification 230, <I>Statement of Cash
Flows (&#147;ASC 230&#148;), </I>as amended, the realized tax benefit related to the
excess of the deductible amount over the compensation cost recognized is
classified as a cash inflow from financing activities and a cash outflow from
operating activities in the statement of cash flows. </P>

<P align=justify>As previously reported, ABC-NY (together with the Company, the
&#147;Tenant&#148;) and Wilbur St. Corp. (the &#147;Landlord&#148;), entered into a Commercial Lease
Agreement on January 30, 1998 (the &#147;Commercial Lease Agreement&#148;), pursuant to
which the Landlord leased to ABC the premises located at 35 Wilbur Street,
Lynbrook, NY 11563 (the &#147;Premises&#148;) for a term of 7 years or until January 31,
2005 and for an annual rental price of $125,000.</P>
<P align=justify>Also as previously reported, the Tenant, without the approval
of the board of directors of the Company, and the Landlord entered into an
Extension and Modification Agreement on July 1, 2005 (the &#147;Modification
Agreement&#148; and together with the Commercial Lease Agreement, the &#147;Lease
Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which the term of the Commercial Lease Agreement was
extended for an additional 5 years or until June 30, 2010 and the annual rental
price for the Premises increased to $150,000. </P>
<P align=justify>In connection with the settlement of the previously reported
dispute between the Tenant and the Landlord regarding payments of amounts due
under the Modification Agreement, the parties entered into a Lease Modification
Agreement dated June 22, 2009 and effective as of June 24, 2009 (the &#147;LMA&#148;).
Pursuant to the LMA, the Tenant ratified the Lease Agreement, including the
Modification Agreement, subject to the terms thereof, and agreed to a $15,000
reduction in the annual rental price of the Premises to $135,000. The Lease
Agreement expires on June 30, 2010. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Receivables and Deferred Revenue</B></P>
<P align=justify>Under the DFB Agreement, we agreed to provide certain technical
assistance and certain transition services to DFB in consideration of fees and
costs totaling over $1.4 million. At the closing of the DFB Agreement, DFB paid
to us a partial payment of $400,000 in respect of the technical assistance to be
provided by us. As of December 31, 2009, we have received a total of $1,200,000
in payments from DFB. The consulting obligations generally expire during March
2011. As of December 31, 2009, the remaining accounts receivable balance due was
$200,000 for future services and was offset by the associated deferred revenues
to be recognized in future periods of $200,000. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Potential Product Liability </B></P>
<P align=justify>The sale of our topical collaganese product, as well as the
development and marketing of any potential products of the Company, exposes us
to potential product liability claims both directly from patients using the
product or products in development, as well as from our agreement to indemnify
certain distributors of the product for claims made by others. We have product
liability insurance, which covers the use of our licensed topical collagenase
product and clinical experiments of potential products in the U.S. No known
claims are pending against us at the current time. Our insurance policy has a
limit of $3 million and is renewed annually during the month of February. </P>
