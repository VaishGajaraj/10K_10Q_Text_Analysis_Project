we have acquired and will acquire may not generate sufficient additional income to justify their
acquisition; possibilities that conditions to closing of certain transactions will not be
satisfied; our ability to close on facilities under non-binding letters of intent, which is
generally less probable than closing on facilities under definitive agreements; the possibilities
that changes in the capital markets, including changes in interest rates and/or credit spreads, or
other factors could make financing more expensive or unavailable to us; a decrease in the overall
demand for senior housing; general economic conditions and economic conditions in the markets in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, we are the third largest operator of senior living facilities in the
United States based on total capacity, with over 380 facilities in 31 states and the ability to
serve over 30,000 residents. We offer our residents access to a full continuum of services across
all sectors of the senior living industry. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, we operated 80 independent
living facilities with 14,439 units/beds, 295 assisted living facilities with 12,529 units/beds,
seven continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs, with 3,005 units/beds (including 817
resident-owned cottages on our CCRC campuses managed by us) and one skilled nursing facility with
82 units/beds. The majority of our units/beds are located in campus settings or facilities
containing multiple services, including CCRCs. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, our facilities were on
average 89.8% occupied. We generate over 96% of our revenues from private pay customers, which
limits our exposure to government reimbursement risk. In addition, we control all financial and
operational decisions regarding our facilities through property ownership and long-term leases. We
believe we operate in the most attractive sectors of the senior living industry with significant
opportunities to increase our revenues through providing a combination of housing, hospitality
services and health care services. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, 28.7% of our revenues were
generated from owned facilities, 70.8% from leased facilities and 0.5% from management fees from
facilities we operate on behalf of third parties and affiliates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were formed in June&nbsp;2005 for the purpose of combining two leading senior living operating
companies, Brookdale Living Communities, Inc., or BLC, and Alterra Healthcare Corporation, or
Alterra. BLC and Alterra have been operating independently since 1986 and 1981, respectively. Since
December&nbsp;2003, BLC and Alterra have been under the common control of Fortress Investment Group
(&#147;Fortress&#148; or &#147;FIG&#148;). Fortress owns 43,407,000 shares, or over 65%, of our common stock. On
November&nbsp;22, 2005, we completed our initial public offering of 12,732,800 shares of our common
stock, including 8,560,800 primary shares, at $19.00 per share, for which we received proceeds,
after fees and expenses, of approximately $144.8&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We plan to grow our revenue and operating income through a combination of: (i)&nbsp;organic growth
in our existing portfolio; (ii)&nbsp;acquisitions of additional operating companies and facilities; and
(iii)&nbsp;the realization of economies of scale, including those created by the BLC and Alterra
combination. Given the size and breadth of our nationwide platform, we believe that we are well
positioned to invest in a broad spectrum of assets in the senior living industry, including
independent living, assisted living, CCRC and skilled nursing assets. For the period January&nbsp;2001
through December&nbsp;31, 2005, we have begun leasing or acquired the ownership or management of 55
senior living facilities (not including those facilities we acquired and subsequently disposed of)
with approximately 10,900 units/beds. In 2005, prior to our initial public offering in November
2005, we acquired 15 senior living facilities with 4,077 units/beds (including 817 resident-owned
cottages on our CCRC campuses managed by us) and two additional facilities with an aggregate of 422
units/beds, which were sold in the third quarter of 2005, and one of which we continued to manage
to January&nbsp;2006. Since our initial public offering in November&nbsp;2005, we have purchased or has
committed to purchase $743&nbsp;million in senior housing assets representing 101 facilities (9,015
units/beds).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the senior living industry is the preferred alternative to meet the growing
demand for a cost-effective residential setting in which to care for the elderly who cannot, or as
a lifestyle choice choose not to, live independently due to physical or cognitive frailties and who
may, as a result, require assistance with some of the activities of daily living or the
availability of nursing or other medical care. Housing alternatives for seniors include a broad
spectrum of senior living service and care options, including independent living, assisted living,
memory care and skilled nursing care. More specifically, senior living consists of a combination of
housing and the availability of 24-hour a day personal support services and assistance with certain
activities of daily living.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a holding company formed in June&nbsp;2005 for the purpose of combining, through a series of
mergers, two leading senior living operating companies, BLC and Alterra, which have been operating
independently since 1986 and 1981, respectively. Fortress has been the majority owner of BLC since
September&nbsp;2000 and of Alterra since December&nbsp;2003. Fortress owns 43,407,000 shares, or over 65% of
our common stock. On November&nbsp;22, 2005, we completed our initial public offering of 12,732,800
shares of our common stock, including 8,560,800 primary shares, at $19.00 per share, for which we
received proceeds, after fees and expenses, of approximately $144.8&nbsp;million. In addition, prior to
our initial public offering, we acquired, through affiliates of Fortress, 15 additional senior
living facilities and two facilities which were sold in the third quarter of 2005, one of which we
continued to manage until January&nbsp;2006. In June and July&nbsp;2005, FIT REN purchased eight senior
living facilities and one senior living facility, respectively, consisting of 1,261 units/beds from
affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $282.4
million, before closing costs. In April&nbsp;2005, Fortress CCRC purchased eight senior living
facilities with 3,238 units/beds from The National Benevolent Association of the Christian Church
(Disciples of Christ), or the NBA, as debtor-in-possession under Chapter&nbsp;11 of the U.S. bankruptcy
code for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $181.4&nbsp;million, before closing costs. Of
these eight facilities, Fortress CCRC sold one on July&nbsp;1, 2005 for $2.5&nbsp;million, and one on
September&nbsp;14, 2005 for $9.0&nbsp;million, before closing costs. Subsequent to the acquisition of these
facilities by FIT REN and Fortress CCRC, the facilities were managed by affiliates of BLC. As
described below, we acquired ownership of the properties purchased by FIT REN and Fortress CCRC in
September&nbsp;2005 at a price equal to the purchase price for which each of FIT REN and Fortress CCRC
acquired the respective facilities. It is our intention to continue to own and manage the nine
facilities originally purchased by FIT REN and six facilities originally purchased by Fortress
CCRC. In September&nbsp;2005, the following series of transactions occurred:

Realty, Limited Partnership, or Ventas, for approximately $114.6&nbsp;million. Ventas also acquired
another facility from a third party in a separate transaction. Simultaneously with such sales,
wholly-owned subsidiaries of BLC, or the Ventas Tenants, entered into and became the tenants under
a master lease with Ventas pursuant to which the Ventas Tenants currently lease 13 facilities. Two
additional facilities are leased to the Ventas Tenants pursuant to individual leases substantially
similar to the master lease. BLC has guaranteed the leases for the full and prompt payment and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NBA is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization founded in 1887. As a result of
deteriorating operating performance and unsuccessful negotiations to restructure the NBA&#146;s debt and
management, bonds issued by the NBA were trading at a discount to their par value. Between January
and February&nbsp;2004, FIT CCRC LLC, an affiliate of Fortress, acquired the NBA debt and helped form
the unsecured creditors&#146; committee to lead a restructuring of the NBA. In February&nbsp;2004, the NBA
elected to file for bankruptcy protection. In September&nbsp;2004, Fortress CCRC negotiated an asset
purchase agreement to acquire 11 CCRC facilities consisting of 4,053 units/beds (including 817
resident-owned cottages or our CCRC campuses managed by us) across ten states from the NBA as
debtor in possession under Chapter&nbsp;11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code. Fortress CCRC was subsequently
selected as the winning bidder through a bankruptcy auction in December&nbsp;2004. In April and May
2005, Fortress CCRC purchased 11 of the facilities consisting of 4,053 units/beds (including 825
resident-owned cottages or our CCRC campuses managed by us) from the NBA for an aggregate purchase
price of approximately $210.5&nbsp;million, including closing costs and the assumption of $24.4&nbsp;million
of refundable entrance fees. Three of these facilities were sold by Fortress CCRC to other
purchasers for $30.3&nbsp;million simultaneously with or shortly after their purchase. Of the eight
facilities that remained, Fortress CCRC sold one on July&nbsp;1, 2005 for $2.5&nbsp;million and one on
September&nbsp;14, 2005 for $9.0&nbsp;million. It is our intention to retain ownership of the six remaining
facilities. We refer to these six facilities as the &#147;Fortress CCRC Portfolio.&#148; We plan to improve
the operation of the Fortress CCRC Portfolio, which we believe has been severely under-managed as a
result of significant turmoil at the NBA prior to and during the bankruptcy process.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seven reportable segments which we determined based on the way that management
organizes the segments within the enterprise for making operating decisions and assessing
performance. In addition, the management approach focuses on financial information that an
enterprise&#146;s decision makers use to make decisions about the enterprise&#146;s operating matters. We
continue to evaluate the type of financial information necessary for the decision makers as we
implement our growth strategies. Prior to formation on September&nbsp;30, 2005 and presently, each of
Brookdale Living Communities, Inc., the Fortress CCRC Portfolio and the Prudential Portfolio, and
Alterra, had and has distinct chief operating decision makers, or CODMS. Each of our facilities
are considered separate operating segments because they each engage in business activities from
which they earn revenues and incur expenses, their operating results are regularly reviewed by the
CODMS to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance,
and discrete financial information is available.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;131, <I>Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, </I>permits
aggregation of operating segments that share all common operating characteristics (similar products
and services, similar methods used to deliver or provide their products and services, and similar
type and class of customer for their products and services) and similar economic characteristics
(revenue recognition and gross margin). We believe that each of our facilities provides similar
services, delivers these services in a similar manner, and has common type and class of customer.
In addition, all of our facilities recognize and report revenue in a similar manner. However, our
individual facility gross margins vary significantly. Therefore, we have aggregated our segments
based upon the lowest common economic characteristic of each of our facilities: gross margin. The
CODMS allocate resources in large part based on margin and analyze each of the facilities as having
either (1)&nbsp;less than 20% operating margins, (2)&nbsp;more than 20% operating margins but less than 40%
operating margins, or (3)&nbsp;greater than 40% operating margins. The CODMS believe that the margin is
the primary, most significant and most useful indicator of the necessary allocation of resources to
each individual facility because it is the best indicator of a facility&#146;s operating performance and
resource requirements. Accordingly, our operating segments are aggregated into six reportable
segments based on comparable operating margins within each of Brookdale Living and Alterra. We
defined our operating margin for each group of facilities as that group&#146;s operating income divided
by its revenue. Operating income represents revenue less operating expenses (excluding
depreciation and amortization). See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included
herein on Item&nbsp;8.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also present a reportable segment for management services because the economic and
operating characteristics of these services are different from our facilities aggregated above.

them with a continuum of senior independent and assisted living services. While the number varies
depending upon the particular facility, 85% of all of the units at our Independent Living
Facilities are independent living units (of our facilities with both independent and assisted

specific facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Independent Living Facility provides residents with basic services such as meal service,
24-hour emergency response, housekeeping, concierge services, transportation and recreational
activities. Most of these facilities also offer custom tailored supplemental care services at an
additional charge under the &#147;Personally Yours&#148; program, which may include medication reminders,
check-in services and escort and companion services. Additional fees that we collect in connection
with our &#147;Personally Yours&#148; program vary by facility and range from $5 to $50 per service.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the basic services, our Independent Living Facilities that include assisted
living also provide residents with supplemental care services options to provide assistance with
ADLs. The levels of care provided to residents vary from facility to facility depending, among
other things, upon the licensing requirements of the state in which the facility is located.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents in these facilities are able to maintain their residency for an extended period of
time due to the range of service options available to residents (not including skilled nursing) as
their needs change. Residents with cognitive or physical frailties and higher level service needs
are accommodated with supplemental services in their own units or, in certain facilities, are cared
for in a more structured and supervised environment on a separate wing or floor. These facilities
also have a dedicated assisted living staff, including nurses at the majority of facilities, and
separate assisted living dining rooms and activity areas.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All residents at these facilities receive the basic care level, which includes ongoing health
assessments, three meals per day and snacks, coordination of special diets planned by a registered
dietitian, assistance with coordination of physician care, social and recreational activities,
housekeeping and personal laundry services. In some locations we offer our residents exercise
programs and programs designed to address issues associated with early stages of Alzheimer&#146;s and
other forms of dementia. In addition, we offer higher levels of personal care services to residents
at these facilities that are very physically frail or experiencing early stages of Alzheimer&#146;s
disease or other dementia and who require more frequent or intensive physical assistance or
increased personal care and supervision due to cognitive impairments. For example, physically frail
residents may require medication management, two-person transfer from a wheelchair or incontinence
care. These additional services, which we offer for an additional cost, are part of our &#147;YourCare&#148;

residents. To date, we have been able to increase our monthly resident fees each year and we have
generally experienced increasing facility operating margins through a combination of the
implementation of efficient operating procedures and the economies of scale associated with the
size and number of our facilities. Our operating procedures include securing national vendor
contracts to obtain the lowest possible pricing for certain services such as food, energy and
insurance, implementing strict budgeting and financial controls at each facility, and establishing
standardized training and operations procedures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also purchase annual insurance policies in the ordinary course of business for property,
auto, workers&#146; compensation and excess auto/employer liability and most recently purchased a
three-year general/professional liability policy, with a one-year excess general liability policy.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that successful senior living operators must effectively combine the business
disciplines of housing, hospitality, health care, marketing, finance and real estate expertise.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have implemented intensive standards, policies and procedures and systems, including
detailed staff manuals, which we believe have contributed to our facility operating margins. We
have centralized accounting controls, finance and other operating functions so that, consistent
with our operating philosophy, facility-based personnel can focus on resident care and efficient
operations. Staff in both our headquarters in Chicago, Illinois and at our operations support
center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin are responsible for the establishment of company-wide policies and
procedures relating to, among other things, resident care; facility design and facility operations;
billings and collections; accounts payable; finance and accounting; risk management; development of

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have developed a centralized infrastructure and services platform, which provides us with a
significant operational advantage over local and regional operators of senior living facilities.
The size of our business also allows us to achieve increased efficiencies with respect to various
corporate functions such as human resources, finance, accounting, legal, information technology and
marketing. We are also able to realize cost efficiencies in the purchasing of food, supplies,
insurance, benefits, and other goods and services. In addition, we have established an operations
group to support all of our product lines and facilities in areas such as training, regulatory
affairs, asset management, dining and procurement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Facility Staffing and Training</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each facility has an Executive Director or Residence Director, each a Director, responsible
for the overall day-to-day operations of the facility, including quality of care, social services
and financial performance. Each Director receives specialized training from us. In addition, a
portion of each Director&#146;s compensation is directly tied to the operating performance of the
facility and to the maintenance of high occupancy levels. We believe that the quality of our
facilities, coupled with our competitive compensation philosophy, has enabled us to attract
high-quality, professional Directors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending upon the size of the facility, each Director is supported by a facility staff member
who is directly responsible for day-to-day care of the residents and either facility staff or
regional support to oversee the facility&#146;s marketing and community outreach programs. Other key
positions supporting each facility may include individuals responsible for food service,
activities, housekeeping, and engineering.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that quality of care and operating efficiency can be maximized by direct resident
and staff contact. Employees involved in resident care, including the administrative staff, are
trained in the support and care needs of the residents and emergency response techniques. We have
adopted formal training and evaluation procedures to help ensure quality care for our residents. We
have extensive policy and procedure manuals and hold frequent training sessions for management and
staff at each site.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Quality Assurance</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We maintain quality assurance programs at each of our facilities through our corporate staff.
Our quality assurance program is designed to achieve a high degree of resident and family member
satisfaction with the care and services that we provide. Our quality control measures include,
among other things, facility inspections conducted by corporate staff on a regular basis. These
inspections cover the appearance of the exterior and grounds; the appearance and cleanliness of the
interior; the professionalism and friendliness of staff; resident care; the quality of activities
and the dining program; observance of residents in their daily living activities; and compliance
with government regulations. Our quality control measures also include the survey of residents and
family members on a regular basis to monitor their perception of the quality of services provided
to residents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to foster a sense of community as well as to respond to residents&#146; desires, at our
facilities, we have established a resident council or other resident advisory committee that meets
monthly with the Director of the facility. Separate resident committees also exist at many of these
facilities for food service, activities, marketing and hospitality. These committees promote
resident involvement and satisfaction and enable facility management to be more responsive to the
residents&#146; needs and desires.

and monitors the success of our marketing efforts, including outreach programs. In addition to
direct contacts with prospective referral sources, we also rely on print advertising, yellow pages

Certain resident referral programs have been established and promoted within the limitations of
federal and state laws at many facilities.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior living industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous other companies
that provide similar senior living alternatives, such as home health care agencies, community-based
service programs, retirement communities, convalescent centers and other senior living providers.
In general, regulatory and other barriers to competitive entry in the independent living and
assisted living segments of the senior living industry are not substantial, except in the skilled
nursing segment. Although new construction of senior living communities has declined in recent
years, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience competition in our efforts to
acquire and operate senior living facilities. Some of our present and potential senior living
competitors have, or may obtain, greater financial resources than us and may have a lower cost of
capital. Consequently, we may encounter competition that could limit our ability to attract
residents or expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and
earnings. Our major competitors are Sunrise Senior Living, Inc., Colson &#038; Colson/Holiday Retirement
Corp., American Retirement Corporation, Professional Community Management Life Care Services, LLC
and Atria Senior Living Group.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our target independent living residents are senior citizens age 70 and older who desire or
need a more supportive living environment. The average independent living resident resides in an
independent living facility for 30&nbsp;months. A number of our independent living residents relocate to
one of our facilities in order to be in a metropolitan area that is closer to their adult children.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our target assisted living residents are predominantly female senior citizens age 85 and older
who require daily assistance with two or three ADLs. The average assisted living resident resides
in an assisted living facility for 22&nbsp;months. Residents typically enter an assisted living facility
due to a relatively immediate need for services that might have been triggered by a medical event
or need.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe our combination of independent and assisted living operating expertise and the
broad base of customers that this enables us to target creates a unique opportunity for us to
invest in a broad spectrum of assets in the senior living industry, including independent living,
assisted living, CCRC and skilled nursing assets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulatory environment surrounding the senior living industry continues to intensify in
the amount and type of laws and regulations affecting it. In addition, federal, state and local
officials are increasingly focusing their efforts on enforcement of these laws. This is
particularly true for large for-profit, multi-facility providers like us. Some of the laws and
regulations that impact our industry include: state and local laws impacting licensure, protecting
consumers against deceptive practices, and generally affecting the facilities&#146; management of
property and equipment and how we otherwise conduct our operations, such as fire, health and safety
laws and regulations and privacy laws, federal and state laws designed to protect Medicare and
Medicaid, which mandate what are allowable costs, pricing, quality of services, quality of care,

statutes and regulations; Anti-Kickback and physicians referral (&#147;Stark&#148;) laws; and safety and
health standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. We are unable to predict
the future course of federal, state and local legislation or regulation. Changes in the regulatory
framework could have a material adverse effect on our business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many senior living facilities are also subject to regulation and licensing by state and local
health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities. Although requirements vary
from state to state, these requirements may address, among others, the following: personnel
education, training and records; facility services, including administration of medication,
assistance with self-administration of medication and the provision of nursing services; staffing
levels; monitoring of resident wellness; physical plant specifications; furnishing of resident
units; food and housekeeping services; emergency evacuation plans; professional licensing and
certification of staff prior to beginning employment; and resident rights and responsibilities,
including in some states the right to receive health care services from providers of a resident&#146;s
choice that are not our employees. In several of the states in which we operate or may operate, we
are prohibited from providing certain higher levels of senior care services without first obtaining
the appropriate licenses. In addition, in several of the states in which we operate or intend to
operate, assisted living facilities and/or skilled nursing facilities require a certificate of need
before the facility can be opened or the services at an existing facility can be expanded. Senior
living facilities may also be subject to state and/or local building, zoning, fire and food service
codes and must be in compliance with these local codes before licensing or certification may be
granted. These laws and regulatory requirements could affect our ability to expand into new markets
and to expand our services and facilities in existing markets. In addition, if any of our presently
licensed facilities operates outside of its licensing authority, it may be subject to penalties,
including closure of the facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intensified regulatory and enforcement environment impacts providers like us because of
the increase in the number of inspections or surveys by governmental authorities and consequent
citations for failure to comply with regulatory requirements. Unannounced surveys or inspections
may occur annually or bi-annually, or following a state&#146;s receipt of a complaint about the
facility. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive deficiency reports from
state regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections or surveys. Most inspection deficiencies
are resolved through an agreed-to plan of corrective action relating to the facility&#146;s operations,
but the reviewing agency typically has the authority to take further action against a licensed or
certified facility, which could result in the imposition of fines, imposition of a provisional or
conditional license, suspension or revocation of a license, suspension or denial of admissions,
loss of certification as a provider under federal health care programs or imposition of other
sanctions, including criminal penalties. Loss, suspension or modification of a license may also
cause us to default under our leases and/or trigger cross-defaults. Sanctions may be taken against
providers or facilities without regard to the providers&#146; or facilities&#146; history of compliance. We
may also expend considerable resources to respond to federal and state investigations or other
enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. To date, none of the deficiency reports
received by us has resulted in a suspension, fine or other disposition that has had a material
adverse effect on our revenues. However, any future substantial failure to comply with any
applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result in a material adverse effect to our
business as a whole. In addition, state Attorneys General vigorously enforce consumer protection
laws as those laws relate to the senior living industry. State Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Units may
investigate assisted living facilities even if the facility or any of its residents do not receive
federal or state funds.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulation of the senior living industry is evolving at least partly because of the growing
interests of a variety of advocacy organizations and political movements attempting to standardize
regulations for certain segments of the industry, particularly assisted living. Our operations
could suffer if future regulatory developments, such as federal assisted living laws and
regulations, as well as mandatory increases in the scope and severity of deficiencies determined by
survey or inspection officials, increase the number of citations that can result in civil or
criminal penalties. Certain current state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make
determinations on whether the care provided by one or more of our facilities exceeds the level of
care for which the facility is licensed. A finding that a facility is delivering care beyond its
license might result in the immediate transfer and discharge of residents, which may create market
instability and other adverse consequences. Furthermore, certain states may allow citations in one
facility to impact other facilities in the state. Revocation of a license at a given facility could
therefore impact our

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">ability to obtain new licenses or to renew existing licenses at other facilities, which may
also cause us to be in default under our leases and trigger cross-defaults or may also trigger
defaults under certain of our credit agreements, or adversely affect our ability to operate and/or
obtain financing in the future. If a state were to find that one facility&#146;s citation will impact
another of our facilities, this will also increase costs and result in increased surveillance by
the state survey agency. If regulatory requirements increase, whether through enactment of new laws
or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing rules, including increased enforcement
brought about by advocacy groups, in addition to federal and state regulators, our operations could
be adversely affected. In addition, any adverse finding by survey and inspection officials may
serve as the basis for false claims lawsuits by private plaintiffs and may lead to investigations
under federal and state laws, which may result in civil and/or criminal penalties against the
facility or individual.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various extremely complex federal and state laws governing a wide array of
referrals, relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by health care providers, including
those in the senior living industry, and governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention
and resources to such anti-fraud initiatives. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 expanded the penalties for health care
fraud. In addition, with respect to our participation in federal health care reimbursement
programs, the government or private individuals acting on behalf of the government may bring an
action under the False Claims Act alleging that a health care provider has defrauded the government
and seek treble damages for false claims and the payment of additional monetary civil penalties.
Recently, other health care providers have faced enforcement action under the False Claims Act. The
False Claims Act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of
the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government&#146;s recovery. Because of these
incentives, so-called &#147;whistleblower&#148; suits have become more frequent. Also, if any of our
facilities exceeds its level of care, we may be subject to private lawsuits alleging &#147;transfer
trauma&#148; by residents. Such allegations could also lead to investigations by enforcement officials,
which could result in penalties, including the closure of facilities. The violation of any of these
regulations may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties that could jeopardize our
business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, in several states, we operate facilities that participate in federal and/or
state health care reimbursement programs, including state Medicaid waiver programs for assisted
living facilities and the Medicare skilled nursing facility benefit program, or other federal
and/or state health care programs. Consequently, we are subject to federal and state laws that
prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for reimbursement which are
false, fraudulent or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Similar state
laws vary from state to state and we cannot be sure that these laws will interpret consistently or
in keeping with past practices. Violation of any of these laws can result in loss of licensure,
civil or criminal penalties and exclusion of health care providers or suppliers from furnishing
covered items or services to beneficiaries of the applicable federal and/or state health care
reimbursement program. Loss of licensure may also cause us to default under our leases and/or
trigger cross-defaults.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also subject to certain federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements by
health care providers, such as the Federal Anti-Kickback Law, the Stark laws and certain state
referral laws. The Federal Anti-Kickback Law makes it unlawful for any person to offer or pay (or
to solicit or receive) &#147;any remuneration ... directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash
or in kind&#148; for referring or recommending for purchase any item or service which is eligible for
payment under the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs. Authorities have interpreted this statute very
broadly to apply to many practices and relationships between health care providers and sources of
patient referral. If a health care provider were to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback Law, it may
face criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and possible exclusion from government
programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, which may also cause us to default under our leases and/or
trigger cross-defaults. Adverse consequences may also result if we violate federal Stark laws
related to certain Medicare and Medicaid physician referrals. While we endeavor to comply with all
laws that regulate the licensure and operation of our senior living communities, it is difficult to
predict how our revenues could be affected if we were subject to an action alleging such
violations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also subject to federal and state laws designed to protect the confidentiality of
patient health information. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued
rules pursuant to HIPAA relating to the privacy of such information. Rules that became effective
April&nbsp;14, 2003 govern our use and disclosure of health information at certain HIPAA covered
facilities. We established procedures to

compliance with the HIPAA rule establishing administrative, physical and technical security
standards for health information by April&nbsp;2005. To the best of our knowledge, we are in compliance
with this rule. Although both current and pending HIPAA requirements affect the manner in which we
handle health data and communicate with payors at covered facilities, we believe that the cost of
compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Environmental Matters</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or
operator of real property, such as us, may be held liable in certain circumstances for the costs of
investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances, including, among
others, petroleum and materials containing asbestos, that could be located on, in, at or under a
property, regardless of how such materials came to be located there. Additionally, such an owner or
operator of real property may incur costs relating to the release of hazardous or toxic substances,
including government fines and payments for personal injuries or damage to adjacent property. The
cost of any required investigation remediation, removal, mitigation, compliance, fines or personal
or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the property&#146;s value and/or our
assets&#146; value. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of
or remediate the damage caused by such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell such
property, to attract additional residents and retain existing residents, to borrow using such
property as collateral or to develop or redevelop such property. In addition, such laws impose
liability for investigation, remediation, removal and mitigation costs on persons who disposed of
or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at third-party sites. Such laws and
regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was
responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of such substances as well as without regard to
whether such release or disposal was in compliance with law at the time it occurred. Moreover, the
imposition of such liability upon us could be joint and several, which means we could be required
to pay for the cost of cleaning up contamination caused by others who have become insolvent or
otherwise judgment proof.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not believe that we have incurred such liabilities as would have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state and local environmental
laws, including those relating to: the handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of
medical waste products generated at our facilities; identification and warning of the presence of
asbestos-containing materials in buildings, as well as removal of such materials; the presence of
other substances in the indoor environment, and protection of the environment and natural resources
in connection with development or construction of our properties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our facilities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness
or physical condition of the residents, including, for example, blood-soaked bandages, swabs and
other medical waste products and incontinence products of those residents diagnosed with an
infectious disease. The management of infectious medical waste, including its handling, storage,
transportation, treatment and disposal, is subject to regulation under various federal, state and
local environmental laws. These environmental laws set forth the management requirements for such
waste, as well as related permit, record-keeping, notice and reporting obligations. Each of our
facilities has an agreement with a waste management company for the proper disposal of all
infectious medical waste. The use of such waste management companies does not immunize us from
alleged violations of such medical waste laws for operations for which we are responsible even if
carried out by such waste management companies, nor does it immunize us from third-party claims for
the cost to cleanup disposal sites at which such wastes have been disposed. Any finding that we are
not in compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our business operations and
financial condition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building&#146;s
management to identify and warn, via signs and labels, their employees and certain other employers

the presence of mold, lead-based paint, contaminants in drinking water, radon and/or other

Holdings shall deposit with PSLT-ALS Holdings as security for the performance of the terms,
conditions and provisions of the Alterra/Provident Agreement Regarding Leases and the
Alterra/Provident Property Leases, 50% of excess cash flow for the prior calendar quarter, until
such time as the amount held as the security deposit is equal to $10&nbsp;million. At ALS Holdings&#146;
option, ALS Holdings may post letters of credit in such amounts in lieu of depositing a cash
security deposit. For the foregoing purposes, excess cash flow will be computed by taking the net
operating income for all of the Alterra/Provident Properties and subtracting the Alterra/Provident
Base Rent payable in the aggregate under all of the Alterra/Provident Property Leases. If the
Alterra/Provident Properties achieve and maintain a lease coverage ratio of at least 1.15 to 1.00
for two consecutive six month periods, then the security deposit will be returned to ALS Holdings.
For the foregoing purposes, the lease coverage ratio will be computed by taking the net operating
income for all of the Alterra/Provident Properties (subject to certain adjustments), and dividing
it by the applicable Alterra/Provident Base Rent payable in the aggregate under all of the
Alterra/Provident Property Leases.

events, including if any Alterra/Provident Tenant fails to make a rental payment under the
Provident/Alterra Master Lease and ALS Holdings fails to make rental payments under the Agreement
Regarding Leases and the failure goes uncured for more than 30&nbsp;days, if an event of default has
occurred and remains uncured under any of the Alterra/Provident Property Leases or under the
Alterra/Provident Agreement Regarding Leases, or if the Alterra operator becomes bankrupt or
insolvent, has bankruptcy proceedings filed against it or voluntarily files for bankruptcy. In
addition, PSLT-ALS Holdings may cause to be terminated the Alterra/Provident Sublease Agreements if
the Alterra/Provident Properties fail to maintain on a quarterly basis a lease coverage ratio
(measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis) of at least 1.05 to 1.00 during any of the
first through third lease years, and at least 1.10 to 1.00 during any of the fourth through
fifteenth lease years and during each renewal term. ALS Holdings or the Alterra operator has the
right to cure a failure to maintain the required lease coverage ratio by posting cash or a letter
of credit in an amount sufficient to decrease, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the aggregate
applicable Alterra/Provident Base Rent reflected in the denominator of the lease coverage ratio
calculation to the extent necessary to be within compliance. This cure option may only be exercised
two times during the first through tenth years of the initial term. If PSLT-ALS Holdings terminates
any Alterra/Provident Sublease Agreement and replaces the Alterra operator with a manager or
operator other than an affiliate of Alterra, the Alterra/Provident Tenant has the right to
terminate the Alterra/Provident Property Lease with respect to the facility to which such
Alterra/Provident Sublease Agreement has been terminated. If PSLT-ALS Holdings terminates one or
more of the Alterra/Provident Management Agreements but the Alterra/Provident Tenants for such
applicable Alterra/Provident Properties do not terminate the applicable Alterra/Provident Property
Leases with respect to the applicable facilities, the Alterra/Provident Tenant will enter into a

However, the sale of 50% or more of Alterra&#146;s outstanding stock by its stockholders, or the sale of

to pay base rent in an amount equal to the BLC/Provident Lease Rate (as defined below) multiplied
by the sum of the purchase price (including certain transaction costs incurred in connection with
the BLC/Provident Sale which, at BLC&#146;s election, Provident actually paid (including financing costs

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial lease rate for the first year of each BLC/Provident Property Lease is 8.1%, or the
BLC/Provident Lease Rate. Commencing on January&nbsp;1, 2006, and annually thereafter, the BLC/Provident
Lease Rate will be increased, as the same may be escalated, the BLC/Provident Annual Increase, by
an amount equal to the lesser of (i)&nbsp;four times the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index
during the immediately preceding year or (ii)&nbsp;3%. During the first year of each renewal term of the
BLC/Provident Property Leases, (a)&nbsp;the BLC/Provident Lease Rate will be adjusted to equal the
greater of (i)&nbsp;the then current fair market BLC/Provident Lease Rate (as determined by mutual
agreement, or if no such agreement is
reached, by an acceptable appraisal method) or (ii)&nbsp;the prior year&#146;s BLC/Provident Lease Rate

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, base rent will be increased or decreased by a &#147;floating adjustment&#148; tied to
fluctuations in Provident&#146;s floating rate-based mortgage indebtedness. The floating adjustment is
an amount computed monthly equal to the increase or decrease in the applicable index (LIBOR, Prime
or BMA) from a base value multiplied by the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all floating
rate mortgages encumbering the BLC/Provident Properties (i.e., the dollar amount of the
BLC/Provident Floating Rate Debt (as defined below) assumed by Provident at the inception of the
BLC/Provident Property Leases, plus any additional amounts related to any refinancing advanced by
Provident to the BLC/Provident Tenants pursuant to the terms of the BLC/Provident Property Leases
and the BLC/Provident Agreement Regarding Leases) other than from refinancings under which BLC
Holdings has not elected to receive any proceeds, or the BLC/Provident Floating Rate Debt. Rent
under the BLC/Provident Property Leases will continue to be escalated in accordance with the
BLC/Provident Annual Increase and the floating adjustment during each renewal term; provided,
however, that with respect to any floating rate mortgages, the floating adjustment will apply only
through the maturity date of any underlying BLC/Provident Floating Rate Debt encumbering the
BLC/Provident Property at the commencement date of the respective BLC/Provident Property Lease and

Provided there is no event of default under the BLC/Provident Agreement Regarding Leases, BLC

BLC/Provident Tenants&#146; to reimburse them for the expenditure requirement under each of the
BLC/Provident Property Leases with respect to capital improvements of $450 per unit per year (in
the aggregate) among the BLC/Provident Properties, up to a maximum amount of $600 per unit per
year. If the BLC/Provident Properties achieve and maintain a lease coverage ratio of at least 1.10

returned to BLC Holdings. If the BLC/Provident Properties achieve and maintain a lease coverage
ratio of at least 1.15 to 1.00 for a consecutive twelve month period, then $15.0&nbsp;million of the
security deposit will be returned to BLC Holdings. Any balance of the security deposit will be
returned to BLC Holdings if the BLC/Provident Properties achieve and maintain a lease coverage
ratio of at least 1.20 to 1.00 for twelve consecutive months. For the foregoing purposes, the lease
coverage ratio will be computed by taking the net operating income for all of the BLC/Provident
Properties (subject to certain adjustments, including reductions for management fees and capital
expenditure requirements), and dividing it by base rent payable and Additional Debt Service Costs

if any BLC/Provident Tenant fails to make a rental payment and the failure goes uncured for more
than 30&nbsp;days, if an event of default has occurred and remains uncured under any of the
BLC/Provident Property Leases or under the BLC/Provident Agreement Regarding Leases, or if the
Brookdale manager becomes bankrupt or insolvent, has bankruptcy proceedings filed against it or
voluntarily files for bankruptcy. In addition, PSLT-BLC Holdings may terminate the BLC/Provident
Management Agreements if the BLC/Provident Properties fail to maintain on a quarterly basis a lease
coverage ratio (subject to certain adjustments) of at least 1.05 to 1.00 from January&nbsp;1, 2009

by posting cash or a letter of credit in an amount sufficient to increase on a dollar-for- dollar
basis the net operating income reflected in the numerator of the lease coverage ratio calculation
to the extent necessary to be within compliance. This cure option is available through December&nbsp;31,

offer to purchase any of the properties leased to BLC that Provident seeks to accept, Provident
will notify BLC of the offer and BLC has five days from receipt of the notice of proposed sale to
notify Provident of its election to purchase all but not less than all of the property or
properties that are the subject of said notice (or ownership interests in the applicable

purchase price within three business days of the BLC/Provident Purchase Notice and to close on the
purchase of the properties within 60&nbsp;days following the BLC/Provident Purchase Notice. In the event
BLC does not give
notice that it wishes to acquire the properties in question, or pay the deposit or close on
the properties within these time frames, the right of first refusal is deemed waived with regard to
the proposed sale. Further, if BLC gives the BLC/Provident Purchase Notice and pays the deposit,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HCR Master Lease is for an initial term that expires March&nbsp;19, 2017. Alterra has one
fifteen-year renewal option.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the HCR Master Lease, Alterra is obligated to pay monthly base rent, as the
same may be increased from time to time, the HCR Base Rent, based upon the aggregate amount of any
funds advanced by HCR to Alterra pursuant to the terms of the HCR Master Lease (approximately $81.7
million as of time of execution of the HCR Master Lease; subject to adjustment as properties are or
have been added to or removed from the portfolio) multiplied by 10.72%. HCR Base Rent increases
annually to an amount equal to the HCR Base Rent for the prior year plus the lesser of (i)&nbsp;the
maximum rent adjustment (which is equal to the prior year&#146;s HCR Base Rent multiplied by 1.025) and
(ii)&nbsp;an amount determined by multiplying the prior year&#146;s HCR Base Rent by the increase in the
consumer price index. If any annual adjustment based on the increase in the consumer price index is
in excess of the maximum rent adjustment, then the excess is applied to previous years in which the
increase was less than the maximum rent adjustment. The current rent payable under the HCR Master
Lease is approximately $13.5&nbsp;million. The rent payable under the HCR Master Lease is a net rent
payable to HCR, with Alterra responsible for the payment of all taxes, assessments, utility
expenses, insurance premiums and other expenses relating to the operation of the HCR Properties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alterra has the option to purchase the HCR Properties upon notice given during the last six
months of the initial term or renewal term, with an option price equal to the greater of (i)&nbsp;any
funds advanced by HCR to Alterra pursuant to the terms of the HCR Master Lease, including the
initial lease advance of approximately $81.7&nbsp;million, as the same may be adjusted as properties are
or have been added to or removed from the portfolio and (ii)&nbsp;the fair market value of the HCR
Properties at the time of the exercise of the option.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alterra is required to maintain a letter of credit with HCR as a security deposit for the
performance of Alterra&#146;s obligations under the HCR Master Lease. The letter of credit currently
held by HCR is approximately $1.1&nbsp;million provided such amount may be increased to reflect any
additional amounts advanced to Alterra by HCR. Alterra&#146;s obligation to maintain the letter of
credit terminates if the portfolio coverage ratio (the ratio of (i)&nbsp;portfolio cash flow to (ii)&nbsp;the
rent payments under the HCR Master Lease and all other debt service and lease payments relating to
the HCR Properties) equals or exceeds 1.75:1.00 for four

Alterra seeks to effect a merger, consolidation, or other structural change without HCR&#146;s consent,
then Alterra must have a net worth (calculated in accordance with GAAP) of $50.0&nbsp;million
immediately following such transaction.

year thereafter. Alterra must also maintain available working capital per property in the amount of
$100,000. Failure to comply with the aforementioned financial covenants will not constitute an
event of default unless such failure negatively affects 5% or more of the total beds at the HCR
Properties. If the failure affects less than 5% of total beds at the HCR Properties, then Alterra
shall have 90&nbsp;days after the occurrence of the potential event of default to cure such failure to
comply with the financial covenant. If such potential event of default is not cured within the 90
day period, then Alterra is obligated within 12&nbsp;months thereafter to either (i)&nbsp;provide a
substitute property for that portion of the HCR Properties that caused the potential event of
default, which substitute property must satisfy all of HCR&#146;s underwriting requirements, or (ii)
acquire that portion of the HCR Property which caused the potential event of default at a price
equal to the greater of (a)&nbsp;the fair market value of such HCR Property and (b)&nbsp;the allocated lease
amount for the HCR Property plus 10% of the allocated lease amount. A loss of licensure or a bed

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2002, Alterra entered into a single master lease, or the NHP Master Lease, with NHP
and its affiliates with respect to 57 facilities which included six facilities that were previously
leased by Alterra from Meditrust. Of the entire original NHP-Alterra portfolio, six additional
facilities were not included in the master lease due to underlying ground leases or bond related
indebtedness, and Alterra is obligated to amend the master lease to add such facilities when
consents are obtained. One of the six facilities was added to the NHP Master Lease in June&nbsp;2005.
Since the time of entry into the master lease, six facilities have been sold. As a result, 52
facilities, or the NHP Properties, remain under the master lease. The Company has guaranteed the
payment and performance of all of Alterra&#146;s obligations under the NHP Lease. Alterra is required to
maintain unrestricted cash and/or availability under lines of credit or revolving loan agreements

fund the cost of capital improvements at the NHP Properties within three years of April&nbsp;9, 2002, as
described in the NHP Master Lease, up to $4.0&nbsp;million, or the CapEx Funds. To date, approximately
$1.8&nbsp;million of the CapEx Funds have been funded. The rental increase would be the product of (a)
the amount of such CapEx Funds disbursed, and (b)&nbsp;a percentage equal to the greater of (i)&nbsp;11.5%
per annum and (ii)&nbsp;NHP&#146;s then market lease rate, not to exceed 13% per annum. In addition, Alterra
is obligated to pay, on a quarterly basis, additional rent, as the same may be increased from time
to time, the NHP Additional Rent, and together with the NHP Base Rent, collectively, the NHP Rent,
in an amount equal to 16% of the amount by which gross revenues of the NHP Properties for the
applicable quarter exceed one-fourth of the gross revenues of the NHP Properties for the 2002

Renewal Term where the increase in the NHP Rent shall not exceed 15% of the prior year. To the

excess over 2.7% is carried forward and applied to future years in which the rent increases for
such year would be below such capped amount. To the extent that the increase in the NHP Rent in the

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Risks Related to Our Business</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Our operating businesses were recently transferred to us, we have a limited operating history on a
combined basis, and we are therefore subject to the risks generally associated with the formation
of any new business and the combination of existing businesses.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2005, we were formed for the purpose of combining two leading senior living operating
companies, BLC and Alterra, through a series of mergers that occurred in September&nbsp;2005. Prior to
this combination, we had no operations or assets. We are therefore subject to the risks generally
associated with the formation of any new business and the combination of existing businesses,
including the risk that we will not be able to realize expected efficiencies and economies of scale
or implement our business strategies. As such, we have no meaningful combined and consolidated
operating history upon which investors may evaluate our performance as an integrated entity and
assess our future prospects. In addition, in 2005 prior to our initial public offering we acquired
15 additional senior living facilities and two additional facilities that were sold in the third
quarter of 2005, one of which we continued to manage until January&nbsp;2006. Since our initial public
offering, we have purchased or have entered into definitive agreements to purchase $743&nbsp;million in
senior housing assets, representing 101 facilities (9,015 units/beds). See &#147;Business &#151; History.&#148;
There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate and oversee the combined
operations of BLC and Alterra and these additional facilities. Accordingly, our financial
performance to date may not be indicative of our long-term future performance and may not
necessarily reflect what our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would have
been had we not operated as separate, stand-alone entities pursuing independent strategies during
the periods presented. Failure to successfully integrate our operations could have a material
adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and growth prospects.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>We have a history of losses and one of our operating subsidiaries, Alterra Healthcare Corporation,
emerged from Chapter&nbsp;11 bankruptcy reorganization in December&nbsp;2003; therefore, we may not be able
to achieve profitability.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We incurred net losses of approximately $24.5&nbsp;million for three months ended December&nbsp;31, 2005
and approximately $26.5&nbsp;million for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2005 and approximately $9.8
million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004. In addition, Alterra emerged from Chapter&nbsp;11
bankruptcy reorganization in December&nbsp;2003, approximately 11&nbsp;months after filing a voluntary
petition for bankruptcy reorganization, pursuant to which it sought to facilitate and complete its
ongoing restructuring initiatives. Prior to its reorganization, Alterra&#146;s overall cash position had
declined to a level that it believed to be insufficient to operate the company. This resulted in
its failure to make certain scheduled debt service and lease payments, which caused it to be in
default under several of its principal financing arrangements. The principal components of
Alterra&#146;s restructuring plan were to dispose of selected under-performing and non-strategic assets
and to restructure its capital structure. Alterra emerged from bankruptcy in December&nbsp;2003 when it
was acquired and recapitalized by FEBC-ALT Investors. In connection with its reorganization,
Alterra adopted fresh start accounting as of December&nbsp;4, 2003. Given our history of losses and
Alterra&#146;s recent emergence from bankruptcy, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
achieve and/or maintain profitability in the future. If we do not effectively manage our cash flow
and combined business operations going forward or otherwise achieve profitability, our ability to
pay dividends to our stockholders and our stock price would be adversely affected.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>You may not be able to compare our historical financial information to our current financial
information, which will make it more difficult to evaluate an investment in our common stock.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of Alterra&#146;s emergence from bankruptcy, we are operating a portion of our business
with a new capital structure and fewer properties and have adopted fresh start accounting
prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, unlike companies that have not
previously filed for bankruptcy protection, a portion of our financial condition and results of
operations are not comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in
Alterra&#146;s historical financial statements for periods prior to December&nbsp;4, 2003 contained in Item&nbsp;8
of this Annual Report. Without historical financial statements to

operating lease payments, this would result in defaults of the related debt or operating leases and
cross-defaults under other debt or operating leases, which would adversely affect our ability to
continue to generate income.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2005, we had $754.3&nbsp;million of outstanding indebtedness, bearing interest at a
weighted-average rate of 6.99%, including $66.3&nbsp;million of capital and financing lease obligations.
In connection with our announced acquisitions, we expect to incur
approximately $269.4&nbsp;million of
new indebtedness. We intend to continue financing our facilities through mortgage financing,
long-term operating leases and other types of financing, including borrowings under our lines of
credit and future credit facilities we may obtain. We cannot give any assurance that we will
generate sufficient cash flow from operations to cover required interest, principal and lease
payments. Any non-payment or other default under our financing arrangements could, subject to cure
provisions, cause the lender to foreclose upon the facility or facilities securing such
indebtedness or, in the case of a lease, cause the lessor to terminate the lease, each with a
consequent loss of income and asset value to us. Furthermore, in some cases, indebtedness is
secured by both a mortgage on a facility (or facilities) and a guaranty by us, BLC and/or Alterra.
In the event of a default under one of these scenarios, the lender could avoid judicial procedures
required to foreclose on real property by declaring all amounts outstanding under the guaranty
immediately due and payable, and requiring the respective guarantor to fulfill its obligations to
make such payments. The realization of any of these scenarios would have an adverse effect on our
financial condition and capital structure. Additionally, a foreclosure on any of our properties
could cause us to recognize taxable income, even if we did not receive any cash proceeds in
connection with such foreclosure. Further, because our mortgages and operating leases generally
contain cross-default and cross-collateralization provisions, a default by us related to one
facility could affect a significant number of facilities and their corresponding financing
arrangements and operating leases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as of December&nbsp;31, 2005, our lessors have invested a total of $1,705.6&nbsp;million,
which includes capital and financing leases of $66.3&nbsp;million, in facilities that we lease from
them. Lease financing transactions carry an inherently higher level of leverage than debt
financings, since typically the lessor finances 100% of the cost of a facility as compared to
traditional mortgage financings, which typically are financed with leverage of 65% to 75% of the
cost of a facility. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, our overall lease coverage in our leased
portfolio was 1.32:1.00 (measuring coverage before capital spending reserves and central management
costs). Certain of our leases require minimum lease coverage ratios as defined in the applicable
agreement. The failure to comply would result in a default under such leases, subject to cure
provisions. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, we were in compliance with all of our lease coverage
calculations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to make lease
payments on our operating leases depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to
general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting
our operations, many of which are beyond our control. Our business might not continue to generate
cash flow at or above current levels. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations in the future to service our debt or to make lease payments on our operating leases, we
may be required, among other things, to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets,
refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell selected assets, reduce or
delay planned capital expenditures or delay or abandon desirable acquisitions. Such measures might
not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to make lease payments on our operating
leases. The failure to make required payments on our debt or operating leases or the delay or
abandonment of our planned growth strategy could result in an adverse effect on our future ability
to generate revenues and sustain profitability. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or
sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms to us.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Our existing credit facilities, mortgage loans and sale-leaseback arrangements contain covenants
that restrict our operations and any default under such facilities, loans or arrangements could
result in the acceleration of indebtedness, termination of the leases or cross-defaults, any of
which would negatively impact our liquidity and inhibit our ability to grow our business and
increase revenues.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, we had $754.3&nbsp;million of outstanding indebtedness bearing interest at
a weighted-average rate of 6.99%, including $66.3&nbsp;million of capital and financing lease
obligations. Our outstanding indebtedness and leases contain restrictions and covenants and require
us to maintain or satisfy specified financial ratios and coverage tests, including maintaining debt
service and lease coverage ratios on a consolidated basis and on a facility or facilities basis
based on the debt securing the facilities. In addition, certain of our leases require us to
maintain lease coverage ratios on a lease portfolio basis (each as defined in the agreements) and
maintain stockholders&#146; equity or tangible net worth amounts. The debt service coverage ratios are
generally calculated as revenues less operating expenses, including an implied management fee and a
reserve for capital expenditures, divided by the debt (principal and interest) or lease payment.
Stockholders&#146; equity is calculated in accordance with GAAP, and in certain circumstances less
intangible assets or liabilities, or stockholders&#146; equity plus deferred gains from sale-leaseback
transactions. These restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financing or to engage
in other business activities, which may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase
revenues. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, then the related indebtedness could
become immediately due and payable. We cannot assure you that we could pay this debt if it became
due.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our outstanding indebtedness and leases are secured by the facilities and, in certain cases, a
guaranty by us, BLC and/or Alterra. Therefore, an event of default under the outstanding
indebtedness or leases, subject to cure provisions in certain instances, would give the respective
lenders or lessors, as applicable, the right to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately
due and payable, terminate the lease, foreclose on collateral securing the outstanding indebtedness
and leases and restrict our ability to make additional borrowings under the outstanding
indebtedness or continue to operate the properties subject to the lease. Certain of our outstanding
indebtedness and leases contain cross-default provisions so that a default under certain
outstanding indebtedness would cause a default under certain of our operating leases. Certain of
our outstanding indebtedness and long-term leases also restrict, among other things, our ability to
incur additional debt.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial majority of our lease arrangements are structured as master leases. Under a
master lease, we may lease a large number of geographically dispersed properties through an
indivisible lease. As a result, it is difficult to restructure the composition of the portfolio or
economic terms of the lease without the consent of the landlord. Failure to comply with Medicare or
Medicaid provider requirements is a default under several of our master lease and debt financing
instruments. In addition, potential defaults related to an individual property may cause a default
of an entire master lease portfolio and could trigger cross-default provisions in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain of our master leases also contain radius restrictions which limit our ability to

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mortgage debt and long-term lease obligations increase our risk of loss because defaults on
indebtedness secured by properties or pursuant to the terms of the lease may result in foreclosure
actions initiated by lenders or lessors and ultimately our loss of the property securing any loans
for which we are in default or cause the lessor to terminate the lease. For tax purposes, a
foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase
price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding
balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would
recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash proceeds, which could
negatively impact our earnings. Further, our mortgage debt and long-term leases generally contain
cross-default and cross-collateralization provisions and a default on one facility could affect a
significant number of our facilities, financing arrangements and operating leases.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We plan to grow organically through our existing operations, through selectively purchasing
existing senior living operating companies and facilities, and through the expansion of our
existing facilities. In 2005, prior to our initial public offering we acquired the ownership or
management of 15 senior living facilities with 4,077 units/beds (including 817 resident-owned
cottages on our CCRC campuses managed by us) and two additional facilities with an aggregate of 422
units/beds, which were sold in the third quarter of 2005, one of which we continued to manage to
January&nbsp;2006. Since our initial public offering in November&nbsp;2005, we have purchased or have
committed to purchase $743&nbsp;million in senior housing assets representing 101 facilities (9,015
units/beds). This growth will place significant demands on our current management resources. Our
ability to manage our growth effectively and to successfully integrate new acquisitions and
expansions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our operational,
financial and management information systems and to continue to retain, attract, train, motivate
and manage key employees. For example, in connection with the purchase of the Prudential Portfolio,
we significantly expanded one of our operating divisions to manage these assets. Although we
believe we were successful in attracting qualified individuals to work in this division, there can
be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting qualified individuals in future
acquisitions to the extent necessary, and management may expend significant time and energy
attracting the appropriate personnel to manage assets we purchase in the future. Also, the
additional facilities will require us to maintain consistent quality control measures that allow
our management to effectively identify deviations that result in delivering care and services that
are substandard, which may result in litigation and/or loss of licensure or certification. If we
are unable to manage our growth effectively and successfully integrate new acquisitions and
expansions into our existing business or maintain consistent quality control measures, our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our growth strategy contemplates future acquisitions of existing senior living operating
companies and facilities. Despite our extensive underwriting and due diligence procedures,
facilities that we may acquire in the future may generate unexpectedly low or no returns or may not
meet a risk profile that our investors find acceptable. In addition, we might encounter
unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any of the acquired facilities, including
contingent liabilities, or newly acquired facilities might require significant management attention
that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. For example, a facility may require
capital expenditures in excess of budgeted amounts, or it may experience management turnover that
is higher than we project. These costs may negatively affect our future profitability.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several real estate investment trusts, or REITs, have similar asset acquisition objectives as
we do, along with greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we are able to
obtain. This may increase competition for acquisitions that would be suitable to us, making it more
difficult for us to compete and successfully implement our growth strategy. There is significant

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued expansion of our business through the acquisition of existing senior living
operating companies and facilities and expansion of our existing facilities may require additional
capital, particularly if we were to accelerate our acquisition and expansion plans. Financing may
not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable. In addition,
certain of our outstanding indebtedness and long-term leases restrict, among other things, our
ability to incur additional debt. If we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain it on terms
acceptable to us, we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our growth strategies. Further, if
additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity securities, the percentage
ownership of our stockholders would be diluted. Any newly issued equity securities may have
rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs to seniors associated with independent and assisted living services are not generally
reimbursable under government reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Accordingly,
over 96% of our resident fee revenues are derived from private pay sources consisting of income or
assets of residents and/or their family members. Only seniors with income or assets meeting or
exceeding the comparable median in the regions where our facilities are located typically can
afford to pay our monthly resident fees. Economic downturns or changes in demographics could
adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford our resident fees. In addition, downturns in the
housing markets would adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford our resident fees as our
customers frequently use the proceeds from the sale of their homes to cover the cost of our fees.
If we are unable to retain and/or attract seniors with sufficient income, assets or other resources
required to pay the fees associated with independent and assisted living services, our occupancy
rates, revenues and results of operations would decline.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>The geographic concentration of our facilities could leave us vulnerable to an economic downturn,

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004, our facilities located in Florida accounted
for approximately 13.6% and 13.7% of our revenue, our facilities located in Illinois accounted for
approximately 9.0% and 9.8% of our revenue and our facilities located in California accounted for
approximately 6.0% <U> </U> and 3.6%, respectively, of our revenue. As a result of this
concentration, the conditions of local economies and real estate markets, changes in governmental
rules and regulations, particularly with respect to assisted living facilities, acts of nature and
other factors that may result in a decrease in demand for senior living services in these states
could have an adverse effect on our revenues, costs and results of operations. In addition, since
these facilities are located in Florida and California, we are particularly susceptible to revenue
loss, cost increase or damage caused by hurricanes or other severe weather conditions or natural
disasters such as earthquakes. Any significant loss due to a natural disaster may not be covered by
insurance and may lead to an increase in the cost of insurance.

affect our revenues, earnings and occupancy levels.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State regulations governing assisted living facilities require written resident agreements
with each resident. Several of these regulations also require that each resident have the right to
terminate the resident agreement for any reason on reasonable notice. Consistent with these
regulations, several of our assisted living resident agreements allow residents to terminate their
agreements upon 0 to 30&nbsp;days&#146; notice. Unlike typical apartment leasing or independent living
arrangements that involve lease agreements with specified leasing periods of up to a year or
longer, in many instances we cannot contract with our assisted living residents to stay in those
living spaces for longer periods of time. Our independent living resident agreements generally
provide for termination of the lease upon death or allow a resident to terminate his or her lease
upon the need for a higher level of care not provided at the facility. The resident is usually
obligated to pay rent for the lesser of 60&nbsp;days after the move out or until the unit is rented by
another resident. If multiple residents terminate their resident agreements at or around the same
time, our revenues, earnings and occupancy levels could be adversely affected. In addition, because
of the demographics of our typical residents, including age and health, resident turnover rates in
our facilities are difficult to predict. As a result, the living spaces we lease may be unoccupied
for a period of time, which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Early termination or non-renewal of our management agreements could cause a loss in revenues and
could negatively impact earnings.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 0.5% of our revenues were generated through third-party management agreements
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005. Our third-party management agreements generally have terms of
one to five years. In some cases, subject to our rights to cure defaults, a facility owner may
terminate us as manager if any licenses or certificates necessary for operation are revoked or upon
the sale of the facility. Under our management agreements in connection with sale-leaseback
transactions, we cannot be terminated as manager unless we default under the related lease or are
otherwise terminated for cause under the related lease. Early termination or non-renewal of our
management agreements, or renewal on less favorable terms, could cause a loss in revenues and could
negatively impact earnings.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Increased competition for or a shortage of skilled personnel could increase our staffing and labor
costs, which would have an adverse effect on our profitability and/or our ability to conduct our
business operations.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success depends on our ability to retain and attract skilled management personnel who are
responsible for the day-to-day operations of each of our facilities. Each facility has an Executive
Director or Residence Director, each a Director, responsible for the overall day-to-day operations
of the facility, including quality of care, social services and financial performance. Depending
upon the size of the facility, each Director is supported by a facility staff member who is
directly responsible for day-to-day care of the residents and either facility staff or regional
support to oversee the facility&#146;s marketing and community outreach programs. Other key positions
supporting each facility may include individuals responsible for food service, healthcare services,
activities, housekeeping and engineering. We compete with various health care service providers,
including other senior living providers, in retaining and attracting qualified and skilled
personnel. Increased competition for or a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel, or general
inflationary pressures may require that we enhance our pay and benefits package to compete
effectively for such personnel. We may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the
rates we charge to our residents. Turnover rates and the magnitude of the shortage of nurses or
other trained personnel varies substantially from facility to facility. Although reliable
industry-wide data on key employee retention does not exist, we believe that our employee retention
rates are consistent with those of other national senior housing operators. If there is an increase
in these costs, our profitability would be negatively affected. In addition, if we fail to attract
and retain qualified and skilled personnel, our ability to conduct our business operations
effectively and our overall operating results could be harmed.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2005, we had approximately $191.7&nbsp;million of unhedged obligations consisting
of $106.5&nbsp;million and $85.2&nbsp;million of unhedged floating-rate debt and lease payment obligations,
respectively, outstanding at a combined weighted-average floating interest rate of 5.00%. In
February&nbsp;2006, we hedged $5.0&nbsp;million of our debt obligations at 4.96% for five years. Our
unhedged debt and lease obligations include $180.9&nbsp;million tied to the tax-exempt bond rates and
are subject to interest rate caps at a weighted average cap rate of 6.17%. This debt, and any
unhedged floating-rate debt incurred in the future, exposes us to interest rate risk. Therefore,
increases in prevailing interest rates could increase our payment obligations which would
negatively impact our liquidity and earnings. For example, a 1% increase in interest rates would
increase annual interest expense and lease expense by approximately $1.1&nbsp;million and $0.9&nbsp;million

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;15, 2005, our board of directors declared our second quarterly cash dividend of
$0.25 per share of our common stock, or an aggregate of $16.5&nbsp;million, for the three months ended
December&nbsp;31, 2005, which we paid on January&nbsp;16, 2006. On March&nbsp;13, 2006, our board of directors
declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share of our common stock, or an aggregate of $23.2
million for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2006. The $0.35 per share dividend is payable on April&nbsp;14,
2006, to holders of record of our common stock on March&nbsp;31, 2006. We intend to continue to pay
regular quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock. However, our ability to pay and
maintain cash dividends is based on many factors, including our ability to make and finance
acquisitions, our ability to negotiate favorable lease and other contractual terms, anticipated
operating expense levels, the level of demand for our units/beds, the rates we charge and actual
results that may vary substantially from estimates. Some of the factors are beyond our control and
a change in any such factor could affect our ability to pay or maintain dividends. We can give no
assurance as to our ability to pay or maintain dividends. We also cannot assure you that the level
of dividends will be maintained or increase over time or that increases in demand for our
units/beds and monthly resident fees will increase our actual cash available for dividends to
stockholders. We expect that in certain quarters we may pay dividends that exceed our net income

(&#147;Ventas&#148;) in 2004, two legal actions have been filed. The first action was filed on September&nbsp;15,
2005 by current and former limited partners in 36 investing partnerships in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of New York captioned <I>David T. Atkins et. al. v. Apollo
Real Estate Advisors, L.P., et al </I>(the &#147;Action&#148;)<I>. </I>On March&nbsp;17, 2006, a third amended complaint was
filed in the Action. The third amended complaint is brought on behalf of current and former
limited partners in 14 investing partnerships. It names as defendants, among others, the Company,
Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. (&#147;BLCI&#148;), a subsidiary of the Company, GFB-AS Investors, LLC
(&#147;GFB-AS&#148;), a subsidiary of BLCI, the general partners of the 14 investing partnerships, which are
alleged to be subsidiaries of GFB-AS, Fortress Investment Group LLC (&#147;FIG&#148;), an affiliate of our
largest stockholder, and our Chief Financial Officer. The nine count third amended complaint
alleges, among other things, (i)&nbsp;that the defendants converted for their own use the property of
the limited partners of 11 partnerships, including through the failure to obtain consents the
plaintiffs contend were required for the sale of facilities indirectly owned by those partnerships
to Ventas; (ii)&nbsp;that the defendants fraudulently persuaded the limited partners of three

consists only of those limited partners in the four investing partnerships who are not plaintiffs
in the Action. The Second Action names as defendants BLCI and GFB-AS. The complaint alleges a
claim for breach of fiduciary duty arising out of the sale of facilities indirectly owned by the
investing partnerships to Ventas and the subsequent lease of those facilities by Ventas to
subsidiaries of BLCI. The plaintiffs seek, among other relief, an accounting, damages in an
unspecified amount, and disgorgement of unspecified amounts by which the defendants were allegedly
unjustly enriched. We also intend to vigorously defend this Second Action. Because these actions
are in an early stage we cannot estimate the possible range of loss, if any.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulatory environment surrounding the senior living industry continues to evolve and
intensify in the amount and type of laws and regulations affecting it, many of which vary from
state to state. In addition, many senior living facilities are subject to regulation and licensing
by state and local health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities. In several
of the states in which we operate or may operate, we are prohibited from providing certain higher
levels of senior care services without first obtaining the appropriate

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">licenses. Also, in several of the states in which we operate or intend to operate, assisted
living facilities and/or skilled nursing facilities require a certificate of need before the
facility can be opened or the services at an existing facility can be expanded. See &#147;Business &#151;
Government Regulation&#148; for a description of some of the specific laws and regulations applicable to
us. Furthermore, federal, state and local officials are increasingly focusing their efforts on
enforcement of these laws, particularly with respect to large for-profit, multi-facility providers
like us. These requirements, and the increased enforcement thereof, could affect our ability to
expand into new markets, to expand our services and facilities in existing markets and, if any of
our presently licensed facilities were to operate outside of its licensing authority, may subject
us to penalties including closure of the facility. Future regulatory developments as well as
mandatory increases in the scope and severity of deficiencies determined by survey or inspection
officials could cause our operations to suffer. We are unable to predict the future course of
federal, state and local legislation or regulation. If regulatory requirements increase, whether
through enactment of new laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing rules, our
earnings and operations could be adversely affected.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intensified regulatory and enforcement environment impacts providers like us because of
the increase in the number of inspections or surveys by governmental authorities and consequent
citations for failure to comply with regulatory requirements. We also expend considerable resources
to respond to federal and state investigations or other enforcement action. From time to time in
the ordinary course of business, we receive deficiency reports from state regulatory bodies
resulting from such inspections or surveys. Although most inspection deficiencies are resolved
through an agreed-to plan of corrective action, the reviewing agency typically has the authority to
take further action against a licensed or certified facility, which could result in the imposition
of fines, imposition of a provisional or conditional license, suspension or revocation of a
license, suspension or denial of admissions, loss of certification as a provider under federal
health care programs or imposition of other sanctions, including criminal penalties. Furthermore,
certain states may allow citations in one facility to impact other facilities in the state.
Revocation of a license at a given facility could therefore impact our ability to obtain new
licenses or to renew existing licenses at other facilities, which may also cause us to be in
default under our leases, trigger cross-defaults, trigger defaults under certain of our credit
agreements or adversely affect our ability to operate and/or obtain financing in the future. If a
state were to find that one facility&#146;s citation would impact another of our facilities, this would
also increase costs and result in increased surveillance by the state survey agency. To date, none
of the deficiency reports received by us has resulted in a suspension, fine or other disposition
that has had a material adverse effect on our revenues. However, the failure to comply with
applicable legal and regulatory requirements in the future could result in a material adverse
effect to our business as a whole.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various extremely complex federal and state laws governing a wide array of referral
relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by health care providers, including those in
the senior living industry, and governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention and
resources to such anti-fraud initiatives. Some examples are the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and the False Claims Act,
which gives private individuals the ability to bring an action on behalf of the federal government.
See &#147;Business &#151; Government Regulation&#148; for a description of these laws. The violation of any of
these laws or regulations may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties that could
increase our costs and otherwise jeopardize our business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, in several states, we operate facilities that participate in federal and/or
state health care reimbursement programs, which makes us subject to federal and state laws that
prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for reimbursement which are
false, fraudulent or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Similar state
laws vary from state to state and we cannot be sure that these laws will be interpreted
consistently or in keeping with past practice. Violation of any of these laws can result in loss of
licensure, civil or criminal penalties and exclusion of health care providers or suppliers from
furnishing covered items or services to beneficiaries of the applicable federal and/or state health
care reimbursement program. Loss of licensure may also cause us to default under our leases and/or
trigger cross-defaults.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also subject to certain federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements by
health care providers, such as the Federal Anti-Kickback Law, the Stark laws and certain state
referral laws. See &#147;Business &#151; Government Regulation.&#148; Authorities have interpreted the Federal
Anti-Kickback Law very broadly to apply to many practices and relationships between health care
providers and sources of patient

possible exclusion from government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, which may also cause us
to default under our leases and/or trigger cross-defaults. Adverse consequences may also result if
we violate federal Stark laws related to certain Medicare and Medicaid physician referrals. While
we endeavor to comply with all laws that regulate the licensure and operation of our senior living
facilities, it is difficult to predict how our revenues could be affected if we were subject to an
action alleging such violations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Fair Housing Act and fire, safety and other
regulations may require us to make unanticipated expenditures which could increase our costs and
therefore adversely affect our earnings, financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to
stockholders.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of our facilities are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA.
The ADA has separate compliance requirements for &#147;public accommodations&#148; and &#147;commercial
properties,&#148; but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities.
Compliance with ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could
result in imposition of government fines or an award of damages to private litigants.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also comply with the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits us from discriminating against
individuals on certain bases in any of our practices if it would cause such individuals to face
barriers in gaining residency in any of our facilities. Additionally, the Fair Housing Act and
other state laws require that we advertise our services in such a way that we promote diversity and
not limit it. We may be required, among other things, to change our marketing techniques to comply
with these requirements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we are required to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable fire and
safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations and food licensing or
certification requirements as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies from time to
time. Like other health care facilities, senior living facilities are subject to periodic survey or
inspection by governmental authorities to assess and assure compliance with regulatory
requirements. Surveys occur on a regular (often annual or bi-annual) schedule, and special surveys
may result from a specific complaint filed by a resident, a family member or one of our
competitors. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those
requirements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital expenditures we have made to comply with any of the above to date have been
immaterial, however, the increased costs and capital expenditures that we may incur in order to
comply with any of the above would result in a negative effect on our earnings, financial condition
and our ability to pay dividends to stockholders.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Significant legal actions and liability claims against us in excess of insurance limits could
subject us to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which may adversely
affect our financial condition and operating results.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior living business entails an inherent risk of liability, particularly given the
demographics of our residents, including age and health, and the services we provide. In recent
years, we, as well as other participants in our industry, have been subject to an increasing number
of claims and lawsuits alleging that our services have resulted in resident injury or other adverse
effects. Many of these lawsuits involve large damage claims and significant legal costs. Many
states continue to consider tort reform and how it will apply to the senior living industry. We may
continue to be faced with the threat of large jury verdicts in jurisdictions that do not find favor
with large senior living providers. We maintain liability insurance policies in amounts and with
the coverage and deductibles we believe are adequate based on the nature and risks of our business,
historical experience and industry standards. In the past year, we have not had any claims that
exceeded our policy limits. However, there can be no guarantee that we will not have such claims in
the future.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently maintain the following liability insurance: a $25.0&nbsp;million primary limit of
general and healthcare professional liability insurance coverage, inclusive of at least a $15.0
million sub-limit of healthcare professional liability ($25.0&nbsp;million sub-limit for designated
locations). This insurance coverage is

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">on a per claim and aggregate basis with a self-insured retention of $1.0&nbsp;million. The general
and professional liability coverage is arranged on a three-year, shared-limit basis, with a
pre-negotiated reinstatement of limit provision that will allow for the re-purchase of the lead
$15.0&nbsp;million of general and professional liability coverage, at a set additional premium, should
adverse claims experience be realized during the policy term. In addition to this $25.0&nbsp;million
primary limit, we have arranged $25.0&nbsp;million excess general liability-only insurance coverage on a
per claim and aggregate basis.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, we maintain primary workers&#146; compensation insurance, which includes a $0.5
million deductible per occurrence, employer&#146;s liability and auto liability insurance in compliance
with statutory limits and requirements and a $20.0&nbsp;million excess auto liability and employer&#146;s
liability coverage, over a primary auto and employer&#146;s liability $1.0&nbsp;million policy limit, on a
per-occurrence, annual aggregate basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also currently maintain the following property insurance: a $300.0&nbsp;million per-occurrence
primary policy limit, which contains various sub-limits of coverage, most notably for the perils of
flood and earthquake, limited to $50.0&nbsp;million on a per-occurrence and annual aggregate basis.
Terrorism coverage is provided for other than the peril of earthquake to the noted policy limits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a successful claim is made against us and it is not covered by our insurance or exceeds the
policy limits, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely
affected. In some states, state law may prohibit or limit insurance coverage for the risk of
punitive damages arising from professional liability and general liability claims and/or
litigation. As a result, we may be liable for punitive damage awards in these states that either
are not covered or are in excess of our insurance policy limits. Also, the above deductibles, or
self-insured retention, are accrued based on an actuarial projection of future liabilities. If this
projection is inaccurate and if there are an unexpectedly large number of successful claims that
result in liabilities in excess of our self-insured retention, our operating results could be
negatively affected. Claims against us, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also could
have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract residents or expand our business and could
require our management to devote time to matters unrelated to the day-to-day operation of our
business. We also have to renew our policies every year and negotiate acceptable terms for
coverage, exposing us to the volatility of the insurance markets, including the possibility of rate
increases. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain liability insurance in the
future or, if available, that such coverage will be available on acceptable terms.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Overbuilding, increased competition and increased operating costs may adversely affect our ability
to generate and increase our revenues and profits and to pursue our growth strategy.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior living industry is highly competitive, and we expect that it may become more
competitive in the future. We compete with numerous other companies that provide long-term care
alternatives such as home healthcare agencies, life care at home, facility-based service programs,
retirement communities, convalescent centers and other independent living, assisted living and
skilled nursing providers, including not-for-profit entities. In general, regulatory and other
barriers to competitive entry in the independent living and assisted living segments of the senior
living industry are not substantial, except in the skilled nursing segment. We have experienced and
expect to continue to experience increased competition in our efforts to acquire and operate senior
living facilities. Consequently, we may encounter increased competition that could limit our
ability to attract new residents, raise resident fees or expand our business, which could have a
material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, overbuilding in the late 1990s in the senior living industry reduced the
occupancy rates of several newly constructed buildings and, in some cases, reduced the monthly rate
that some newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services.
This resulted in lower revenues for certain of our facilities during that time. While we believe
that overbuilt markets have stabilized and should continue to be stabilized for the immediate
future, we cannot be certain that the effects of this period of overbuilding will not effect our
occupancy and resident fee rate levels in the future, nor can we be certain that another period of
overbuilding in the future will not have the same effects. Moreover, while we believe that the new
construction dynamics and the competitive environments in Florida, Illinois and California are
substantially similar to the national market, taken as a whole, if the dynamics or environment were
to be significantly adverse in one or more of those states, it would have a disproportionate effect
on our revenues (due to the large portion of our revenues that are generated in those states).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by offering debt or additional
equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes,
series of preferred shares or shares of our common stock. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt
securities and preferred shares, and lenders with respect to other borrowings, would receive a
distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity
offerings may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders or reduce the
market price of our common stock, or both. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference
with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that
could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision
to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors
beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future
offerings. Thus, holders

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our
common stock and diluting their share holdings in us.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2005 we had an aggregate of 131,811,017 shares of common stock authorized
but unissued and not reserved for issuance under our option plans. We may issue all of these shares
without any action or approval by our stockholders. We intend to continue to actively pursue
acquisitions of senior living facilities and may issue shares of common stock in connection with
these acquisitions. Any shares issued in connection with our acquisitions, the exercise of
outstanding stock options or otherwise would dilute the holdings of our current stockholders.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Fluctuation of market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the value of your investment in
our common stock.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common
stock is our dividend payment per share as a percentage of our share price relative to market
interest rates. If market interest rates increase, prospective investors may desire a higher rate
of return on our common stock and therefore may seek securities paying higher dividends or interest
or offering a higher rate of return than shares of our common stock. As a result, market interest
rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions can affect the demand for and market value of
our common stock. For instance, if interest rates rise, it is likely that the market price of our
common stock will decrease, because current stockholders and potential investors will likely
require a higher dividend yield and rate of return on our common stock as interest-bearing
securities, such as bonds, offer more attractive returns.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>The market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts
of our common stock in the public markets.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As March&nbsp;14, 2006, there are 65,006,833 shares of our common stock outstanding. All the
shares of our common stock sold in our initial public offering are freely transferable, except for
any shares held by our &#147;affiliates,&#148; as that term is defined in Rule&nbsp;144 under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to our Stockholders Agreement, Fortress and Health Partners, an affiliate of Capital
Z Partners, and certain of their related partnerships and permitted third-party transferees have
the right, in certain circumstances, to require us to register their 51,001,625 shares of our
common stock under the Securities Act for sale into the public markets. Upon the effectiveness of
such a registration statement, all shares covered by the registration statement will be freely
transferable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, following the completion of our initial public offering, we filed a registration
statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of our
common stock reserved for issuance under our stock incentive programs. Subject to any restrictions
imposed on the shares granted under our stock incentive programs, shares registered under the
registration statement on Form S-8 will be available for sale into the public markets, subject to
the 120-day lock-up agreements described above. All participants in the directed shares program
also agreed to similar restrictions on the ability to sell their common stock.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Item&nbsp;3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the sale of certain facilities to Ventas Realty Limited Partnership
(&#147;Ventas&#148;) in 2004, two legal actions have been filed. The first action was filed on September&nbsp;15,
2005 by current and former limited partners in 36 investing partnerships in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of New York captioned <I>David T. Atkins et. al. v. Apollo
Real Estate Advisors, L.P., et al </I>(the &#147;Action&#148;)<I>. </I>On March&nbsp;17, 2006, a third amended complaint was
filed in the Action. The third amended complaint is brought on behalf of current and former
limited partners in 14 investing partnerships. It names as defendants, among others, the Company,
BLC, GFB-AS Investors, LLC (&#147;GFB-AS&#148;), a subsidiary of BLC, the general partners of the 14
investing partnerships, which are alleged to be subsidiaries of GFB-AS, Fortress Investment Group
LLC, an affiliate of our largest stockholder, and our Chief Financial Officer. The nine count
third amended complaint alleges, among other things, (i)&nbsp;that the defendants converted for their
own use the property of the limited partners of 11 partnerships, including through the failure to
obtain consents the plaintiffs contend were required for the sale of facilities indirectly owned by
those partnerships to Ventas; (ii)&nbsp;that the defendants fraudulently persuaded the limited partners
of three partnerships to give up a valuable property right based upon incomplete, false and
misleading statements in connection with certain consent solicitations; (iii)&nbsp;that the defendants
committed mail fraud in connection with the sale of facilities indirectly owned by the 14
partnerships at issue in the Action to Ventas; (iv)&nbsp;that the defendants committed wire fraud in
connection with certain communications with plaintiffs in the Action and another investor in a
limited partnership; (v)&nbsp;that the defendants, with the exception of the Company, committed
substantive violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (&#147;RICO&#148;); (vi)
that the defendants conspired to violate RICO; (vii)&nbsp;that GFB-AS and the general partners violated
the partnership agreements of the 14 investing partnerships; (viii)&nbsp;that GFB-AS, the general
partners, and our Chief Financial Officer breached fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs; and (vii)
that the defendants were unjustly enriched. The plaintiffs have asked for damages in excess of
$100.0&nbsp;million on each of the counts described above, including treble damages for the RICO claims.
We intend to file a motion to dismiss the claims, and to continue to vigorously defend this
Action. A putative class action lawsuit was also filed on March&nbsp;22, 2006 by certain limited
partners in four of the same partnerships involved in the Action in the Court of Chancery for the
State of Delaware captioned <I>Edith Zimmerman et al. v. GFB-AS Investors, LLC and Brookdale Living
Communities, Inc. </I>(the &#147;Second Action&#148;). The putative class in the Second Action consists only of
those limited partners in the four investing partnerships who are not plaintiffs in the Action.
The Second Action names as defendants BLC and GFB-AS. The complaint alleges a claim for breach of
fiduciary duty arising out of the sale of facilities indirectly owned by the investing partnerships
to Ventas and the subsequent lease of those facilities by Ventas to subsidiaries of BLC. The
plaintiffs seek, among other relief, an accounting, damages in an unspecified amount, and
disgorgement of unspecified amounts by which the defendants were allegedly unjustly enriched. We
also intend to vigorously defend this Second Action. Because these actions are in an early stage
we cannot estimate the possible range of loss, if any.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we have been involved in litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of our
business comparable to other companies in the senior living industry. Certain claims and lawsuits
allege large damage claims and may require significant legal costs to defend and resolve.
Similarly, our industry is always subject to scrutiny by governmental regulators, which could
result in litigation related to regulatory compliance matters. As a result, we maintain insurance
policies in amounts and with the coverage and deductibles we believe are adequate, based on the
nature and risks of our business, historical experience and industry standards. We believe that the
cost of defending any pending or future litigation or challenging any pending or future regulatory
compliance matter will not have a material adverse effect on our business.

Exchange on March&nbsp;27, 2006 was $38.65&nbsp;per share. As of that date there were 29 holders of

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;22, 2005, we consummated our initial public offering of 12,732,800 shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, consisting of 8,560,800 primary shares (including
1,660,800 shares pursuant to the option granted by us to the Underwriters to purchase up to an
additional 1,660,800 shares of common stock to cover over-allotments) and 4,172,000 shares sold by
the selling stockholders. We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling
stockholders. The shares of common stock sold in the offering were registered under the Securities
Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (Registration No.&nbsp;333-127372) that was declared
effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on November&nbsp;21, 2005. The managing
underwriters were Goldman, Sachs &#038; Co., Lehman Brothers Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and UBS
Securities LLC. All of the shares sold by us and by the selling stockholders were sold at a price
of $19.00 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds from the shares of common stock sold by us and
the selling stockholders were $241.9&nbsp;million. We received net proceeds of approximately $144.8
million, after deducting an aggregate of $16.9&nbsp;million in underwriting discounts and commissions
paid to the underwriters and an estimated $6.4&nbsp;million in other direct expenses incurred in
connection with the offering. None of the proceeds from the offering were paid, directly or
indirectly, to any of the Company&#146;s officers or directors or any of their associates, or to any
persons owning ten percent or more of the Company&#146;s outstanding shares of common stock or to any of
the Company&#146;s affiliates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon consummation of the offering, we applied approximately (i) $7.8&nbsp;million of the net
proceeds of the offering to the repayment of the debt outstanding under a first mortgage loan
encumbering our Westbury Care Center facility; (ii) $32.3&nbsp;million to the repayment of the notes B
portion of our $182.0&nbsp;million first mortgage loan entered into in March&nbsp;2005 with Guaranty Bank;
(iii) $9.5&nbsp;million to the repayment in full of our term loan from LaSalle bank National
Association; (iv) $2.5&nbsp;million to the repayment in full of the debt outstanding related to Assisted

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;14, 2006, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per
share of our common stock, or an aggregate of $23.2&nbsp;million for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2005.
The $0.35 per share dividend is payable on April&nbsp;14, 2006, to holders of record of our common stock
on March&nbsp;31, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;15, 2005, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per
share of our common stock, or an aggregate of $16.5&nbsp;million for the quarter ending December&nbsp;31,
2005, which we paid on January&nbsp;16, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;30, 2005, we paid a dividend of $0.25 per share of our common stock, or an
aggregate of $14.4&nbsp;million for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2005, which we paid on October&nbsp;7,
2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock.
However, our ability to pay and maintain cash dividends is based on many factors, including our
ability to make and finance acquisitions, our ability to negotiate favorable lease and other
contractual terms, anticipated operating expense levels, the level of demand for our units/beds,
the rates we charge and actual results that may vary substantially from estimates. Some of the
factors are beyond our control and a change in any such factor could affect our ability to pay or
maintain dividends. We can give no assurance as to our ability to pay or maintain dividends. We
also cannot assure you that the level of dividends will be maintained or increase over time or that
increases in demand for our units/beds and monthly resident fees will increase our actual cash
available for dividends to stockholders. We expect that in certain quarters we may pay dividends
that exceed our net income amount for such period as calculated in accordance with GAAP. The
failure to pay or maintain dividends would adversely affect our stock price.

acquired certain senior living facilities from Prudential Financial, Inc., for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $282.4&nbsp;million (including the assumption of

fully vested and are not subject to risk of forfeiture. In accordance with the terms of the plans,
a portion of these securities are no longer subject to a risk of forfeiture following the
consummation of our initial public offering. In addition, the remaining securities will vest over a
five-year period following the issuance if the executive remains continuously employed by the
Company. Securities that are subject to a risk of forfeiture may not be sold or transferred. In
connection with the merger transactions described in above, these shares and membership interests

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Executive Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, we are the third largest operator of senior living facilities in the
United States based on total capacity with over 380 facilities in 31 states and the ability to
serve over 30,000 residents. We offer our residents access to a full continuum of services across
all sectors of the senior living industry. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, we operated 80 independent
living facilities with 14,439 units/beds, 295 assisted living facilities with 12,529 units/beds,
seven continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs, with 3,005 units/beds (including 817
resident-owned cottages on our CCRC campuses managed by us) and one skilled nursing facility with
82 units/beds. The majority of our units/beds are located in campus settings or facilities
containing multiple services, including CCRCs. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, our facilities were on
average 89.8% occupied. We generate over 96% of our revenues from private pay customers, which
limits our exposure to government reimbursement risk. In addition, we control all financial and
operational decisions regarding our facilities through property ownership and long-term leases. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2005, we are in compliance with the financial covenants of our debt and lease
agreements. We believe we operate in the most attractive sectors of the senior living industry with
significant opportunities to increase our revenues through providing a combination of housing,
hospitality services and health care services. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, 28.7% of our
revenues were generated from owned facilities, 70.8% from leased facilities and 0.5% from
management fees from facilities we operate on behalf of third parties and affiliates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were formed in June&nbsp;2005 for the purpose of combining two leading senior living operating
companies, Brookdale Living Communities, Inc., or BLC, and Alterra Healthcare Corporation, or
Alterra. BLC and Alterra have been operating independently since 1986 and 1981, respectively. Since
December&nbsp;2003, BLC and Alterra have been under the common control of Fortress. Fortress owns
43,407,000 shares, or over 65% of our common stock. On November&nbsp;22, 2005, we completed our initial
public offering of 12,732,800 shares of our common stock, including 8,560,800 primary shares, at
$19.00 per share, for which we received proceeds, after fees and expenses, of approximately $144.8
million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We plan to grow our revenue and operating income through a combination of: (i)&nbsp;organic growth
in our existing portfolio; (ii)&nbsp;acquisitions of additional operating companies and facilities; and
(iii)&nbsp;the realization of economies of scale, including those created by the BLC and Alterra
combination. Given the size and breadth of our nationwide platform, we believe that we are well
positioned to invest in a broad spectrum of assets in the senior living industry, including
independent living, assisted living, CCRC and skilled nursing assets. Since January&nbsp;2001, we have
begun leasing or acquired the ownership or management 55 senior living facilities (not including
those facilities we acquired and subsequently disposed of) with approximately 10,900 units/beds. In
2005, prior to our initial public offering, we acquired 15 senior living facilities with 4,077
units/beds (including 817 resident-owned cottages on our CCRC campuses managed by us) and two
additional facilities with an aggregate of 422 units/beds, which were sold in the third quarter of
2005, one of which we continued to manage through January, 2006. Since our initial public
offering, we have purchased

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">or committed to purchase $743&nbsp;million in senior housing assets representing 101 facilities
with 9,015 units/beds.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our senior living facilities offer residents a supportive &#147;home-like&#148; setting, assistance with
activities of daily living, or ADLs, and, in a few facilities, licensed skilled nursing services.
By providing residents with a range of service options as their needs change, we provide greater
continuity of care, enabling seniors to &#147;age-in-place&#148; and thereby maintain residency with us for a
longer period of time. The ability of residents to age-in-place is also beneficial to our residents
and their families who are burdened with care decisions for their elderly relatives.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our independent living facilities&#146; average resident is 83&nbsp;years old and desires or needs a
more supportive living environment. The average independent living resident resides in an
independent living facility for 32&nbsp;months. Many of our residents relocate to one of our independent
living facilities in order to be in a metropolitan area that is closer to their adult children. Our
assisted living facilities&#146; average resident is an 83&nbsp;year old who requires assistance with two or
three ADLs. 85% of our assisted living residents require medication management. The average
assisted living resident resides in an assisted living facility for 22&nbsp;months. Residents typically
enter an assisted living facility due to a relatively immediate need for services that might have
been triggered by a medical event or need. Our assisted living facilities consist of 75%
traditional assisted living facilities and 25% memory care facilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overbuilding in the late 1990s in the senior living industry put downward pressure on the
occupancy rates and the resident fees of certain senior living providers. The slowdown in
construction and lack of construction financing since 1999 has led to a reduction in the supply of
new units being constructed. Growing demand for senior living services has resulted in a recent
trend towards increasing occupancy rates and resident fees for operators of existing facilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing consumer awareness among seniors and their families concerning the types of services
provided by independent and assisted living operators has further contributed to the opportunities
in the senior living industry. Also, seniors possess greater financial resources, which makes it
more likely that they are able to afford to live in market-rate senior housing. Seniors in the
geographic areas in which we operate tend to have a significant amount of assets generated from
savings, pensions and, due to strong national housing markets, the sale of private homes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenges in our industry include increased state and local regulation of the assisted living
industry, which has led to an increase in the cost of doing business; the regulatory environment
continues to intensify in the amount and types of laws and regulations affecting us, accompanied by
an increase by state and local officials in enforcement thereof. In addition, like other companies,
our financial results may be negatively impacted by increasing employment costs including salaries,
wages and benefits, such as health care, for our employees. Increases in the costs of utilities and
real estate taxes will also have a negative impact on our financial results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Formation Transactions</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a holding company formed in June&nbsp;2005 for the purpose of combining, through a series of
mergers, two leading senior living operating companies, BLC and Alterra. The combination of these
two companies created a nationwide operating platform to grow our existing portfolio, realize
economies of scale and add to our existing portfolio through strategic acquisitions of existing
assets and/or senior living portfolios. In connection with the combination of BLC and Alterra, we
negotiated new contracts for food, insurance and other goods and services and have and will
continue to consolidate our corporate functions such as accounting, finance, human resources and
legal, which are collectively expected to result in recurring operating and general and
administrative expense savings, net of additional recurring costs expected to be incurred as a
public company, of between approximately $13.0&nbsp;million and
$15.0&nbsp;million per year. We began to realize these savings
upon completion of the formation transactions in September&nbsp;2005 and expect to realize the remainder
before the end of 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the combination of BLC and Alterra, Fortress contributed the Prudential
Portfolio to Alterra in exchange for membership interests in FEBC-ALT Investors and merged the
Fortress CCRC Portfolio with

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in exchange for shares of our common stock.
Alterra purchased the Prudential Portfolio to expand its western presence and to strengthen its
overall financial position. These portfolios together consisted of 17 senior living facilities with
an aggregate of 4,499 units, of which two facilities with an aggregate of 422 units/beds were sold
on July&nbsp;1, 2005 and September&nbsp;14, 2005, for $2.5&nbsp;million and $9.0&nbsp;million, respectively, and the
proceeds of which were contributed to us in the series of formation transactions described in
&#147;Business &#151; History.&#148; An affiliate of BLC managed one of these facilities through January&nbsp;2006.
All of the preceding were purchased in the second and third quarter of 2005 by affiliates of
Fortress.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a holding company, we own 100% of the outstanding stock and membership interests of the
operating companies of our business. The previous stockholders and members of the operating
companies contributed their ownership interests to us in exchange for shares of our common stock.
For financial reporting purposes, the Fortress entities that own the stock or membership interests
in the operating companies are considered the control group as defined under paragraph 3 of EITF
No.&nbsp;02-5, <I>&#147;Definition of &#145;Common Control&#146; in relation to FASB Statement No.&nbsp;141.&#148; </I>Accordingly, the
combined financial statements of the Predecessor Company reflect the historical cost of the
operating companies. Upon the completion of the formation transactions on September&nbsp;30, 2005, the
non-controlling minority interests were accounted for as a purchase in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;141.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these transactions we are the third largest operator of senior living
facilities in the United States based on total capacity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Segments</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seven reportable segments which we determined based on the way that management
organizes the segments within the enterprise for making operating decisions and assessing
performance. In addition, the management approach focuses on financial information that an
enterprise&#146;s decision makers use to make decisions about the enterprise&#146;s operating matters. We
continue to evaluate the type of financial information necessary for the decision makers as we
implement our growth strategies. Prior to September&nbsp;30, 2005 (the date of the formation
transactions described in &#147;Business &#151; History&#148;) and presently, each of Brookdale Living, which
includes BLC, the Fortress CCRC Portfolio and the Prudential Portfolio, and Alterra, had and has
distinct chief operating decision makers, or CODMS. Each of our facilities are considered separate
operating segments because they each engage in business activities from which they earn revenues
and incur expenses, their operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODMS to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and discrete financial
information is available.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;131, <I>Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, </I>permits
aggregation of operating segments that share all common operating characteristics (similar products
and services, similar methods used to deliver or provide their products and services, and similar
type and class of customer for their products and services) and similar economic characteristics
(revenue recognition and gross margin). We believe that each of our 380 facilities provides similar
services, delivers these services in a similar manner, and has common type and class of customer.
In addition, all of our facilities recognize and report revenue in a similar manner. However, our
individual facility gross margins vary significantly. Therefore, we have aggregated our segments
based upon the lowest common economic characteristic of each of our facilities: gross margin. The
CODMS allocate resources in large part based on margin and analyze each of the facilities as having
either (1)&nbsp;less than 20% operating margins, (2)&nbsp;more than 20% operating margins but less than 40%
operating margins, or (3)&nbsp;greater than 40% operating margins. The CODMS believe that the margin is
the primary, most significant and most useful indicator of the necessary allocation of resources to
each individual facility because it is the best indicator of a facility&#146;s operating performance and
resource requirements. Accordingly, our operating segments are aggregated into six reportable
segments based on comparable operating margins within each of Brookdale Living and Alterra. We
define our operating margin for each group of facilities as that group&#146;s operating income divided
by its revenue. Operating income represents revenue less operating expenses (excluding depreciation
and amortization). See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also present a seventh reportable segment for management services because the economic and
operating characteristics of these services are different from our facilities aggregated above.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Brookdale Living. </I>Our Brookdale Living group of facilities operates independent living
facilities and CCRCs that provide a continuum of services, including independent living, assisted
living, Alzheimer&#146;s care, dementia care and skilled nursing care. Our facilities include rental
facilities and three entrance fee facilities. We also provide various ancillary services to our
residents, including extensive wellness programs, personal care and therapy services for all levels
of care. Our facilities are large, often in campus or high-rise settings, with an average unit/bed
capacity of 211units/beds. These facilities generally maintain high and consistent occupancy
levels. We operate 64 facilities, with an aggregate capacity of 13,554 units/beds, representing
approximately 45% of the total unit/bed capacity of our facilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Alterra. </I>Our Alterra group of facilities operates primarily assisted living facilities that
provide specialized assisted living care to residents in a comfortable residential atmosphere. Most
of our facilities provide specialized care, including Alzheimer&#146;s and other dementia programs.
These facilities are designed to provide care in a home-like setting, as opposed to a more
institutional setting. Our assisted living facilities target residents generally requiring
assistance with two or three ADLs and are generally smaller than our Brookdale Living facilities,
with an average unit/bed capacity of 44 units/beds. We operate 303 facilities, with an aggregate
capacity of 13,251 units/beds, representing approximately 44% of the total unit/bed capacity of our
facilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Management Services. </I>Our management services segment includes 16 facilities owned by others
and operated by us pursuant to management agreements. Under our management agreements for these
facilities, we receive management fees as well as reimbursed expense revenues, which represent the
reimbursement of certain expenses we incur on behalf of the owners. These 16 facilities have an
aggregate capacity of 3,250 units/beds, representing approximately 11% of the total unit/bed
capacity of our facilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Revenues</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We generate all of our revenues from resident fees, entrance fees and management fees. For the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately 99.5% and 0.5%, 99.5% and 0.5% and
97.6% and 2.4% of our revenues were generated from resident fees and management fees, respectively.
In addition, we generated a small amount of revenue from entrance fees during 2005, which
accounted for less than 0.1% of our revenue during this period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We derive over 96% of our resident fees from private pay sources. Our resident fees are paid,
on a monthly basis in advance, by residents, their families or other responsible parties, typically
out of personal income, assets or other savings. As a result, economic downturns or changes in
demographics, among other things, could impact our ability to charge and collect resident fees.
Ancillary charges are billed in arrears.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Resident Fees. </I></B>We generate resident fee revenue on a monthly basis from each resident in each
facility that we own and operate or lease and operate. The rates we charge are highly dependent on
local market conditions and the competitive environment in which the facilities operate.
Substantially all of our independent and assisted living residency agreements allow for adjustments
in the monthly fee payable thereunder not less frequently than 12 or 13&nbsp;months, or monthly,
respectively, thereby enabling us to seek increases in monthly fees due to inflation, increased
levels of care or other factors. Any such pricing increase would be subject to market and
competitive conditions and could result in a decrease in occupancy in the facilities. In addition,
regulations governing assisted living facilities in several states stipulate that each resident
must have the right to terminate the resident agreement for any reason on reasonable notice.
Consistent with these regulations, a majority of our assisted living resident agreements allow
residents to terminate their agreements upon 0 to 30&nbsp;days&#146; notice. Our independent living
facilities generally allow residents to terminate their leases upon the need for a higher level of
care not provided at the facility or death. Upon termination of a lease, the resident is usually
obligated to pay rent for the lesser of 60&nbsp;days after he or she vacates the unit or until the unit
is rented by another resident.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On average, for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we generated resident fees
of approximately $2,921, $2,827 and $2,660 per unit/bed per month, respectively, and approximately
$786.7&nbsp;million, $657.3&nbsp;million and $217.2&nbsp;million, respectively, in resident fee revenue. The

during both periods which includes the lease-up of four facilities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Entrance Fees. </I></B>In three of our CCRC facilities, independent living residents pay an entrance
fee upon moving into the facility in addition to a monthly fee. We have two types of entrance fee
arrangements, as described below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two of our facilities, a portion of the entrance fee is generally non-refundable and a
portion is refundable. The non-refundable portion of the fee is initially recorded as deferred
revenue and amortized to revenue over the estimated stay of the resident in the facility. The
refundable portion of the fee is generally refundable upon the resale of the unit, or in certain
agreements upon resale of a comparable unit or 12&nbsp;months after the resident vacates the unit and is
classified as current liabilities. Based on market conditions and resident preferences we
periodically review our entrance fee arrangements to determine the amount of the fee and the
allocation between the refundable and non-refundable portions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one facility the entrance fee is refundable to the resident pro rata over a 67-month
period. Accordingly, the fee is amortized to revenue over 67&nbsp;months.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2005 we received $5.2&nbsp;million of entrance fees and refunded
$2.7&nbsp;million. We had no entrance fees prior to 2005. Of the amount received, $1.2&nbsp;million is
deferred and amortized and $30.7&nbsp;million, including net obligations assumed in connection with the
purchase, is refundable to the resident generally upon resale of the unit or a comparable unit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Management Fees. </I></B>Management fees are monthly fees that we collect from owners of facilities
for which we are the manager. Management fees typically range from 2.8% to 5.0% of the facility&#146;s
total gross revenues. All management fees are recognized as revenues when services are provided.
For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we earned approximately $3.9&nbsp;million, $3.5
million and $5.4&nbsp;million, respectively, in management fee revenue. Management fee revenues have
declined since 2003 primarily due to the lease of the 14 facilities from Ventas during the quarter
ended March&nbsp;31, 2004, that were previously managed by us, partially offset by the additional nine
facilities for which we took over management in August and December&nbsp;2004.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of our management agreements generally range from one to three years and can be
cancelled by the property owners for cause, sale of the facility or upon 30 to 60&nbsp;days&#146; notice at
renewal.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We classify our operating expenses into the following categories: (i)&nbsp;facility operating
expenses, which include labor, food, marketing and other direct facility expenses, insurance and
real estate taxes; (ii)&nbsp;general and administrative expenses, which primarily include the cost to
staff and maintain our corporate headquarters, our regional and divisional operating infrastructure
and other overhead costs; (iii)&nbsp;facility lease payments; and (iv)&nbsp;depreciation and amortization.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Alterra Reorganization</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second half of 2000, two issues emerged that had a materially adverse effect on
Alterra&#146;s liquidity. First, costs associated with operating Alterra&#146;s residences, labor and
liability insurance costs in particular, increased significantly in the second half of 2000. Labor
costs increased due to an increase in demand for skilled nursing professionals and an overall low
unemployment rate. The costs of obtaining liability insurance increased due to an increase in the
number of professional liability claims. Second, due both to a generally unfavorable financing
market for assisted living residences and the declining credit fundamentals at both the residence
and corporate level, Alterra was unable to complete its anticipated financing transactions in 2000
and 2001. Declining credit fundamentals relates to a reduction in Alterra&#146;s liquidity position and
negative equity value caused by its inability to meet the projections in its business plan. These
declining credit fundamentals and its assessment of future market conditions caused management to
decide to reorganize its business under Chapter&nbsp;11 (as discussed below). Throughout 2000 and 2001,
Alterra sought to implement several strategic initiatives designed to strengthen its balance sheet
and to enable management to focus on

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">stabilizing and enhancing its core business operations. The principal components of these
strategic initiatives included: (i)&nbsp;discontinuing its development activity; (ii)&nbsp;reducing its use
of and reliance upon joint venture arrangements; (iii)&nbsp;reducing the amount of outstanding debt; and
(iv)&nbsp;focusing on improving its cash flow.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;22, 2003, Alterra filed a voluntary petition with the Bankruptcy Court to
reorganize under Chapter&nbsp;11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Alterra believed that its Chapter&nbsp;11 Filing was
an appropriate and necessary step to conclude its reorganization initiatives commenced in 2001.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;26, 2003, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware entered
an order confirming Alterra&#146;s Second Amended Plan of Reorganization, or the Plan. Alterra executed
an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with FEBC-ALT Investors pursuant to which
FEBC-ALT Investors purchased 100% of the common stock of Alterra upon emergence from the Chapter&nbsp;11
bankruptcy proceeding. FEBC-ALT Investors is a limited liability company with the following
members: FIT-ALT Investor LLC, an affiliate of Fortress, or FIT-ALT Investor; Emeritus; NW Select;
and certain members of our management. Prior to Alterra&#146;s bankruptcy, there was no relationship
between Alterra and Emeritus, NW Select or Fortress. However, Daniel R. Baty, an affiliate of
Emeritus and NW Select, through his affiliates, participated in an investment in convertible debt
of Alterra prior to the bankruptcy which was expunged in the bankruptcy proceedings. Pursuant to
the Merger Agreement, FEBC-ALT Investors was capitalized with $76.0&nbsp;million, including (i)&nbsp;a $15.0
million senior loan to FEBC-ALT Investors from an affiliate of Fortress Investment Trust II, or FIT
II, a private equity fund, and (ii) $61.0&nbsp;million of aggregate equity contributions. FIT II
provided approximately 75% of the equity investment to FEBC-ALT Investors and was entitled to
appoint a majority of the directors of Alterra. Emeritus and NW Select provided the remaining
equity capital to FEBC-ALT Investors and each was entitled to appoint one director. The merger
consideration was used to fund (i)&nbsp;costs of Alterra&#146;s bankruptcy and reorganization and to provide
for the working capital and other cash needs of Alterra and (ii)&nbsp;a distribution to the unsecured
creditors. In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Emeritus and FIT II delivered
a Payment Guaranty to Alterra pursuant to which Emeritus and FIT II guaranteed up to $6.9&nbsp;million
and $69.1&nbsp;million, respectively, of the merger consideration.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alterra emerged from bankruptcy on December&nbsp;4, 2003, which we refer to as the Effective Date.
Since FEBC-ALT Investors purchased Alterra in December&nbsp;2003, a number of actions have been taken in
an effort to resolve the issues which led to Alterra&#146;s bankruptcy filing. These actions included,
but were not limited to, (i)&nbsp;implementing the various strategic initiatives that were begun by
management in 2000 and 2001 described above, (ii)&nbsp;selling or otherwise disposing of more than 200
facilities and vacant land parcels that either generated negative cash flow or were in
non-strategic markets (with the proceeds from most of these sales being used to pay down existing
debt or reduce other liabilities), and (iii)&nbsp;reducing recurring general and administrative
expenses. We believe these initiatives have adequately addressed the problems that resulted in the
bankruptcy.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, Alterra was a publicly traded company. Public
holders of Alterra&#146;s common stock prior to Alterra&#146;s bankruptcy received no payment or equity
interest in exchange for their common stock following the company&#146;s emergence from bankruptcy.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the maximum distribution to holders of unsecured claims was
approximately $23.0&nbsp;million (which includes payments pursuant to settlement agreements with holders
of deficiency claims), which was to be adjusted pursuant to the Merger Agreement based on working
capital and the cash requirements of the Plan through the Effective Date. Alterra has distributed
all of the approximately $23.0&nbsp;million. Certain liabilities deemed subject to compromise were
subsequently repaid by Alterra, pursuant to the Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working capital settlement between Alterra and the committee of unsecured creditors was
finalized and approved by the Bankruptcy Court on December&nbsp;29, 2004, for a total fixed
distributable amount of $2.5&nbsp;million. Through December&nbsp;31, 2005, $1.0&nbsp;million has been distributed.
Payment of the remaining $1.5&nbsp;million distributable amount was made on March&nbsp;14, 2006, when all
unsecured claims were determined and liquidated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Effective Date, Alterra adopted fresh start accounting pursuant to the guidance
provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountant&#146;s Statement of Position (SOP)
90-7, <I>Financial Reporting</I>

Alterra adopted the provisions of fresh start accounting effective December&nbsp;1, 2003. In accordance

the cash amount paid for all of the outstanding common stock of post-bankruptcy Alterra plus the
post-emergence liabilities existing at the reorganization date of December&nbsp;4, 2003. To the extent
the fair value of its tangible and identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities, exceeded the
reorganization value, the excess was recorded as a reduction of the amount allocated to property,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Acquisitions and Dispositions</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our financial results are impacted by the timing, size and number of acquisitions, leases and
sale-leasebacks we complete in a period. Since January&nbsp;2001, the number of facilities we owned or
leased increased by 43, which resulted in an increase of approximately 8,500 units/beds, for an
aggregate purchase price or lease value of approximately $819.4&nbsp;million (including two facilities
held for sale, which were sold at no gain or loss on July&nbsp;1, 2005 and September&nbsp;14, 2005 for $2.5
million and $9.0&nbsp;million, respectively). During this time period, we managed an additional 14
facilities with approximately 2,800 units/beds for a total of 57 facilities with approximately
10,900 units/beds that we began to own, lease or manage since January&nbsp;2001.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;28, 2006, we acquired two facilities in Orlando, Florida (114 units/beds) from
Orlando Madison Ivy, LLC for an aggregate purchase price of $13.0&nbsp;million. In connection with the
acquisition, we obtained an $8.8&nbsp;million first mortgage bearing interest at a variable rate of
LIBOR plus 1.70%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;30, 2005, we completed the acquisition of all of the shares of capital stock of
CMCP Properties Inc. from Capstead Mortgage Corporation, or Capstead. The purchase was structured
as a stock transaction, at a total cost of $181&nbsp;million, consisting of a $57.5&nbsp;million cash payment
and assumption of $119.8&nbsp;million of debt. At closing we obtained a $30.0&nbsp;million first mortgage
loan against one of the facilities bearing interest at 6.085% payable interest only until February,
2011 and principal and interest thereafter until maturity in February, 2013 and we repaid an
existing $19.0&nbsp;million loan against the facility. In connection with the refinancing we incurred a
loss on extinguishment of $2.5&nbsp;million. The portfolio is comprised of six independent and assisted
living facilities, containing a total of 1,394 units and is located in Florida, Georgia, Virginia,
Ohio and Texas (the &#147;CMCP Properties&#148;). Subsidiaries of BLC have leased and operated the facilities
since May&nbsp;1, 2002.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;22, 2005, we acquired four assisted living facilities (187 units/beds) from
Merrill Gardens for an aggregate purchase price of $16.3&nbsp;million. On November&nbsp;30, 2005, we
completed our acquisition of six facilities (237 units/beds) from Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc
(&#147;Omega&#148;) pursuant to our exercise of a purchase option, for an aggregate purchase price of $20.4
million. These acquisitions were financed by $24.0&nbsp;million of first mortgage financing bearing
interest at LIBOR plus 1.70%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2004, we completed a sale-leaseback with Provident Senior Living
Trust, or Provident, whereby we sold 68 facilities (which included 6,819 units/beds) to Provident
for an aggregate sales price of $982.8&nbsp;million and leased the facilities back through October&nbsp;31,
2019 and December&nbsp;31, 2019 with extension rights at our option. On June&nbsp;7, 2005, Ventas announced
that it had completed the acquisition of Provident pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of April&nbsp;12, 2005, under which Provident was merged with and into a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Ventas.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of 2004, the limited partnerships that owned 14 facilities in which
our subsidiaries had general and limited partnership interests sold these facilities to affiliates
of Ventas for an aggregate sales price of $114.6&nbsp;million. Ventas also acquired another facility
from a third party in a separate transaction. Simultaneously with such sales, certain of our
subsidiaries entered into agreements to lease the 15 facilities (which included 2,215 units/beds)
from Ventas pursuant to either a master lease or individual leases (collectively, the Ventas
Leases).

551 units/beds, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Financial Developments</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are certain changes in our financial results that have occurred or that we
expect to occur in 2006 and beyond, as compared to our 2005 results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a new public company, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant legal,
accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company related to corporate
governance, Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, reporting requirements under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and compliance with the various provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In particular, we expect to incur significant incremental
expenses associated with Sarbanes-Oxley Section&nbsp;404 compliance documentation and remediation. In
addition, as a New York Stock Exchange-listed company, we were required to establish an internal
audit function, and did so, on an outsourced basis. As a result, we will incur additional cost
associated with this function. We also expect these new rules and regulations to make it more
difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may
be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. We
expect the legal, accounting and other expenses that we will incur as a public company to result in
general and administrative costs of approximately $4.1&nbsp;million in 2006 and approximately $2.5
million thereafter on an annual basis. We expect to fund these additional costs using cash flows
from operations and from financing activities such as this offering and additional indebtedness,
including availability under our expected lines of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, our facilities were 89.8% occupied. We expect to maintain and
increase these occupancy levels due to the projected demand for senior living services; however,
there can be no assurance that we will maintain or increase this occupancy level or the resident
fees we charge for our services. Due to the stable nature of our portfolio, we do not expect to add
significant personnel to our facilities as occupancy increases; however, we are subject to wage and
benefit cost increases as we strive to attract and retain skilled management and staff at our
facilities. In addition, we are subject to increases in other operating expenses such as: real
estate taxes, as the taxing authorities are under increasing pressure to raise revenues; utilities,
as a result of the recent oil shortages and supply problems; and insurance costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General and administrative costs have increased primarily due to the inclusion of Alterra in
our operations, effective December&nbsp;1, 2003, and the increase in the number of properties we own,
lease and manage. During 2005, we purchased the Fortress CCRC Portfolio (eight facilities with
3,238 units/beds of which 817 are resident-owned cottages managed by us; we sold two of these
facilities in the third quarter of 2005, one of which we continued to manage through January&nbsp;2006),
we purchased the Prudential Portfolio (nine facilities with 1,261 units/beds), we purchased six
facilities (1,394/beds) from Capstead that we previously leased, we purchased four facilities (187
units/beds) from Merrill Gardens, and we purchased six facilities (237 units/beds) from Omega that
we previously leased. These acquisitions, excluding the Capstead and Omega acquisitions, required
us to add incremental corporate staff to oversee these facilities, and we expect to incur similar
incremental and general and administrative costs in the future as we acquire additional senior
housing facilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically we have leased facilities under long-term leases. We intend to finance our future
acquisitions primarily through a combination of traditional mortgage debt and equity and to reduce
our use of sale-leaseback transactions. As a result, we expect the overall percentage of our
revenues derived from our leased portfolio to decline. From a business standpoint, there is no
fundamental difference in the way we manage the operations of our leased versus owned facilities,
while from a financial standpoint, financing future acquisitions with traditional mortgage
financing and equity is expected to generate more cash flow to distribute to our stockholders and
the opportunity to generate additional proceeds from future refinancing opportunities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the fact that we are an acquisition-focused company, as we evaluate operating companies
and facilities for potential acquisition, we incur costs both internally and for various third
parties&#146; assistance, including in connection with due diligence, negotiation and structuring of
these acquisitions. These third
party costs are capitalized once the acquisition is deemed probable. If an acquisition is
abandoned, these

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total revenues increased primarily due to increased resident fees of approximately $129.4

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resident fees increased by approximately $39.0&nbsp;million, or 5.9%, at the 347 facilities we
operated during both periods which includes the lease-up of four facilities. The remaining
increase in resident fee revenue was primarily due to the addition of the Fortress CCRC Portfolio,
the Prudential Portfolio and the Merrill Gardens facilities into our operations effective April,
June/July, and December&nbsp;2005, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brookdale Living revenue increased $102.0&nbsp;million, or 38.7%, primarily due to the addition of
the Fortress CCRC Portfolio, the Prudential Portfolio and the Merrill Gardens facilities into our
operations effective April, June/July and December&nbsp;2005, respectively, and the 15 facilities leased
from Ventas in January through March and May&nbsp;2004. The inclusion of these facilities offset
increases in occupancy and average rate for the 34 facilities operated in the same period in the
prior year. The Fortress CCRC Portfolio has a lower average rate as the independent living
units/beds at three facilities charge an entrance fee which is deferred and amortized over the
expected stay of the resident.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alterra revenue increased $27.4&nbsp;million, or 6.9%, primarily due to a 2.8% increase in average
occupancy and a 3.8% increase in average monthly rent per unit/bed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed below, we had a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $9.2&nbsp;million for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net cash provided by operating activities was $16.9&nbsp;million and $50.1&nbsp;million for the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease of $33.2&nbsp;million was primarily due to
the increase in lease expense as a result of the Provident sale-leaseback transactions completed in
the fourth quarter of 2004, which was partially offset by improved operations and reduction in debt
service as a result of the Provident transaction. Changes in current assets and current liabilities
primarily relate to the timing of collections of resident fees and payment of operating expenses,
including salaries and wages, real estate taxes and insurance.

we used $595.3&nbsp;million to purchase the Fortress CCRC, Prudential, Capstead, Omega and Merrill
Gardens Portfolios, respectively, and to fund capital improvements at our existing facilities.
During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 we received $13.0&nbsp;million in distributions and proceeds
from the sale of the Grand Court partnerships&#146; facilities, $520.0&nbsp;million in sale proceeds from the
sale and leaseback of the Provident facilities and $24.0&nbsp;million from the sale of property, plant
and equipment, offset by a cash outflow of $38.0&nbsp;million for additions to property, plant and
equipment.

for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2005, we received $151.8&nbsp;million from issuance of common stock from our initial public offering,
$522.8&nbsp;million of net proceeds from debt primarily as a result of the debt incurred in connection
with the purchase of the Fortress CCRC, Prudential, Capstead, Omega and Merrill Gardens Portfolios
and refinancing of the five development facilities and $196.7&nbsp;million of equity contributed by
Fortress in connection with the purchase of the Fortress CCRC Portfolio and the Prudential
Portfolio, partially offset by the repayment of $260.0&nbsp;million of debt payment of a $20.0&nbsp;million
dividend to Fortress by Alterra and payment of a $14.4&nbsp;million dividend in October&nbsp;2005. During the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, we used $312.4&nbsp;million primarily to repay debt.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date we have financed our operations primarily with cash generated from operations, both
short- and long-term borrowings and proceeds from our sale-leaseback transaction completed in the
fourth quarter of 2004. We financed the acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2005 with
long-term borrowings, equity contributed by Fortress, and proceeds from the initial public
offering. In connection with the formation transactions Fortress contributed the Prudential

and a $60.0&nbsp;million letters of credit commitment. See &#147;New Credit Facility&#148; below.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our liquidity requirements have historically arisen from, and we expect they will continue to
arise from, working capital, general and administrative costs, debt service and lease payments,
acquisition costs, employee compensation and related benefits, capital improvements and dividend
payments. In the past, we have met our cash requirements for operations using cash flows from
operating revenues, the receipt of resident fees and the receipt of management fees from
third-party-managed facilities. In addition to using cash flows from operating revenues, we use
available funds from our indebtedness and long-term leasing of our facilities to meet our cash
obligations. Over 96% of our resident fee revenues are generated from private pay residents with
less than 4% of our resident fee revenues coming from reimbursement programs such as Medicare and
Medicaid. The primary use of our cash is for operating costs, which includes debt service and lease
payments and capital expenditures. We currently estimate that our existing cash flows from
operations, together with existing working capital, asset sales and the credit facility we recently
entered into will be sufficient to fund our short-term liquidity needs. In addition to normal
recurring capital expenditures of $12.6&nbsp;million, net of reimbursements, we expect to spend
approximately $15.4&nbsp;million for major improvements at the six Fortress CCRC Portfolio and several
existing Alterra facilities that we own. The source of these funds is the prior sale of two
Fortress CCRC facilities for $11.5&nbsp;million in the aggregate, before closing costs, during the third
quarter of 2005 and cash on hand and generated from operations and financings. There can be no
assurance that financing or refinancing will be available to us or available on acceptable terms.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect to fund the growth of our business through cash flows from operations and cash flows
from financing activities, such as equity offerings, and through the incurrence of additional
indebtedness or leasing arrangements. We expect to assess our financing alternatives periodically
and access the capital markets opportunistically. If our existing resources are insufficient to
satisfy our liquidity requirements, or if we enter into an acquisition or strategic arrangement
with another company, we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities. Any such sale of
additional equity securities will dilute the interests of our existing stockholders, and we cannot
be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms
acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain this additional financing, we may be
required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more aspects of our business
development activities, which could harm the growth of our business. At December&nbsp;31, 2005, we had
approximately $77.7&nbsp;million in cash and cash equivalents. We may incur additional indebtedness or
lease financing to fund such acquisitions. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness or
lease financing to fund future dividends.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our actual liquidity and capital funding requirements depend on numerous factors, including
our operating results, our ability to acquire new facilities, general economic conditions and the
cost of capital.

31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts exclude cash and investments-restricted and
lease security deposits totaling $86.7&nbsp;million, $74.2&nbsp;million and $61.6&nbsp;million, respectively,
escrowed pursuant to the terms of our indebtedness, leases, residency agreements and insurance
programs. Restricted cash amounts are generally available to pay real estate taxes and insurance
premiums, reimbursements of capital improvements and refundable tenant security deposits, and to
collateralize our debt, lease and self-insured retention obligations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;10, 2006, we entered into a $330.0&nbsp;million credit agreement (the &#147;Credit
Agreement&#148;), consisting of a $250.0&nbsp;million term loan, a $20.0&nbsp;million revolving loan and a $60.0
million letters of credit commitment, with the several lenders from time to time parties thereto,
Lehman Brothers Inc., as lead arranger, LaSalle Bank National Association, as syndication agent,
Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Citicorp North America, Inc.,
and LaSalle Bank National Association, as co-arrangers, Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. and
Citicorp North America, Inc., as co-documentation agents and Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as
administrative agent. Concurrent with the Credit Agreement we terminated our existing line of
credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Credit Agreement, we and certain of our subsidiaries (the &#147;Guarantors&#148;)
made a Guarantee and Pledge Agreement (the &#147;Guarantee and Pledge Agreement&#148;) in favor of Lehman
Commercial Paper Inc., as administrative agent for the banks and other financial institutions from
time to time parties to the Credit Agreement, pursuant to which certain of the Guarantors guarantee
the prompt and complete payment and performance when due by us of our obligations under the Credit
Agreement and certain of the Guarantors pledge certain assets for the benefit of the secured
parties as collateral security for the payment and performance of our obligations under the Credit
Agreement and under the guarantee. The pledged assets include, among other things, equity
interests in certain of our subsidiaries, all related books and records and, to the extent not
otherwise included, all proceeds and products of any and all of the foregoing, all supporting
obligations in respect of any of the foregoing and all collateral security and guarantees given by
any person with respect to any of the foregoing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term loan under the Credit Agreement and the revolving loan and the letters of credit
commitment is scheduled to expire on February&nbsp;10, 2007. We have the option of requesting a
six-month extension of any or all of the maturity or expiration dates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our option, the term loan and the revolving loan bear interest at either (i)&nbsp;the greater of
(a)&nbsp;the prime lending rate as set forth on the British Banking Association Telerate Page 5 plus a
margin of 0.50% and (b)&nbsp;the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus <FONT style="font-size: 70%"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>/<FONT style="font-size: 60%">2</FONT> of 1% plus a margin of 0.50%, or
(ii)&nbsp;the Eurodollar rate plus a margin of 1.50%. In connection with the revolving loan and the
letters of credit commitment, we will pay a commitment fee of 0.25% per annum on the average daily
amount of undrawn funds. In connection with the term loan, we will pay a commitment fee of 0.125%
of the average daily amount of undrawn funds so long as we draw less than $150.0&nbsp;million, or 0.25%
if we draw $150.0&nbsp;million or more.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proceeds of the loans under the Credit Agreement shall be used to finance a portion of
acquisitions of fee-simple and leasehold and stock ownership interests in senior housing real
estate and to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. The letters of
credit shall be used for the purpose of securing the payment obligation of us which could properly
be paid from the proceeds of the loans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit Agreement contains typical representations and covenants for loans of this type. A
violation of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement, which
would result in termination of all commitments and loans under the Credit Agreement and all other
amounts owing under the Credit Agreement and other loan and lease agreements to become immediately

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, our outstanding property-specific debt was
approximately $754.3&nbsp;million, $371.1&nbsp;million and $1029.3&nbsp;million, respectively. The increase from
December&nbsp;31, 2004 to December&nbsp;31, 2005 was primarily due to debt incurred to fund the acquisition
of the Fortress CCRC, Prudential, Capstead, Omega and Merrill Gardens Portfolios and the
refinancing of our $182.0&nbsp;million Guaranty Bank loan, partially offset by scheduled principal
payments and repayment of debt from the proceeds of our initial public offering. The decrease from
December&nbsp;31, 2003 to December&nbsp;31, 2004, was primarily due to the assumption by Provident of
approximately $483.3&nbsp;million of indebtedness, including first mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and
an unsecured line of credit, in connection with the Provident sale-leaseback and net repayment of
approximately $232.5&nbsp;million of indebtedness, including $19.4&nbsp;million of loans to the members of
Fortress Brookdale Acquisition LLC.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;10, 2006, we entered into a new Credit Agreement. See &#147;New Credit Facility&#148;
above.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had an unsecured line of credit of $23.5&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2005, of which $13.5
million was restricted for certain letters of credit and bore interest at the prime rate plus
1.00%. Of the balance, $7.4&nbsp;million was in the form of outstanding letters of credit for a security
deposit under leases with Ventas, which left an available balance of $2.6&nbsp;million. As of December
31, 2005, we had no outstanding borrowings (excluding letters of credit) on our unsecured line of
credit. In connection with the Credit Agreement we terminated our line of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;30, 2005, we refinanced the construction loans secured by five facilities with new
construction loans in the aggregate amount of $182.0&nbsp;million, bearing interest at 30-day LIBOR plus
3.05% to 5.60% (with a weighted average of 3.50%), payable in monthly installments of interest only
through the maturity of April&nbsp;1, 2008. The loans can be extended for two additional one-year terms
(subject to certain performance covenants and payment of an annual extension fee of 0.25% of the
amount outstanding). Upon completion of our initial public offering, we repaid $32.0&nbsp;million of
this loan that bore interest at LIBOR plus 5.60%. The remaining loan bears interest at LIBOR plus
3.05%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have secured our self-insured retention risk under our workers&#146; compensation and general
liability and professional liability programs and our lease security deposits with $42.3&nbsp;million
and $6.6&nbsp;million, respectively, of cash and letters of credit at December&nbsp;31, 2005.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, we are in compliance with the financial covenants of our outstanding
debt, including those covenants measuring facility operating income to gauge debt coverage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Long-term Leases</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have historically financed our acquisitions and current portfolio with a combination of
mortgage financing and long-term leases. During 2004, we entered into two long-term leases with
Ventas and Provident (which was acquired by Ventas in June&nbsp;2005). In connection with the leases, we
substantially reduced our outstanding debt during 2004 by $483.3&nbsp;million. Our strategy going
forward is to finance acquisitions through traditional mortgage financing of up to 65% of the cost
of a facility, with the balance in the form of our equity. The source of equity is expected to be
from current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, lines of credit,
refinancing of our existing facilities, joint ventures or additional equity offerings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, we have 295 facilities under long-term leases. Our lessors invested a
total of $1,705.6&nbsp;million in the facilities we lease from them. The leased facilities are generally
fixed rate leases with annual escalators that are either fixed or tied to the consumer price index.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following two leases have or had a floating-rate debt component built into the lease
payment:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We acquired the Chambrel portfolio from Capstead on December&nbsp;30, 2005. Prior to the
acquisition, the Chambrel portfolio lease payment was a pass through of debt service, which
includes $100.8&nbsp;million of floating rate tax-exempt debt that is credit enhanced by Fannie Mae and
subject to interest rate caps at 6.0% and $18.9&nbsp;million of fixed rate debt, and a stated equity
return subject to annual escalation based on the CPI.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Brookdale Provident leases contain $109.7&nbsp;million of variable rate mortgages, which
includes $80.0&nbsp;million of floating-rate tax-exempt debt that is credit enhanced by Freddie Mac. The
payments under the lease are subject to interest rate caps with a weighted-average rate of 6.39%.
$24.5&nbsp;million is hedged by an interest rate swap of 4.4% and the balance of $5.2&nbsp;million is
unhedged and matures in May&nbsp;2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, our minimum annual lease payments for our capital and
financing leases and operating leases was $8.0&nbsp;million and $173.5&nbsp;million, respectively. This
amount excludes the straight-line rent expense associated with our annual escalators and the
amortization of the deferred gains recognized in connection with the sale-leasebacks.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, our minimum annual lease payments for our capital and
financing leases and operating leases was $7.9&nbsp;million and $169.3&nbsp;million, respectively. This
amount excludes the straight-line rent expense associated with our annual escalators and the
amortization of the deferred gains recognized in connection with the sale-leasebacks.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, we are in compliance with the financial covenants of our capital and
operating leases, including those covenants measuring facility operating income to gauge debt
coverage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Hedging</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had one interest rate swap agreement with Firstar Bank, N.A. (now doing business as US Bank
Corp.) that converts $37.3&nbsp;million of its floating-rate construction debt to a fixed-rate basis of
5.19% through maturity on April&nbsp;1, 2005. This interest rate swap agreement was designated as a
fair value hedge. The market value of the fair value hedge at December&nbsp;31, 2004 was a liability of
$0.2&nbsp;million, which is included in other current liabilities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had four 10-year forward interest rate swaps with LaSalle Bank, N.A. to fix $97.3&nbsp;million
of future mortgage debt at 7.03%-7.325% with maturity dates ranging from August&nbsp;2012 to March&nbsp;2013.
In May&nbsp;2004, we extended the termination dates of these swaps to June&nbsp;2006. The terms of the
forward interest rate swaps required us to pay a fixed-interest rate to the counterparties and to
receive a variable rate from the counterparties. The fair value of the forward interest rate swaps
at December&nbsp;31, 2004 was a liability of $17.9&nbsp;million. Included in cash and investments-restricted
at December&nbsp;31, 2004 is a deposit of $8.0&nbsp;million to collateralize our swap obligations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;30, 2005, we terminated our four 10-year forward interest rate swaps and incurred a
termination payment of $15.8&nbsp;million, including accrued interest of $1.7&nbsp;million, which was funded
by a $10.0&nbsp;million unsecured loan bearing interest payable monthly at prime plus 1% and principal
payable in quarterly installments of $500 commencing July&nbsp;1, 2005 and maturing March&nbsp;31, 2007. The
loan was repaid in November&nbsp;2005 from the proceeds of our initial public offering.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had interest rate caps with notional amounts of approximately $62.3&nbsp;million and
approximately $15.0&nbsp;million and strike prices of 6.35% and 6.58% that expired at June&nbsp;1, 2009 and
December&nbsp;1, 2004, respectively. The interest rate caps were assigned to Provident in October&nbsp;2004.
Pursuant to the terms of our lease with Provident, the floating rate adjustment we are required to
pay is limited to the rate under the assumed interest rate caps.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the funding of $182.0&nbsp;million of loans secured by five facilities on March
30, 2005, we entered into interest rate swaps for a notional amount of $182.0&nbsp;million to hedge the
floating rate debt and lease payments where we pay an average fixed rate of 4.64% and receive
30-day LIBOR from the counterparty. The interest rate swaps are comprised of a $145.0&nbsp;million
notional amount for seven years and a $37.0&nbsp;million notional amount for three years. In connection
with the swaps, we posted approximately $2.3&nbsp;million as cash collateral with the counterparty,
which was returned in March&nbsp;2006, and are required to post additional cash collateral based on
changes in the fair value of the swaps. The swaps are recorded as
cash flow hedges. Upon completion of our initial public offering, we
repaid the $32.0&nbsp;million series&nbsp;B portion of the
$182.0&nbsp;million loan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;28, 2005, we entered into a seven-year $70.0&nbsp;million interest rate swap with Merrill
Lynch Capital Services, Inc., to hedge Alterra&#146;s $72.2&nbsp;million floating rate debt, pursuant to
which we pay a fixed rate of 4.70% and receive 30-day LIBOR. The swap is treated as a cash flow
hedge.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2005, in connection with the acquisition of the Prudential Portfolio, we entered into
a $170.0&nbsp;million five-year forward interest rate swap with Merrill Lynch Capital Services Inc. to
hedge the anticipated floating-rate debt under which we paid 4.6375% and received 30-day LIBOR from
the counterparty. In connection with the acquisition of eight facilities in June&nbsp;2005 and one
facility in July&nbsp;2005, we obtained fixed-rate debt and terminated $151.0&nbsp;million and $19.0&nbsp;million
of the forward interest rate swap and paid $2.4&nbsp;million and $0.2&nbsp;million, respectively. The
termination of the loan is recorded as a component of other comprehensive loss and amortized as
additional interest expense over the term of the debt.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the purchase of the Chambrel portfolio we assumed interest rate caps with
an aggregate notional amount of $100.8&nbsp;million, a strike price of 6.0% and a maturity date of
November/December&nbsp;2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2004, in connection with the acquisition of the Fortress CCRC Portfolio, we
entered into a $120.0&nbsp;million three-year forward interest rate swap of which $12.0&nbsp;million is
amortizing to hedge floating-rate debt where we pay 3.615% and receive 30-day LIBOR from the
counterparty. In connection with the acquisition, we obtained $105.8&nbsp;million of first mortgage
debt. Accordingly, $105.8&nbsp;million of the interest rate swap is treated as a cash flow hedge with
fair value adjustments recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in the combined
balance sheet and $2.2&nbsp;million is marked to market and recorded as an adjustment to income. In
December&nbsp;2005, we redesignated $12.0&nbsp;million of the forward interest rate swap to our Omega
Portfolio debt, this swap was recorded as a cash flow hedge.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2005, we had interest swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $370.0
million and a fair value of $4.0&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2006, we entered into five-year forward interest rate swaps in the aggregate
notional amounts of $283.3&nbsp;million whereby we pay an average fixed rate of 4.97% and receive 30-day
LIBOR from the counterparty.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resident fees for the facilities we own or lease and management fees from facilities we manage

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">rates and facility occupancy rates. The rates charged are highly dependent on local market
conditions and the competitive environment in which our facilities operate. Substantially all of
our independent and assisted living residency agreements allow for adjustments in the monthly fee
payable thereunder not less frequently than 12 or 13&nbsp;months, or monthly, respectively, thereby
enabling us to seek increases in monthly fees due to inflation, increased levels of care or other
factors. Any pricing increase would be subject to market and competitive conditions and could
result in a decrease in occupancy in the facilities. We believe, however, that our ability to
periodically adjust the monthly fee serves to reduce the adverse affect of inflation. In addition,
employee compensation expense is a principal cost element of facility operations and is also
dependent upon local market conditions. There can be no assurance that resident fees will increase
or that costs will not increase due to inflation or other causes. At December&nbsp;31, 2005,
approximately $561.7&nbsp;million of our indebtedness and lease payments bore interest at floating
rates. We have mitigated $550.9&nbsp;million of our exposure to floating rates by using $370.0&nbsp;million
of interest rate swaps and $180.9&nbsp;million of interest rate caps under our lease arrangements.
Inflation, and its impact on floating interest rates, could affect the amount of interest payments
due on such debt.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses. We consider an accounting
estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the
estimate was made and changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been
selected, could have a material impact on our combined results of operations or financial
condition. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect significant
estimates and judgments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Self-Insurance Liability Accruals</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of
our business. Although we maintain general liability and professional liability insurance policies
for our owned, leased and managed facilities under a master insurance program, our current policy
provides for deductibles of $1.0&nbsp;million for each and every claim. As a result, we are effectively
self-insured for most claims. In addition, we maintain a self-insured workers compensation program
(with excess loss coverage above $0.5&nbsp;million per individual claim) and a self-insured employee
medical program (with excess loss coverage above $0.2&nbsp;million to $0.3&nbsp;million per individual
claim). We are self-insured for amounts below these excess loss coverage amounts. We review the
adequacy of our accruals related to these liabilities on an ongoing basis, using historical claims,
actuarial valuations, third-party administrator estimates, consultants, advice from legal counsel
and industry data, and adjust accruals periodically. Estimated costs related to these
self-insurance programs are accrued based on known claims and projected claims incurred but not yet
reported. Subsequent changes in actual experience are monitored and estimates are updated as
information is available.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Tax Valuation Allowance</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We account for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;109, <I>Accounting for Income Taxes</I>.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect
for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances
are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected to be
realized. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004, we have a valuation allowance against deferred tax
assets of approximately $47.5&nbsp;million and $89.3&nbsp;million, respectively. When we determine that it is
more likely than not that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in
excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made and
reflected in either income or as an adjustment to Goodwill. This determination will be made by
considering various factors, including our expected future results, that in our judgment will make
it more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Lease Accounting</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We determine whether to account for our leases as either operating or capital leases depending
on the underlying terms. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, we operated 295 facilities under long-term leases
with $1,639.3&nbsp;million of operating and $66.3&nbsp;million of capital and financing lease obligations.
The determination of this classification is complex and in certain situations requires a
significant level of judgment. Our classification criteria is based on estimates regarding the fair
value of the leased facilities, minimum lease payments, effective cost of funds, the economic life
of the facility and certain other terms in the lease agreements as stated in our consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Facilities under
operating leases are accounted for in our statement of operations as lease expenses for actual rent
paid plus or minus straight-line adjustments for fixed or estimated minimum lease escalators and
amortization of deferred gains. For facilities under capital lease and lease financing obligation
arrangements, a liability is established on our balance sheet and a corresponding long-term asset
is recorded. Lease payments are allocated between principal and interest on the remaining base
lease obligations and the lease asset is depreciated over the term of the lease. In addition, we
amortize leasehold improvements purchased during the term of the lease over the shorter of their
economic life or the lease term. Sale-leaseback transactions are recorded as lease financing
obligations when the transactions include a form of continuing involvement, such as purchase
options.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our leases provide for various additional lease payments based on changes in the
interest rates on the debt underlying the lease. All of our leases contain fixed or formula based
rent escalators. To the extent that the escalator increases are tied to a fixed index or rate,
lease payments are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. In addition,
we recognize all rent-free or rent holiday periods in operating leases on a straight-line basis
over the lease term, including the rent holiday period.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, to represent our
estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash. The allowance for doubtful
accounts was $3.0&nbsp;million and $2.9&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on an ongoing basis, using historical
payment trends, write-off experience, analyses of receivable portfolios by payor source and aging
of receivables, as well as a review of specific accounts, and adjustments are made to the allowance
as necessary. Changes in legislation are not expected to have a material impact on collections;
however, changes in economic conditions could have an impact on the collection of existing
receivable balances or future allowance considerations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, our long-lived assets were comprised primarily of
$1,408.7&nbsp;million, $523.6&nbsp;million and $1,395.3&nbsp;million, respectively, of property, plant and
equipment. In accounting for our long-lived assets, other than goodwill, we apply the provisions of
SFAS No.&nbsp;141, <I>Business Combinations</I>, and SFAS No.&nbsp;144, <I>Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets</I>. In connection with our formation transactions, for financial reporting purposes
we recorded the non-controlling stockholders&#146; interest at fair value. Goodwill associated with the
step-up was allocated to the carrying value of each facility and included in our application of the
provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;142. Beginning January&nbsp;1, 2002, we accounted for goodwill under the
provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;142, <I>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</I>. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004,
we had $65.6&nbsp;million and $9.0&nbsp;million, respectively, of goodwill.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the allocation of the purchase price of facilities to net tangible and
identified intangible assets acquired, we make estimates of the fair value of the tangible and
intangible assets using information obtained as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence,
marketing, leasing activities and independent appraisals. We allocate a portion of the purchase
price to the value of leases acquired based on the difference between the facility valued with
existing leases adjusted to market rental rates and the facility valued as if vacant.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The determination and measurement of an impairment loss under these accounting standards
requires the significant use of judgment and estimates. The determination of fair value of these

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued SFAS No.&nbsp;123
(revised), <I>Share-Based Payment</I>, which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity
exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in
which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. SFAS No.&nbsp;123R is a
revision to SFAS No.&nbsp;123 and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25, <I>Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees</I>, and its related implementation guidance. For all companies, this
Statement will require measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock
compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the employee stock options. Incremental
compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of stock awards after the grant date must
be recognized. This Statement will be effective for us as of January&nbsp;1, 2006, although early
adoption is permitted. We adopted SFAS 123R in connection with our initial stock compensation grant
of restricted stock effective August&nbsp;2005. We recorded initial compensation expense of $18.5
million, based on an offering price of $19.00 per share, for the vested shares from the date of
grant to the date of our initial public offering, and total compensation expense of $22.7&nbsp;million
was recorded as of December&nbsp;31, 2005. In addition, we paid a cash bonus of $6.4&nbsp;million to the
grantees to reimburse them for their Federal and state taxes incurred on the grant.

VIEs, of which we are the primary beneficiary. We elected to adopt FIN 46R as of December&nbsp;31, 2003
and accordingly, consolidated the entities as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 in the accompanying financial

operates two facilities, The Heritage of Southfield, Southfield, Michigan (which includes 217
units/beds) and The Devonshire of Mt. Lebanon, Mt. Lebanon (Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania (which
includes 218 units/beds). The venture partner made a first mortgage loan to a third facility owned
by us, The Heritage at Gaines Ranch, Austin, Texas (which includes 208 units/beds) and the venture
made a mezzanine loan of $12.7&nbsp;million to the entity that owns the facility. Pursuant to the terms
of the mezzanine loan, all net cash flow, including sale or refinancing proceeds, is payable to the
venture. Pursuant to the terms of the venture agreements all net cash flow, including sale or
refinancing proceeds, is distributed to the venture partner until it receives a 16% compounded
return and then net cash flow is distributed 60% to the venture partner and 40% to us. Capital
contributions, if any, are contributed 75% by the venture partner and 25% by us.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We developed and managed eight facilities for a third party. In addition, we indemnified the
owner for any federal or state tax liabilities associated with the ownership of the facilities.
Three of the facilities were purchased in 2002 and in September&nbsp;2003 they were sold or refinanced
by the joint venture described above. As described above, effective December&nbsp;31, 2003, the
remaining five facilities (which include 1,104 units/beds) were consolidated in our financial
statements pursuant to FIN 46R. Prior to purchasing and consolidating the facilities in our
financial statements, we recorded management fees of 5% &#151; 7% of gross revenues with respect to the
facilities in our combined financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As described above, on March 1 and December&nbsp;30, 2005, we purchased four and one of the five
facilities (which include 887 and 217 units/beds), respectively. Although the facilities were
consolidated effective December&nbsp;31, 2003, pursuant to FIN 46R, they were not included in our
Federal and state income tax returns until we purchased them. On March&nbsp;30, 2005, we obtained

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Management&#146;s Use of Adjusted EBITDA</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our overall financial and operating performance. We believe
this non-GAAP measure, as we have defined it, is helpful in identifying trends in our day-to-day
performance because the items excluded have little or no significance on our day-to-day operations.
This measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to
make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieve
optimal financial performance. It provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments
to current spending decisions are needed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjusted EBITDA provides us with a measure of financial performance, independent of items that
are beyond the control of management in the short-term, such as depreciation and amortization,
straight-line rent expense (income), taxation and interest expense associated with our capital
structure. This metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that
management can impact in the short-term, namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization.
Adjusted EBITDA is one of the metrics used by senior management and the board of directors to
review the financial performance of the business on a monthly basis. Adjusted EBITDA is also used
by research analysts and investors to evaluate the performance of and value companies in our
industry.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Limitations of Adjusted EBITDA</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. It should not be viewed in isolation
or as a substitute for GAAP measures of earnings. Material limitations in making the adjustments
to our earnings to calculate Adjusted EBITDA, and using this non-GAAP financial measure as compared
to GAAP net income (loss), include:

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An investor or potential investor may find this item important in evaluating our performance,
results of operations and financial position. We use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our
GAAP results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting
our business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjusted EBITDA is not an alternative to net income, income from operations or cash flows
provided by or used in operations as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. You should
not rely on Adjusted EBITDA as a substitute for any such GAAP financial measure. We strongly urge
you to review the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income (loss), along with our
consolidated and combined financial statements included below. We also strongly urge you to not
rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. In addition, because Adjusted
EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is susceptible to varying
calculations, the Adjusted EBITDA measure, as presented in this report, may differ from and may not
be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calculation of Adjusted EBITDA includes non-recurring merger and integration expenses,
acquisition transition costs and cash bonuses in connection with the restricted stock grants
totaling $12.5 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recurring capital expenditures include expenditures capitalized in accordance with GAAP that
are funded from Cash From Facility Operations. Amounts excluded from recurring capital expenditures
consist primarily of unusual or non-recurring capital items and facility purchases and/or major
renovations that are funded using financing proceeds and/or proceeds from the sale of facilities
that are held for sale.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Management&#146;s Use of Cash From Facility Operations</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use Cash From Facility Operations to assess our overall liquidity. This measure provides
an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which
are expected to facilitate meeting current financial and liquidity goals as well as to achieve
optimal financial performance. It provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments
to current spending decisions are needed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This metric measures our liquidity based on operational factors that management can impact in
the short-term, namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization. Cash From Facility
Operations is one of the metrics used by our senior management and board of directors (i)&nbsp;to review
our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness (including our credit facilities and long-term
leases), (ii)&nbsp;our ability to pay dividends to stockholders, (iii)&nbsp;our ability to make regular
recurring capital expenditures to maintain and improve our facilities on a period-to-period basis
and (iv)&nbsp;for planning purposes, including preparation of our annual budget. Our credit facility,
which we entered into on February&nbsp;10, 2006 with Lehman Brothers Inc., LaSalle Bank National
Association, Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., and Citicorp North America, Inc. contains a
concept similar to Cash From Facility Operations as part of a formula to calculate availability of
borrowing under the credit facility. In addition, our operating leases and loan agreements
generally contain provisions requiring us to make minimum annual capital expenditures. These
agreements generally require us to escrow or spend a minimum of between $250 and $450 per unit/bed
per year. Historically, we have spent in excess of these per unit/bed amounts; however, there is
no assurance that we will have funds available to escrow or spend these per unit/bed amounts in the
future. If we do not escrow or spend the required minimum annual amounts, we would be in default
of the applicable debt or lease agreement which could trigger cross default provisions in our
outstanding indebtedness and lease arrangements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Limitations of Cash From Facility Operations</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash From Facility Operations has limitations as an analytical tool. It should not be viewed
in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures of cash flow from operations. Cash From Facility
Operations does not represent cash available for dividends or discretionary expenditures, since we
may have mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures not reflected
in the measure. Material limitations in making the adjustment to our cash flow from operations to
calculate Cash From Facility Operations, and using this non-GAAP financial measure as compared to
GAAP operating cash flows, include:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe Cash From Facility Operations is useful to investors because it assists their
ability to meaningfully evaluate (1)&nbsp;our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness, including
our credit facilities and capital and financing leases, (2)&nbsp;our ability to pay dividends to
stockholders and (3)&nbsp;our ability to make regular recurring capital expenditures to maintain and
improve our facilities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash From Facility Operations is not an alternative to cash flows provided by or used in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Management&#146;s Use of Facility Operating Income</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use Facility Operating Income to assess our facility operating performance. We believe
this non-GAAP measure, as we have defined it, is helpful in identifying trends in our day-to-day
facility performance because the items excluded have little or no significance on our day-to-day
facility operations. This measure provides an assessment of revenue generation and expense
management and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate
meeting current financial goals as well as to achieve optimal facility financial performance. It
provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are
needed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facility Operating Income provides us with a measure of facility financial performance,
independent of items that are beyond the control of management in the short-term, such as
depreciation and amortization, lease expense, taxation and interest expense associated with our
capital structure. This metric measures our facility financial performance based on operational
factors that management can impact in the short-term, namely the cost structure or expenses of the
organization. Facility Operating Income is one of the metrics used by our senior management and
board of directors to review the financial performance of the business on a monthly basis.
Facility Operating Income is also used by research analysts and investors to evaluate the
performance of and value companies in our industry by investors, lenders and lessors. In addition,
Facility Operating Income is a common measure used in the industry to value the acquisition or
sales price of facilities and is used as a measure of the returns expected to be generated by a
facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of our debt and lease agreements contain covenants measuring Facility Operating
Income to gauge debt or lease coverages. The debt or lease coverage covenants are generally
calculated as facility net operating income (defined as total operating revenue less operating
expenses, all as determined on an accrual basis in accordance with GAAP). For purposes of the
coverage calculation, the lender or lessor will further require a pro forma adjustment to facility
operating income to include a management fee (generally 4%-5% of operating revenue) and an annual
capital reserve (generally $250-$450 per unit/bed). As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, we are in compliance
with the financial covenants of all of our debt and lease agreements. An investor or potential
investor may find this item important in evaluating our performance, results of operations and
financial position, particularly on a facility-by-facility basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Limitations of Facility Operating Income</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facility Operating Income has limitations as an analytical tool. It should not be viewed in
isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures of earnings. Material limitations in making the
adjustments to our earnings to calculate Facility Operating Income, and using this non-GAAP
financial measure as compared to GAAP net income (loss), include:

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are subject to market risks from changes in interest rates charged on our credit facilities
used to finance acquisitions on an interim basis, floating-rate indebtedness and lease payments
subject to floating rates. The impact on earnings and the value of our long-term debt and lease
payments are subject to change as a result of movements in market rates and prices. As of December
31, 2005, we had approximately $223.4&nbsp;million of long-term fixed rate debt, $464.6&nbsp;million of
long-term variable rate debt, and $66.3&nbsp;million of operating lease obligations. As of December&nbsp;31,
2005, our total fixed-rate debt and variable-rate debt outstanding had weighted-average interest
rates of 6.99%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on earnings or cash flows
since 100% of our debt and lease payments either have fixed rates or variable rates that are
subject to swap or interest rate cap agreements with major financial institutions to manage our risk.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Brookdale Senior Living, Inc.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Brookdale Senior Living, Inc.
(the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2005 and the combined balance sheet of the Brookdale Facility
Group (the &#147;Predecessor Company&#148;), as defined in Note 1, as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and the Company&#146;s
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for the period October
1, 2005 to December&nbsp;31, 2005, and the Predecessor Company&#146;s combined statements of operations,
owners&#146; equity, and cash flows from the period January&nbsp;1, 2005 to September&nbsp;30, 2005, and the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed
in the index. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule
based on our audits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting
as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in Note 2 to the combined financial statements, the Predecessor Company changed
its method of accounting for variable interest entities in 2003.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December&nbsp;31, 2005 and the combined
financial position of the Predecessor Company at December&nbsp;31, 2004 and the Company&#146;s consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the period from October&nbsp;1, 2005 to December&nbsp;31, 2005 and
the Predecessor Company&#146;s combined results of operations and cash flows for the period from January
1, 2005 to September&nbsp;30, 2005 and the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;22, 2005, we consummated our initial public offering of 12,732,800 shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, consisting of 8,560,800 primary shares (including
1,660,800 shares pursuant to the option granted by us to the Underwriters to purchase up to an
additional 1,660,800 shares of common stock to cover over-allotments) and 4,172,000 shares sold by
the selling stockholders. We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling
stockholders. We received net proceeds of approximately $144.8&nbsp;million, after deducting an
aggregate of $16.9&nbsp;million in underwriting discounts and commissions paid to the underwriters and
an estimated $6.4&nbsp;million in other direct expenses incurred in connection with the offering.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the merger transaction described above, Fortress Investment Group (&#147;FIG&#148;) controlled
BLC, Alterra, FIT REN and Fortress CCRC through its ability to exercise voting, financial and
investment control over each of the entities through contractual control relationships with and
investment advisory agreements over the various entities that own the majority of BLC, Alterra, FIT
REN and Fortress CCRC.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ownership interests in BLC and Alterra representing all interests in the merger not controlled
by FIG (&#147;Non-FIG Shareholders&#148; owned approximately 10.1&nbsp;million and 4.8&nbsp;million shares of BLC and
Alterra, respectively, collectively 14.9&nbsp;million of the above shares of common stock representing
50.5% and 26.7% of BLC and Alterra, respectively, collectively 25.7% of the shares outstanding in
BSL) were adjusted for financial reporting purposes to the fair value as if their ownership
interests in BLC and Alterra were purchased by BSL as of September&nbsp;30, 2005. This results in
partial step-up to the fair value in the assets, liabilities and equity of BSL.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table summarizes the step-up in basis to reflect the fair value adjustments
relating to the ownership interests of the Non-FIG Shareholders.

based upon the fair value of underlying assets and liabilities. Current assets, certain long-term
assets, current liabilities, long-term debt and certain long-term liabilities were valued at their
historical costs since fair value approximated their costs. Property, plant and equipment, deferred
costs, goodwill, deferred gains and deferred lease liability were valued based upon our accounting
policies with regards to these asset and liability categories. Fair value for property, plant and
equipment was determined utilizing discounted cash flows derived from the operations of the
facilities owned or leased within each company. The discount rates and cap rates used in the
valuations are deemed by management to represent current market rates. Deferred costs, deferred
gains and deferred lease liability were deemed to have no fair value since there is no future
benefit or costs associated with these accounts.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2005, prior to the formation of BSL, FIT II purchased 50% of the membership
interests held by minority members for $50.0&nbsp;million. In connection with the purchase Alterra
recorded a step-up in basis of assets and liabilities related to the purchase to reflect their fair
values.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combined financial statements include the accounts of Brookdale Living Communities, Inc,
(&#147;BLC&#148;) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortress Brookdale Acquisition LLC, (&#147;FBA&#148;) and effective
December&nbsp;1, 2003, Alterra Healthcare Corporation (&#147;Alterra&#148; or &#147;Successor Alterra&#148;), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of FEBC ALT Investors, LLC (&#147;FEBC&#148;), effective April&nbsp;5, 2005, Fortress CCRC Acquisition
LLC (&#147;Fortress CCRC&#148;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortress Investment Trust II (&#147;FIT II&#148;) and
effective June&nbsp;21, 2005, FIT REN LLC (&#147;FIT REN&#148;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FIT II (collectively
referred to as the &#147;Brookdale Facility Group&#148;). All entities are indirectly controlled by
affiliates of FIG and as such are presented on a combined basis due to their common control.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These combined statements are presented on a combined basis due to that fact that FIG
controlled each of BLC, Alterra, Fortress CCRC and FIT REN through its voting, financial and
investment control over Fortress Registered Investment Trust (&#147;FRIT&#148;) and FIT II. FRIT owned 50.51%
of FBA, which owned 100% and 90.1% of BLC as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and August&nbsp;2005, respectively.
FIT II owned 100% of each of Fortress CCRC, FIT REN and FIT-ALT Investor LLC (&#147;FIT-ALT&#148;), which
owned 73.49% of FEBC, the indirect parent of Alterra, as of August&nbsp;2005 (as of December&nbsp;31, 2004,
FIT II owned 50% of FEBC and had the right to appoint a majority of the members of the FEBC board).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIG exercises control over FRIT and FIT II through contractual control relationships with, and
investment advisory control over, each of FRIT and FIT II. FRIT and FIT II are wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Fortress Investment Fund (&#147;FIF&#148;) and Fortress Investment Fund II (&#147;FIF II&#148;),
respectively. Pursuant to various agreements, Fortress Fund MM LLC (&#147;Fund MM&#148;) and Fortress Fund MM
II LLC (&#147;Fund MM II&#148;), as managing member of FIF and FIF II, respectively, have &#147;the full,
exclusive and absolute right, power and authority to manage and control&#148; each of FIF and FIF II,
&#147;and the property, assets, affairs, and business thereof.&#148; In addition, &#147;the formulation of
investment policy&#148; of FIF and FIF II is &#147;vested exclusively&#148; in each of Fund MM and Fund MM II, and
&#147;any and all rights, including voting rights, pertaining to any Portfolio Investments&#148; (as defined
in the agreements) &#147;may be exercised only by&#148; each of Fund MM and Fund MM II. In addition, pursuant
to these agreements, the control vested in each of Fund MM and Fund MM II is irrevocably delegated
to FIG, which serves as the managing member of each of these funds. Finally, FIG, through its
wholly-owned subsidiary, FIG Advisors LLC, further exercises control over each of FRIT and FIT II
in its capacity as investment advisor of each of these funds.

exempted partnership (&#147;Health Partners&#148;) agreed to contribute its convertible subordinated note
originally due 2009 in exchange for stock of FBA. FBA was owned by FRIT, Health Partners, Fortress

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;26, 2003, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming Alterra&#146;s Second
Amended Plan of Reorganization. Alterra executed an Agreement and Plan of Merger (&#147;Merger
Agreement&#148;) with FEBC, pursuant to which FEBC would acquire 100% of the common stock of the Company
upon emergence from the Chapter&nbsp;11 bankruptcy proceeding. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, FEBC
would pay Successor Alterra $76.0&nbsp;million of merger consideration, which may be adjusted downward
in certain circumstances. FEBC was capitalized with $76.0&nbsp;million including (i)&nbsp;a $15.0&nbsp;million
senior loan to FEBC from an affiliate of FIT II and (ii) $61.0&nbsp;million of aggregate equity
contributions. FIT II provided approximately 75% of the equity investment to FEBC and is entitled
to appoint a majority of the directors of Alterra. Emeritus Corporation and NW Select LLC provided
the remaining equity capital to FEBC and is entitled to appoint one director.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alterra emerged from bankruptcy on December&nbsp;4, 2003 (the Effective Date).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settlement between Alterra and the committee of unsecured creditors was finalized and approved
by the Bankruptcy Court on December&nbsp;29, 2004, for a total fixed distributable amount of $2.45
million. Payment of the settlement will be made when all unsecured claims are determinable and
liquidated. This settlement was included in the fresh start adjustments recognized in 2004 as an
increase in current liabilities and an increase in property, plant and equipment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Effective Date, Alterra adopted fresh start accounting pursuant to the guidance
provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountant&#146;s Statement of Position (SOP)
90-7, <I>Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code</I>. For financial
reporting purposes, Alterra adopted the provisions of fresh start accounting effective December&nbsp;1,
2003. In accordance with the principles of fresh start accounting, Alterra has adjusted its assets
and liabilities to their fair values as of December&nbsp;1, 2003. Alterra&#146;s reorganization value was
determined to be equal to the cash amount paid for all of the outstanding common stock of Alterra
plus the post-emergence liabilities existing at the reorganization date. To the extent the fair
value of its tangible and identifiable intangible assets net of liabilities exceeded the
reorganization value, the excess was recorded as a reduction of the amounts allocated to property
and equipment and leasehold intangibles.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;5, 2005, an affiliate of FIT II, Fortress CCRC, purchased eight facilities for a
combined purchase price of $210.5&nbsp;million, including closing costs and including the assumption of
$24.4&nbsp;million, of refundable entrance fee obligations, which were allocated $199.5&nbsp;million, to real
estate and $11.0&nbsp;million, to lease intangibles.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;21, 2005, FIT REN purchased eight facilities for an aggregate of $258.0&nbsp;million,
including closing costs, which was allocated as follows: $251.9&nbsp;million to real estate and $6.1
million to lease intangibles. In connection with the purchase, FIT REN obtained $151.4&nbsp;million of
first mortgage financing. Prior to the acquisition, FIT REN entered into a $170.0&nbsp;million forward
swap of which $151.0&nbsp;million was attributed to the eight facilities. At closing FIT REN terminated
$151.0&nbsp;million of the forward swap and incurred a loss of $2.4&nbsp;million. The loss is included in
other comprehensive loss and will be amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term
of the hedged debt.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;22, 2005 FIT REN acquired a ninth facility for $27.9&nbsp;million located in Santa Monica,

$0.2&nbsp;million which will be included in other comprehensive income and amortized as an adjustment to

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;). All significant

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial statements of Brookdale Facility Group (Predecessor Company) are presented on a
combined basis, in accordance with GAAP for the periods of January&nbsp;1, 2005 through September&nbsp;30,
2005 and for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003. For financial reporting purposes the
non-controlling shareholders or members (ownership interests other than those controlled by FIG)
have been presented as minority interest. Upon consummation of the proposed formation transaction,
the minority interests were consolidated as shareholders of BSL and their interest reflected at
fair value in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;141 Business Combinations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Principles of Consolidation</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued a revised
Interpretation No.&nbsp;46, <I>Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities</I>, an interpretation of ARB No.&nbsp;51
(&#147;FIN 46R&#148;). This Interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of primary
beneficiaries in variable interest entities (&#147;VIE&#148;) as defined in the Interpretation. A company
that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate the entity if its interest in
the VIE is such that it will absorb a majority of the VIE&#146;s losses and/or receive a majority of
expected residual returns, if they occur. We elected to adopt FIN 46R as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and
accordingly, consolidated the entities as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 in the accompanying financial
statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;1, 2005 and December&nbsp;30, 2005, we obtained legal title to four VIE&#146;s (The Meadows of
Glen Ellyn, The Heritage of Raleigh, Trillium Place and The Hallmark of Creve Coeur facilities) and
one VIE (the Hallmark of Battery Park City), respectively. The five VIE&#146;s were previously
consolidated pursuant to FIN 46R, the legal acquisition of the facilities had minimal accounting
impact.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equity method of accounting has been applied in the accompanying financial statements with
respect to our investment in unconsolidated ventures that are not considered VIE&#146;s as we do not

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>New Accounting Pronouncements</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)&nbsp;No.&nbsp;123
(revised), <I>Share-Based Payment</I>, which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity
exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in
which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. SFAS No.&nbsp;123R is a
revision to SFAS No.&nbsp;123 and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB)&nbsp;Opinion No.&nbsp;25,
<I>Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees</I>, and its related implementation guidance. This Statement
will require measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock
compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the employee stock options. Incremental
compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be
recognized. This Statement will be effective for us as of January&nbsp;1, 2006. We adopted SFAS 123R in
connection with the granting of our predecessors&#146; initial stock compensation grant of restricted
stock effective August&nbsp;2005 (note 15).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2005, the FASB issued EITF Issue No.&nbsp;04-05, <I>Determining Whether a General Partner, or
the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited
Partners Have Certain Rights </I>(&#145;EITF 04-05&#148;). EITF 04-05 provides guidance in determining whether a
general partner controls a limited partnership that is not a VIE and thus should consolidate the
limited partnership. The effective date is June&nbsp;29, 2005, for all new limited partnerships and
existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements are modified and no later than
the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2005 for
all other limited partnerships. We adopted EITF 04-05 effective January&nbsp;1, 2006 and do not expect
it to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosures

Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three facilities have residency agreements which require the resident to pay an upfront fee
prior to occupying the facility. Generally we have no further obligation to provide healthcare or
reduce the future monthly fee paid by the tenant. In two of our facilities a portion of the
entrance fee is refundable and a portion non-refundable. In the third facility the entrance fee is
refundable to the resident pro rata over a 67-month period.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-refundable portion of the entrance fee is recorded as deferred revenue and amortized
over the estimated stay of the resident. The refundable portion is generally refundable upon the
sale of the unit, or in certain agreements upon the resale of a comparable unit or 12&nbsp;months after
the resident vacates the unit. All refundable amounts due to residents are classified as current
liabilities.

be fully recovered through the estimated cash flows, including net sale proceeds. The amount of the
impairment loss recognized is the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair
value less costs to sell. Our policy is to consider a facility to be held for sale when we have
committed to a plan to sell such facility and active marketing activity has commenced or it is
expected to commence in the near term. Depreciation is suspended during the period the assets are

Facilities under operating leases are accounted for in our statement of operations as lease expense
for actual rent paid plus or minus a straight-line adjustment for estimated minimum lease
escalators and amortization of deferred gains in situations where sale-leaseback transactions have
occurred. For facilities under capital lease and lease financing obligation arrangements, a
liability is established on our balance sheet and a corresponding long-term asset is recorded. In
addition, we amortize leasehold improvements purchased during the term of the lease over the
shorter of their economic life or the lease term. Sale lease back transactions are recorded as
lease financing obligations when the transactions include a form of continuing involvement, such as
purchase options.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;30, 2001, BLC acquired a 45% interest in GFB-AS Investors, LLC (&#147;GFB&#148;), a Delaware
limited liability company, and GFB, in turn, acquired management contract rights, loans receivable,
and the equity interests in the general partners of various partnerships (the &#147;GC Property
Partnerships&#148;) previously owned or controlled by affiliates of Grand Court Lifestyles, Inc. Each GC
Property Partnership owns a senior housing facility (the &#147;GC Facilities&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total initial investment in GFB was $12.8&nbsp;million, of which our share was $5.7&nbsp;million. On
September&nbsp;7, 2002, GFB purchased a portion of the limited partners&#146; interests in 15 of the GC
Property Partnerships. The members contributed an additional $2.6&nbsp;million to fund these purchases
of which the Company&#146;s share was $1.1&nbsp;million. Our investment in GFB was funded from the proceeds
of a loan made by our majority shareholder which bore interest at 15% per annum. We accounted for
GFB&#146;s limited partner interests in the GC Property Partnerships under the equity method of
accounting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;29, 2003, we purchased the remaining 55% interest in GFB for $10.5&nbsp;million, all of
which was funded by additional loans made by the shareholders of FBA. The existing loan to the
majority shareholder was amended and restated in connection with the transaction and a restatement
fee (as defined) of $0.9&nbsp;million incurred and included in interest expense in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we have management consulting and supervisory
agreements with 3, 3 and 19 GC Facilities, respectively, providing for a fee payable in the amount
of 2.8% of the gross revenues. Fees from the GC Facilities totaled $0.1&nbsp;million for the three
months ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, $0.3&nbsp;million for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2005 and $0.8

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2004, 14 GC Property Partnerships in which GFB had
general and limited partnership interests, sold the facilities to Ventas, Inc. (note 9). Upon the
sale of the 14 GC Facilities and one additional GC Facility, we received approximately $9.2&nbsp;million
from our investment in loans receivable and $4.0&nbsp;million from our general and limited partnership
interests. We did not recognize any gain or loss related to these transactions.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;27, 2002, we purchased The Heritage at Gaines Ranch, a 208-unit facility located
in Austin, Texas (&#147;Austin&#148;), The Heritage of Southfield, a 217-unit facility located in Southfield,
Michigan (&#147;Southfield&#148;), and The Devonshire of Mt. Lebanon, a 218-unit facility located in Mt.
Lebanon (Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania (&#147;Mt. Lebanon&#148;) which were developed and managed for third party
owners. The total purchase price included cash of $41 plus the assumption of all liabilities,
including $76.1&nbsp;million of first mortgage loans and $13.4&nbsp;million of mezzanine financing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first mortgage notes payable totaling $76.1&nbsp;million were originally due September&nbsp;26, 2002
and March&nbsp;11, 2003. The mortgage loans were cross-collateralized and partially guaranteed by BLC.
Upon the non-payment of the mortgage loans due September&nbsp;26, 2002, the first mortgage lender
declared an event of default and accelerated the due date on the remaining loan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reached an agreement with the first mortgage lender on August&nbsp;8, 2003 to restructure the
first mortgage loans which gave us the right to payoff the first mortgage loans at an agreed upon
amount on or before December&nbsp;31, 2003. For the period November&nbsp;1, 2002, through August&nbsp;8, 2003 the
lender retained all rental receipts and we paid certain of the facilities operating expenses. The
agreement also provided, among other things, for the first mortgage lender to forbear with respect
to the acceleration notices and interest to accrue on the loan balances at the stated rate of LIBOR
plus 3%. The mezzanine loans related to the Austin and Southfield facilities also matured on
September&nbsp;26, 2002 and we reached an agreement with the subordinated lender to forbear on all
claims until February&nbsp;1, 2004.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;30, 2003, we formed the Brookdale Senior Housing, LLC joint venture (&#147;Venture&#148;)
with a third party (&#147;Venture Partner&#148;) and effectively sold 75% of our interest in the Southfield
and Mt. Lebanon facilities. The Venture owns the Southfield and Mt. Lebanon facilities and provided
mezzanine financing for the Austin facility. The Venture was capitalized with $66.3&nbsp;million of cash
of which $144 was contributed by us and the balance of $66.2&nbsp;million from the Venture Partner in
the form of $35.8&nbsp;million of equity and $30.3&nbsp;million first mortgage financing. The first mortgage
loans are secured by the Southfield and Mt. Lebanon facilities payable interest only at the rate of
6.75% through September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 7.25% through maturity on October&nbsp;1, 2009. The difference
between the carrying amount of this investment and the value of the underlying equity is amortized
as an adjustment to earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Venture made a $12.7&nbsp;million mezzanine loan to the Austin facility payable interest at the
rate of all available cash flow, as defined, and entitled the Venture to receive all appreciation
in the facility. In addition,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">the Venture Partner made a first mortgage loan of $16.4&nbsp;million secured by the Austin facility

Partner until they receive a 16% cumulative preferred return and then 60% to the Venture Partner

until they receive their cumulative preferred return; second to the venture partner until they
receive the return of their contributed equity; and then 60% to the Venture Partner and 40% to us.

the Venture, we received net proceeds of $51.6&nbsp;million, which resulted in a loss on the sale of
$24.5&nbsp;million. The Company used the proceeds to repay the existing first mortgage and mezzanine
loans on the Southfield, Mt. Lebanon and Austin facilities and recognized a gain on extinguishment
of debt of $12.5&nbsp;million, net of closing costs.

seven years and a $37.0&nbsp;million notional amount for three years. In connection with the swaps, we
posted approximately $2.3&nbsp;million as cash collateral, which was released March&nbsp;10, 2006, with the
counterparty and are required to post additional cash collateral based on changes in the fair value
of the swaps. The swaps are recorded as cash flow hedges.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;28, 2005, we entered into a seven-year $70.0&nbsp;million interest rate swap with Merrill
Lynch Capital Services, Inc., to hedge Alterra&#146;s $72.2&nbsp;million floating rate debt, pursuant to
which we pay a fixed rate of 4.70% and receive 30-day LIBOR. The interest rate swap is treated as
a cash flow hedge.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2005, in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Prudential Portfolio, we
entered into a $170.0&nbsp;million five-year forward interest rate swap to hedge the anticipated
floating-rate debt under which we paid 4.6375% and received 30-day LIBOR from the counterparty. In
connection with the acquisition of eight facilities in June&nbsp;2005 and one facility in July&nbsp;2005, we
obtained fixed-rate debt and terminated $151.0&nbsp;million and $19.0&nbsp;million of the forward interest
rate swap and paid $2.4&nbsp;million and $0.2&nbsp;million, respectively. The termination of the swap is
recorded as a component of other comprehensive loss and amortized as additional interest expense
over the term of the debt.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2004, in connection with the acquisition of the Fortress CCRC Portfolio, we
entered into a $120.0&nbsp;million three-year forward interest rate swap to hedge floating-rate debt
where we pay 3.615% and receive 30-day LIBOR from the counterparty. In connection with the
acquisition, we obtained $105.8&nbsp;million of first mortgage debt. Accordingly, $105.8&nbsp;million of the
interest rate swap is treated as a cash flow hedge with fair value adjustments recorded as a
component of other comprehensive income in the combined balance sheet and $12.2&nbsp;million is marked
to market and recorded as an adjustment to earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the purchase of the Chambrel Portfolio (note 16) we assumed interest rate
caps with an aggregate notional amount of $100.8&nbsp;million, a strike price of 6.0% and a maturity
date of November/December&nbsp;2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of the outstanding swaps are included in other current assets and other current
liabilities with the corresponding fair value included as a separate component of stockholders&#146;
equity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the three months ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2005 and for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 an adjustment to interest expense
was recorded for $(0.1)&nbsp;million, $4.0
million and $3.2&nbsp;million, respectively, the majority of which resulted from the change in the fair
value of interest rate and forward starting interest rate swaps not previously designated as
hedging instruments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2005, we have interest rate swaps outstanding with an aggregate notional
amount of $370.0&nbsp;million and a fair value of $4.0&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had interest rate caps with notional amounts of approximately $62.3&nbsp;million and approximately
$15.0&nbsp;million and strike prices of 6.35% and 6.58% that expired at June&nbsp;1, 2009 and December&nbsp;1,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As described in note 1, BSL was formed by the exchange of common shares or membership
interests in entities controlled by FIG. In connection with the transaction the assets and
liabilities of the Non-FIG Shareholders were recorded at their respective fair values for financial
reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities were recorded at carryover basis for Federal income
tax purposes. The difference between the basis recorded for financial reporting purposes and the
basis recorded for Federal income tax purposes is reflected as a deferred tax liability. As a
result of the transaction, we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will
recognize certain deferred tax assets and have adjusted our valuation allowance to $38.7&nbsp;million at
September&nbsp;30, 2005. In accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;109, the reduction in the allowance was reflected
in the fair value adjustments described in note 1. During the fourth quarter 2005, the deferred
tax assets increased $8.7&nbsp;million and the valuation allowance was increased for the same amount.
The valuation allowance is $47.5&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, BSL had operating net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$128.5&nbsp;million, which are available to offset future taxable income, if any, through 2025. The
formation of BSL constituted an ownership change under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code, as
amended. As a result, BSL&#146;s ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforward to offset future
taxable income is subject to certain limitations and restrictions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2004, BLC has net operating loss carryforwards for Federal and state income
tax purposes of approximately $13,611 and $19,331, respectively, which are available to offset
future taxable income, if any, through 2024. We have recorded a valuation allowance due to
uncertainties regarding our ability to utilize these losses in the future.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As described in note 11, in 2004 we sold the stock of BLC to Provident who assumed BLC&#146;s
income tax positions resulting in a non-taxable gain for income tax purposes. For financial
reporting purposes we recorded a deferred tax asset of $41.2&nbsp;million from the gain. Included in the
deferred gain on sale leaseback is a net deferred tax liability of $51.7&nbsp;million assumed by
Provident comprised primarily of deferred tax liabilities related to the stock sale, net of
operating loss carryforwards and related valuation allowance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with fresh start accounting, Alterra&#146;s assets and liabilities were recorded at
their respective fair market values. Deferred tax assets and liabilities were recognized for the
tax effects of the difference between the fair values and the tax bases of Alterra&#146;s assets and
liabilities. In addition, deferred tax assets were recognized for the future use of net operating
losses. The valuation allowance established to reduce deferred tax assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2004
was $28.4&nbsp;million. The reduction in this valuation allowance relating to net deferred tax items
existing at the Effective Date will increase additional paid in
capital. At December&nbsp;31,
2004, Alterra increased additional paid-in capital by $4.8&nbsp;million as a result of a reduction in
valuation allowance related to net deferred tax assets not benefited under fresh-start accounting,
but realized in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004. During 2005, Alterra reduced additional paid-in
capital by $0.9&nbsp;million due to a reversal of the valuation allowance, related to net deferred tax
asset.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reorganization of Alterra constituted an ownership change under section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code. The use of any of its net operating losses generated prior to the ownership
change that are not reduced pursuant to the provisions discussed above will be subject to an
overall annual limitation of approximately $3.6&nbsp;million. Further utilization of net operating
losses can be achieved by increasing the net operating loss limitation (under section 382) for
recognized built-in gains. During 2004, Alterra increased the section 382 limitation by $63.3
million as a result of recognizing built-in gains.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alterra has approximately $71.3&nbsp;million of net operating losses subject to the section 382
limitation and $6.2&nbsp;million of regular net operating loss carryforwards at December&nbsp;31, 2004. Any
unused net operating loss carryforwards will expire commencing in years 2021 through 2023.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have entered into sale leaseback and lease agreements with certain real estate investment
trusts (REITs). Under these agreements we either sell facilities to the REIT or enter into a
long-term lease agreement for such facilities. The lease terms vary from 10 to 20&nbsp;years and include
renewal options ranging from 5 to 30&nbsp;years. We are responsible for all operating costs, including
repairs, property taxes and insurance. The substantial majority of our lease arrangements are
structured as master leases. Under a master lease, we lease numerous facilities through an
indivisible lease. We typically guarantee our performance and the lease payments under the master
lease and are subject to net worth, minimum capital expenditure requirements per facility per annum
and minimum lease coverage ratios. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event
of default.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Ventas Portfolio</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of 2004, the limited partnerships that owned 14 GC Facilities (1,994
units), in which GFB had general and limited partnership interests, sold the facilities to Ventas,
Inc. (&#147;Ventas&#148;) and we entered into an operating lease agreement to lease the facilities from
Ventas for an initial aggregate annual lease rate of $10,598 (the &#147;Ventas Lease&#148;). The Ventas Lease
has an initial term of 15&nbsp;years with our right to extend for up to two 10-year periods and is
guaranteed by BLC. We also have the right to purchase the facilities in year 15 at the greater of
the fair market value or a stated minimum purchase price.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;13, 2004, we amended the operating lease agreement with Ventas to include a 221-unit
facility with an initial annual lease rate of $3.5&nbsp;million except that we do not have a purchase
option. On October&nbsp;19, 2004, the Ventas Lease was amended to provide for: (i)&nbsp;annual escalations
of the greater of 2.0% (increased from 1.5%) or 75% of the CPI increase and, (ii)&nbsp;a purchase option
in year 15 (from year 10) of the lease.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;19, 2004, FBA sold the stock of BLC to Provident Senior Living Trust (&#147;Provident&#148;).
On June&nbsp;7, 2005, Ventas acquired Provident. Prior to the sale, BLC distributed all the assets and
liabilities, except for the real estate of 21 owned facilities (4,474 units/beds) and related
property debt, certain other mezzanine loans and the unsecured line of credit, to a new entity
representing the continuing BLC entity. In connection with the stock sale, Provident assumed BLC&#146;s
income tax positions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October and December&nbsp;2004, Alterra sold 38 (1,732 units/beds) and nine facilities (613
units/beds), respectively, to Provident.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aggregate sales price was $982.8&nbsp;million including transaction costs, assumed debt and
other liabilities. Simultaneously with the closing, we entered into an operating lease agreements
to lease back the facilities, resulting in the gain on the sale of $130.8&nbsp;million being deferred
and amortized over the initial lease term. In addition, we recognized a gain of $1.1&nbsp;million on the
assumption of the mezzanine loans. A summary of the deferred gain is as follows:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the sale of certain facilities to Ventas Realty Limited Partnership
(&#147;Ventas&#148;) in 2004, two legal actions have been filed. The first action was filed on September&nbsp;15,
2005 by current and former limited partners in 36 investing partnerships in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of New York captioned <I>David T. Atkins et. al. v. Apollo
Real Estate Advisors, L.P., et al </I>(the &#147;Action&#148;)<I>. </I>On March&nbsp;17, 2006, a third amended complaint was
filed in the Action. The third amended complaint is brought on behalf of current and former
limited partners in 14 investing partnerships. It names as defendants, among others, the Company,
Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. (&#147;BLCI&#148;), a subsidiary of the Company, GFB-AS Investors, LLC
(&#147;GFB-AS&#148;), a subsidiary of BLCI, the general partners of the 14 investing partnerships, which are
alleged to be subsidiaries of GFB-AS, Fortress Investment Group LLC (&#147;FIG&#148;), an affiliate of our
largest stockholder, and our Chief Financial Officer. The nine count third amended complaint
alleges, among other things, (i)&nbsp;that the defendants converted for their own use the property of
the limited partners of 11 partnerships, including through the failure to obtain consents the
plaintiffs contend were required for the sale of facilities indirectly owned by those partnerships
to Ventas; (ii)&nbsp;that the defendants fraudulently persuaded the limited partners of three
partnerships to give up a valuable property right based upon incomplete, false and misleading
statements in connection with certain consent solicitations; (iii)&nbsp;that that certain defendants,
including GFB-AS, the general partners, and our Chief Financial Officer, but not including the
Company, BLCI, or FIG, committed mail fraud in connection with the sale of facilities indirectly
owned by the 14 partnerships at issue in the Action to Ventas; (iv)&nbsp;that certain defendants,
including GFB-AS and our Chief Financial Officer, but not including the Company, BLCI, the general
partners, or FIG, committed wire fraud in connection with certain communications with plaintiffs in
the Action and another investor in a limited partnership; (v)&nbsp;that the defendants, with the
exception of the Company, committed substantive violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (&#147;RICO&#148;); (vi)&nbsp;that the defendants conspired to violate RICO; (vii)&nbsp;that GFB-AS
and the general partners violated the partnership agreements of the 14 investing partnerships;
(viii)&nbsp;that GFB-AS, the general partners, and our Chief Financial Officer breached fiduciary duties
to the plaintiffs; and (ix)&nbsp;that the defendants were unjustly enriched. The plaintiffs have asked
for damages in excess of $100.0&nbsp;million on each of the counts described above, including treble
damages for the RICO claims. We intend to file a motion to dismiss the claims, and to continue to
vigorously defend this Action. A putative class action lawsuit was also filed on March&nbsp;22, 2006 by
certain limited partners in four of the same partnerships involved in the Action in the Court of
Chancery for the State of Delaware captioned <I>Edith Zimmerman et al. v. GFB-AS Investors, LLC and
Brookdale Living Communities,</I>

fiduciary duty arising out of the sale of facilities indirectly owned by the investing partnerships
to Ventas and the subsequent lease of those facilitiesby Ventas to subsidiaries of BLCI.

amounts equal to 25% of the employee&#146;s contribution to the plans. Employees are always 100% vested
in their own contributions and vest in our contributions over five years. We made contributions to
such plans in the amount of $0.7&nbsp;million for the three months ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, $0.3

addition, the management approach focuses on financial information that an enterprise&#146;s decision
makers use to make decisions about the enterprise&#146;s operating matters. We continue to evaluate the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">CCRC Portfolio and the Prudential Portfolio, and Alterra, had and has distinct chief operating
decision makers, or CODMS. Our facilities are considered separate operating segments because they
each engage inbusiness activities from which they earn revenues and incur expenses, their
operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODMS to make decisions about resources to be
allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and discrete financial information is
available.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;131 permits aggregation of operating segments that share all common operating
characteristics (similar products and services, similar methods used to deliver or provide their
products and services, and similar type and class of customer for their products and services) and
similar economic characteristics (revenue recognition and gross margin). We believe that
each of our facilities provides similar services, delivers these services in a similar manner, and
has a common type and class of customer. In addition, all of our facilities recognize and
report revenue in a similar manner. However, our individual facility gross margins vary
significantly. Therefore, we have aggregated our segments based upon the lowest common
economic characteristic of each of our facilities: gross margin. The CODMS allocate
resources in large part based on margin and analyze each of the facilities as having either (1)
less than 20% operating margins, (2)&nbsp;more than 20% operating margins but less than 40% operating
margins, or (3)&nbsp;greater than 40% operating margins. The CODMS believe that the margin is the
primary, most significant and most useful indicator of the necessary allocation of resources to
each individual facility because it is the best indicator of a facility&#146;s operating performance and
resource requirements. Accordingly, our operating segments are aggregated into six reportable
segments based on comparable operating margins within each of Brookdale Living and Alterra. We
define our operating margin for each group of facilities as that group&#146;s operating income divided
by its revenue. Operating income represents revenue less operating expenses (excluding depreciation
and amortization).

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;5, 2005, BLC and Alterra adopted employee restricted stock plans to attract,
motivate, and retain key employees. The plans provide for the grant of shares of common stock to
those participants selected by the board of directors. Upon adoption of the plans, restricted
shares of BLC and Alterra were granted to employees. At September&nbsp;30, 2005, as a result of the
formation transactions described in Note 1, these restricted shares were converted into a total of
2.6&nbsp;million shares of restricted stock in BSL at a value of $19 per share. Pursuant to the plans,
25% to 50% of each individual&#146;s award vested upon completion of the initial public offering on
November&nbsp;22, 2005. The remaining awards vest over a period of three to five years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;14, 2005, we adopted a new equity incentive plan for our employees, the Brookdale
Senior Living Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, which was approved by our stockholders on October&nbsp;14,
2005, to strengthen the commitment of our employees, motivate them to faithfully and diligently
perform their responsibilities and attract and retain competent and dedicated persons who are
essential to the success of our business and whose efforts will result in our long-term growth and
profitability. The plan provides for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted shares, deferred shares, performance shares, unrestricted shares and other stock-based
awards. While we intend to issue stock in the future to key employees as a recruiting and
retention tool, we have not established specific parameters regarding future grants of restricted
stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock has been reserved for issuance under
the plan; provided, however, that commencing on the first day of our fiscal year beginning in
calendar year 2006, the number of shares reserved and available for issuance will be increased by
an amount equal to the lesser of (1)&nbsp;400,000 shares and (2)&nbsp;2% of the number of outstanding shares
of our common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year. When Section 162(m)
of the Internal Revenue Code becomes applicable, the maximum aggregate number of shares that will
be subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights that may be granted to any individual
during any fiscal year will be 400,000, and the maximum aggregate number of shares that will be
subject to awards of restricted stock, deferred shares, unrestricted shares or other stock-based
awards that may be granted to any individual during any fiscal year will be 400,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan will initially be administered by our board of directors, although it may be
administered by either our board of directors or any committee of our board of directors, including
a committee that complies with the applicable requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code, Section&nbsp;16 of the Exchange Act and any other applicable legal or stock exchange
listing requirements.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;30, 2005, we completed the acquisition of all of the shares of capital stock of
CMCP Properties Inc. from Capstead Mortgage Corporation, or Capstead. The purchase was structured
as a stock transaction, at a total cost of $181&nbsp;million, consisting of a $57.5&nbsp;million cash payment
and assumption of $119.8&nbsp;million of debt. At closing we obtained a $30.0&nbsp;million first mortgage
loan against one of the facilities bearing interest at 6.085% payable interest only until February,
2011 and principal and interest thereafter until maturity in February, 2013 and we repaid an
existing $19.0&nbsp;million loan against the facility. In connection with the refinancing we incurred a
loss on extinguishment of $2.5&nbsp;million. The portfolio is comprised of six independent and assisted
living facilities located in Florida, Georgia, Virginia,
Ohio and Texas (the &#147;CMCP Properties&#148;). Subsidiaries of BLC have leased and operated the facilities
since May&nbsp;1, 2002.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;22, 2005, we acquired four assisted living facilities (which included 187
units/beds) from Merrill Gardens for an aggregate purchase price of $16.3&nbsp;million. The
acquisition was financed by $15.2&nbsp;million of first mortgage financing bearing interest at a
variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.70%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;30, 2005, we completed our acquisition of six facilities (which included
237 units/beds from Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc (&#147;Omega&#148;) pursuant to our exercise of a
purchase option, for an aggregate purchase price of $20.4&nbsp;million. The Merrill Gardens and Omega
acquisitions were financed by $8.8&nbsp;million of first mortgage financing bearing interest at LIBOR
plus 1.70% and $6.7&nbsp;million of the net proceeds of our initial public offering.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;21, 2005, we signed an agreement to acquire Southern
Assisted Living Inc. (SALI),
a company based in North Carolina that operates a portfolio of 41
senior living facilities, all of which are leased, for $82.9&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;12, 2006, we signed a definitive agreement to
purchase 18 owned and leased senior
living facilities from American Senior Living L.P. for $124.0&nbsp;million. The
portfolio is located in Alabama, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Ohio,
Tennessee, Virginia and Washington and is divided into seven owned and 11 leased facilities. The
transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and multiple closings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;7, 2006, we signed a definitive agreement to
acquire six properties from AEW
Capital Management for $209.5&nbsp;million. The portfolio located in California, Ohio and Washington is
comprised of six independent living, assisted living and CCRC
facilities. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and possible multiple
closings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;10, 2006, we entered into a $330.0&nbsp;million
credit agreement, consisting of a
$250.0&nbsp;million term loan available for acquisitions and an $80.0&nbsp;million revolving loan with a
$60.0&nbsp;million sublimit for letters of credit. Concurrent with the new credit agreement we
terminated our existing line of credit. The credit agreement bears interest at either prime plus
0.5% or LIBOR plus 1.50% and matures on February&nbsp;10, 2007, subject to extension at our option for
six months. In connection with the revolving loan we paid a commitment fee of 0.5% and a non-use
fee on the term loan of 0.125% of the average daily amount of undrawn funds so long as we draw less
than $150.0&nbsp;million, 0.25% if we draw $150.0&nbsp;million or more.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2006, we entered into five-year forward interest rate swaps in the aggregate
notional amounts of $283.3&nbsp;million whereby we pay an average fixed rate of 4.97% and receive 30-day
LIBOR from the counterparty.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;28, 2006, we terminated the management agreement for four facilities due to a
sale. Management fees for these four facilities was $0.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2005, and we received a termination fee of $0.2&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;28, 2006, we acquired two facilities in
Orlando, Florida from Orlando Madison Ivy, LLC. for an aggregate purchase price of $13.0&nbsp;million. In
connection with the acquisition, we obtained an $8.8&nbsp;million first mortgage bearing interest at a
variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.70%.
