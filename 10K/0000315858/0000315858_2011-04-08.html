of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), and Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. When used in

&#147;believe,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;may,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;expect&#148; and similar expressions identify certain of such
forward-looking statements. Actual results, performance, or achievements could differ materially
from those contemplated, expressed, or implied by the forward-looking statements contained herein.
These forward-looking statements are based largely on the expectations of BFC Financial

change based on factors which are, in many instances, beyond the Company&#146;s control. When
considering those forward-looking statements, the reader should keep in mind the risks,
uncertainties and other cautionary statements made in this report. The reader should not place
undue reliance on any forward-looking statement, which speaks only as of the date made. This
document also contains information regarding the past performance of our investments and the reader
should note that prior or current performance of investments and acquisitions is not a guarantee or
indication of future performance.</DIV>

to the financial services, real estate, resort development and vacation ownership, and restaurant
industries, while other factors apply more specifically to us. Risks and uncertainties associated
with BFC, including its wholly-owned Woodbridge subsidiary, include, but are not limited to:</DIV>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a diversified holding company whose principal holdings include a controlling
interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including BankAtlantic (&#147;BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#148;), a controlling interest in Bluegreen Corporation and its subsidiaries (&#147;Bluegreen&#148;), and
a non-controlling interest in Benihana, Inc. (&#147;Benihana&#148;). As a result of its position as the
controlling shareholder of BankAtlantic Bancorp, BFC is a &#147;unitary savings bank holding company&#148;
regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;). As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had total
consolidated assets of approximately $5.8&nbsp;billion and shareholders&#146; equity attributable to BFC of
approximately $142.9&nbsp;million.</DIV>

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, BFC&#146;s business strategy has been to invest in and acquire businesses in diverse
industries either directly or through controlled subsidiaries. However, BFC believes that, in the
short term, the Company&#146;s and its shareholders&#146; interests are best served by BFC providing
strategic support to its existing investments. In furtherance of this strategy, the Company took
several steps in 2009 and 2010, including those described below, which it believes will enhance the
Company&#146;s prospects. During the third quarter of 2009, BFC and Woodbridge Holdings Corporation
consummated their merger pursuant to which Woodbridge became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC.
During the fourth quarter of 2009, our ownership interest in Bluegreen increased to 52% as a result
of the purchase of an additional 23% interest in Bluegreen. We have also increased our investment
in BankAtlantic Bancorp through our participation in BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s rights offerings to its
shareholders during the third quarter of 2009 and the second quarter of 2010, which in the
aggregate increased our economic interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp to 45% and our voting interest in
BankAtlantic Bancorp to 71%. In the future, we will consider other opportunities that could alter
our ownership in our affiliates or seek to make opportunistic investments outside of our existing
portfolio; however, we do not currently have pre-determined parameters as to the industry or
structure of any future investment. In furtherance of our goals, we will continue to evaluate
various financing transactions that may present themselves, including raising additional debt or
equity as well as other alternative sources of new capital.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During July&nbsp;2010, Benihana announced its intention to engage in a formal review of strategic
alternatives, including a possible sale of the company. During March&nbsp;2011, Bluegreen announced its
intention to evaluate strategic alternatives for the Bluegreen Communities division, including a
possible sale of the division or disposition of its assets. Each company has engaged advisors to
assist it in pursuing strategic alternatives. BFC is supportive of Benihana and Bluegreen in
achieving their objectives.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, we consummated our merger with Woodbridge Holdings Corporation pursuant
to which Woodbridge Holdings Corporation merged with and into Woodbridge Holdings, LLC,
&#147;Woodbridge&#148; which continued as the surviving company of the merger and the successor entity to
Woodbridge Holdings Corporation. Pursuant to the terms of the merger, which was approved by each
company&#146;s shareholders at their respective meetings held on September&nbsp;21, 2009, each outstanding
share of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock automatically converted into the right to receive 3.47
shares of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. Shares otherwise issuable to us attributable to the shares of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock owned by us were canceled in connection
with the merger. As a result of the merger, Woodbridge Holdings Corporation&#146;s separate corporate
existence ceased and its Class&nbsp;A Common Stock is no longer publicly traded. See Note 3 of the
&#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for additional information about the merger.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;16, 2009, we purchased approximately 7.4&nbsp;million additional shares of Bluegreen&#146;s
common stock, which increased our ownership in Bluegreen from 9.5&nbsp;million shares, or 29%, to 16.9
million shares, or 52%, of Bluegreen&#146;s outstanding stock. As a result of the purchase, we hold a
controlling interest in Bluegreen and, since November&nbsp;16, 2009, we have consolidated Bluegreen&#146;s
results into our financial statements. Any reference to Bluegreen&#146;s results of operations for 2009
includes only 45&nbsp;days of activity for Bluegreen relating to the period from November&nbsp;16, 2009, the
date of the share purchase, through December&nbsp;31, 2009 (the &#147;Bluegreen Interim Period&#148;). Prior to
November&nbsp;16, 2009, our approximate 29% equity investment in Bluegreen was accounted for under the
equity method. See Note 4 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for additional
information about the Bluegreen share acquisition on November&nbsp;16, 2009.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to our merger with Woodbridge and our acquisition of additional shares of
Bluegreen&#146;s common stock, we also increased our investment in BankAtlantic Bancorp during 2009 and
2010 through our participation in shareholder rights offerings engaged in by BankAtlantic Bancorp
during the years. Specifically, we exercised subscription rights in BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s rights
offerings to purchase an aggregate of 14.9&nbsp;million shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock during the third quarter of 2009 and 10.0&nbsp;million shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock during June and July&nbsp;2010. In the aggregate, these purchases increased our ownership
interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp from approximately 30% to 45% and our voting interest in
BankAtlantic Bancorp from approximately 59% to 71%.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a holding company with controlling positions in BankAtlantic Bancorp and Bluegreen,
generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) requires the consolidation of the financial
results of both entities. As a consequence, the assets and liabilities of both entities are
presented on a consolidated basis in BFC&#146;s financial statements. However, except as otherwise
noted, the debts and obligations of the consolidated entities, including Woodbridge, are not direct
obligations of BFC and are non-recourse to BFC. Similarly, the assets of those entities are not
available to BFC absent a dividend or distribution. The recognition by BFC of income from
controlled entities is determined based on the total</DIV>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Real Estate and Other business activities include four business segments: BFC
Activities, Real Estate Operations, and Bluegreen&#146;s two business segments, Bluegreen Resorts and
Bluegreen Communities.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>BFC Activities</B></DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BFC Activities segment consists of BFC operations, our investment in Benihana, and
the other operations described below.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC operations primarily consist of our corporate overhead and general and administrative
expenses, including the expenses of Woodbridge, the financial results of a venture partnership that
BFC controls and other equity investments, as well as income and expenses associated with BFC&#146;s
shared service operations which provides human resources, risk management, investor relations,
executive office administration and other services to BankAtlantic Bancorp and Bluegreen. BFC
Activities also includes investments made by BFC/CCC, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary
(&#147;BFC/CCC&#148;).</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Investment in Benihana</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benihana is a NASDAQ-listed company with two classes of common shares: Common Stock (BNHN)&nbsp;and
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock (BNHNA). We own 800,000 shares of Benihana Series&nbsp;B Convertible Preferred
Stock (&#147;Convertible Preferred Stock&#148;). The Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into an
aggregate of 1,578,943 shares of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock at a conversion price of $12.67 per share
of Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment from time to time upon certain defined
events. Based on the number of currently outstanding shares of Benihana&#146;s capital stock, the
Convertible Preferred Stock, if converted, would represent an approximate 19% voting interest and
an approximate 9% economic interest in Benihana. Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock are
entitled to receive cumulative quarterly dividends at an annual rate equal to $1.25 per share,
payable on the last day of each calendar quarter. The Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to
mandatory redemption of $20&nbsp;million plus accumulated dividends on July&nbsp;2, 2014 unless we elect to
extend the mandatory redemption date to a date not later than July&nbsp;2, 2024. At December&nbsp;31, 2010,
the closing price of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock was $8.01 per share. The market value of the 800,000
shares of Convertible Preferred Stock we own if converted to Benihana&#146;s Common Stock at December
31, 2010 would have been approximately $12.6&nbsp;million.
During July 2010, Benihana announced its intention to engage in a
formal review of strategic alternative in the event that a sale
transaction is consummated, the Company would receive a minimum of
$20 million in consideration for its shares of the Convertible
Preferred Stock.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2008, the Company performed an impairment evaluation of its investment in the
Convertible Preferred Stock and determined that there was an other-than-temporary decline of
approximately $3.6&nbsp;million and, accordingly, the investment was written down to its fair value at
that time of approximately $16.4&nbsp;million. Concurrent with management&#146;s evaluation of the
impairment of this investment at December&nbsp;31, 2008, it made the determination to reclassify this
investment from investment securities to investment securities available for sale. At December&nbsp;31,
2010, the Company&#146;s estimated fair value of its investment in Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred
Stock was approximately $21.1&nbsp;million. BFC will continue to monitor this investment to determine
whether any further other-than-temporary impairment charges may be required in future periods. The
estimated fair value of the Company&#146;s investment in Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock was
assessed using the income approach with Level 3 inputs by discounting future cash flows at a market
discount rate combined with the fair value of the shares of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock that BFC would
receive upon conversion of its shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third quarter of 2009, we exercised our option to purchase 521,740 shares of Series
B Convertible Preferred Stock of Pizza Fusion at a price of $1.15 per share, or an aggregate
purchase price of $600,000, resulting in an ownership interest of approximately 45% in Pizza
Fusion. On January&nbsp;15, 2010, we purchased an additional 307,692 shares of Pizza Fusion&#146;s common
stock in Pizza Fusion&#146;s offering, in a private placement transaction, of up to $3&nbsp;million of its
common stock at a purchase price of $1.30 per share, or an aggregate purchase price of $400,000. In
connection with that purchase, we also received warrants to purchase an additional 61,538 shares of
Pizza Fusion&#146;s common stock at an exercise price of $1.56 per share. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Pizza
Fusion had 18 restaurants,</DIV>

states and Saudi Arabia and had entered into franchise agreements for an additional 7 stores. Pizza
Fusion has faced several challenges, including the effect of the current economic downturn on
consumer spending patterns and the tightening of the credit markets on the ability of new
franchisees to obtain financing. During 2009, the Company performed its annual review of goodwill
for impairment and determined that the discounted value of estimated cash flows was below the
carrying value of its investment in Pizza Fusion, resulting in a write-off of the entire $2.0
million of goodwill relating to this investment. Pizza Fusion is in its early stages and it will
require additional financial support in order to continue operations under its current business
plan. Pizza Fusion&#146;s audited financial statements for its fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2010
included a going concern opinion. We currently have no plans to make a further investment in Pizza
Fusion and Pizza Fusion has not recently been successful in its efforts to raise additional
capital.

our investment in Bluegreen under the equity method of accounting and our interest in Bluegreen&#146;s
earnings or losses was included in the BFC Activities segment. Historically, the cost of the
Bluegreen investment was adjusted to recognize our interest in Bluegreen&#146;s earnings or losses. The
difference between a) our ownership percentage in Bluegreen multiplied by its earnings and b) the
amount of our equity in earnings of Bluegreen as reflected in our financial statements related to
the amortization or accretion of purchase accounting adjustments made at the time of the initial
acquisition of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock in 2002 and a basis difference due to impairment charges
recorded on the investment, as described in Note 16 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements&#148;.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Real Estate Operations</B></DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Real Estate Operations segment is comprised of the operations of Woodbridge and the
subsidiaries through which Woodbridge historically conducted its real estate business activities.
It currently includes the operations of Carolina Oak, which engaged in homebuilding activities in
South Carolina prior to the suspension of those activities in the fourth quarter of 2008, and
Cypress Creek Holdings, LLC (&#147;Cypress Creek Holdings&#148;), which engages in leasing activities. The
Real Estate Operations segment also includes the business activities of Core, until the fourth
quarter of 2010, at which time certain subsidiaries of Core were deconsolidated from our financial
statements as discussed below.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Core Communities</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, the activities of Core Communities focused on the development of a
master-planned community in Port St. Lucie, Florida called Tradition, Florida and a community
outside of Hardeeville, South Carolina called Tradition Hilton Head. Until 2009, Tradition,
Florida was in active development as was Tradition Hilton Head, although in a much earlier stage.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2010, demand for residential and commercial inventory showed no signs of recovery,
particularly in the geographic regions where Core&#146;s properties are located. In early 2010,
Woodbridge made the decision to pursue an orderly liquidation of Core and worked cooperatively with
various lenders to achieve that objective. During November&nbsp;2010, Core entered into a settlement
agreement with one of its lenders, which had previously commenced actions seeking foreclosure of
mortgage loans totaling approximately $113.9&nbsp;million collateralized by property in Florida and
South Carolina. Under the terms of the agreement, Core pledged additional collateral to the lender
consisting of membership interests in five of Core&#146;s subsidiaries and granted security interests in
the acreage owned by such subsidiaries in Port St. Lucie, Florida, substantially all of which is
undeveloped raw land. Core also agreed to an amendment of the complaint related to the Florida
foreclosure action to include this additional collateral and an entry into consensual judgments of
foreclosure in both the Florida and South Carolina foreclosure actions. In consideration therefor,
the lender agreed not to enforce a deficiency judgment against Core and, during February&nbsp;2011,
released Core from any other claims arising from or relating to the loans. As of November&nbsp;30, 2010,
Core deconsolidated the five subsidiaries, the membership interests in which were transferred to
the lender upon entry into the consensual judgments of foreclosure. In connection therewith and in
accordance with accounting guidance for consolidation, Woodbridge recorded a guarantee obligation
&#147;deferred gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary&#148; of $11.3&nbsp;million in the Company&#146;s Consolidated
Statement of Financial Condition as of December&nbsp;31, 2010. The
deferred gain on settlement of investment in
subsidiary was recognized into income in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations at the
time Core received its general release of liability in February&nbsp;2011.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2010, Core and one of its subsidiaries entered agreements, including, without
limitation, a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure Agreement, with one of their lenders which resolved the
foreclosure proceedings commenced by the lender related to property at Tradition Hilton Head which
served as collateral for a $25&nbsp;million loan. Pursuant to the agreements, Core&#146;s subsidiary
transferred to the lender all of its right, title and interest in and to the property which served
as collateral for the loan as well as certain additional real and personal property. In
consideration therefor, the lender released Core and its subsidiary from any claims arising from or
relating to the loan. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, this transaction was
accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring and, accordingly, a $13.0&nbsp;million gain on debt
extinguishment was recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;10, 2010, Core sold its two commercial leasing projects (sometimes referred to herein
as the &#147;Projects&#148;) to Inland Real Estate Acquisition, Inc. (&#147;Inland&#148;) for approximately $75.4
million. As a result of the sale, Core realized a gain on sale of discontinued operations of
approximately $2.6&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2010. The sale resulted in net cash proceeds to
Core of approximately $1.5&nbsp;million. See Note 6 for further information regarding the Projects.</DIV>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2007, Woodbridge acquired from Levitt and Sons LLC, a former wholly-owned subsidiary of

South Carolina limited liability company (formerly known as Levitt and Sons of Jasper County, LLC).

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">during 2009, Woodbridge made the decision to cease all activities at Carolina Oak. In the
fourth quarter of 2009, the inventory of real estate at Carolina Oak was reviewed for impairment
and a $16.7&nbsp;million impairment charge was recorded to adjust the carrying amount of Carolina Oak&#146;s
inventory to its fair value of $10.8&nbsp;million. Woodbridge is the
obligor under a $37.2&nbsp;million
loan that is collateralized by the Carolina Oak property. During 2009, the lender declared the
loan to be in default and filed an action for foreclosure. While there may have been an issue with
respect to compliance with certain covenants in the loan documents, we do not believe that an event
of default occurred. Through participation in a court-ordered mediation of this matter, the parties
agreed to tentative terms to settle the matter and are currently negotiating a formal settlement
agreement. It is currently expected that this settlement agreement, if finalized, will provide for
(i)&nbsp;Woodbridge to pay $2.5&nbsp;million to the investor group, (ii)&nbsp;Carolina Oak to convey to the
investor group the real property securing the loan via a stipulated foreclosure or deed in lieu,
(iii)&nbsp;the investor group to release Woodbridge and Carolina Oak from their obligations relating to
the debt or, alternatively, to agree not to pursue certain remedies, including a deficiency
judgment, that would otherwise be available to them, in each case subject to certain conditions,
and (iv)&nbsp;the litigation to be dismissed. There is no assurance that the settlement will be
finalized on the contemplated terms, or at all.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Cypress Creek Holdings</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2005, Cypress Creek Holdings has owned an 80,000 square foot office building in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida. The building was previously 50% occupied by an unaffiliated third party
pursuant to a lease which expired in March&nbsp;2010. The tenant opted not to renew the lease and
vacated the space as of March&nbsp;31, 2010. All efforts to lease the space to date have been
unsuccessful. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, we evaluated the value of the office building for
impairment in accordance with the accounting guidance for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
assets and determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value. Accordingly, during 2010 and
2009, the Company recognized impairment charges related to the office building of $3.9&nbsp;million and
$4.3&nbsp;million, respectively. During the first quarter of 2011, Cypress Creek Holdings&#146; lender with
respect to the office building agreed to permit Cypress Creek Holdings to pursue a short sale of
the building. Whether a lease or sale will ultimately be consummated and Cypress Creek Holdings&#146;
obligations to the lender in the event of a short sale are uncertain at this time.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Levitt and Sons</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquired in December&nbsp;1999, Levitt and Sons was a developer of single family homes and town
home communities for active adults and families in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.
Increased inventory levels combined with weakened consumer demand for housing and tightened credit
requirements negatively affected sales, deliveries and margins throughout the homebuilding
industry. Levitt and Sons experienced decreased orders, decreased margins and increased
cancellation rates on homes in backlog. Excess supply, particularly in Florida, in combination
with a reduction in demand resulting from tightened credit requirements and reductions in credit
availability, as well as buyers&#146; fears about the direction of the market, exerted continuous
downward pricing pressure for residential homes.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;9, 2007 (the &#147;Petition Date&#148;), Levitt and Sons and substantially all of its
subsidiaries (collectively, the &#147;Debtors&#148;) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter&nbsp;11 of
Title 11 of the United States Code (the &#147;Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases&#148;) in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the Southern District of Florida (the &#147;Bankruptcy Court&#148;).</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the filing of the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases, we deconsolidated Levitt and Sons as of
November&nbsp;9, 2007, eliminating all future operations from our financial results of operations. As a
result of the deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons, we recorded our interest in Levitt and Sons under
the cost method of accounting. During June&nbsp;2008, Woodbridge entered into a settlement agreement
(the &#147;Settlement Agreement&#148;) with the Debtors and the Joint Committee of Unsecured Creditors
appointed in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases (the &#147;Joint Committee&#148;). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, as
it was subsequently amended, Woodbridge agreed to (i)&nbsp;pay $8&nbsp;million to the Debtors&#146; bankruptcy
estates (sometimes referred to herein as the &#147;Debtors&#146; Estate&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;place $4.5&nbsp;million in a
release fund to be disbursed to third party creditors in exchange for a third party release and
injunction, (iii)&nbsp;make a $300,000 payment to a deposit holders fund and (iv)&nbsp;share a percentage of
any tax refund attributable to periods prior to the bankruptcy with the Debtors&#146; Estate. In
addition, Woodbridge agreed to waive and release substantially all of the claims it had against the
Debtors, including administrative expense claims through July&nbsp;2008, and the Debtors (joined by the
Joint Committee) agreed to waive and release any claims they had against Woodbridge and its
affiliates. On February&nbsp;20, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming a plan of
liquidation jointly proposed by Levitt and Sons and the Joint Committee. That order also approved
the settlement pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, as amended. No appeal or rehearing of the
court&#146;s order was filed by any party, and the settlement was consummated on March&nbsp;3, 2009,</DIV>

$52.9&nbsp;million liability (less $500,000 which was determined as the settlement holdback and remained
as an accrual pursuant to the Settlement Agreement), was recognized into income in the first
quarter of 2009, resulting in a $40.4&nbsp;million gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary. In
the fourth quarter of 2009, we accrued approximately $10.7&nbsp;million in connection with a portion of
a tax refund of which the Debtors&#146; Estate is entitled to pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. As a
result, the gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 was

developed or acquired by Bluegreen or developed by others. Bluegreen Resorts also provides
fee-based services to third party resort developers and timeshare property owners&#146; associations.
These services include selling and marketing third-party developers&#146; VOIs, mortgage servicing,
construction management, title, and resort management. Bluegreen Communities acquires, develops and
subdivides property and markets residential land home sites. The majority of these home sites are
sold directly to retail customers who seek to build a home, in some cases on properties featuring a
golf course and related amenities. On March&nbsp;24, 2011, Bluegreen announced that Bluegreen had
engaged advisors to explore strategic alternatives for Bluegreen Communities, including a possible
sale of the division. There can be no assurance, however, regarding the timing or whether Bluegreen
will elect to pursue any of the strategic alternatives Bluegreen may consider, or that any such
alternatives, if pursued and ultimately consummated, will result in improvements to Bluegreen&#146;s
financial condition and operating results or otherwise achieve the benefits Bluegreen expects to
realize from the transaction.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its inception in 1994, Bluegreen Resorts has been involved in the vacation ownership
industry. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen were selling VOIs in the Bluegreen Vacation Club at
20 sales offices at resorts located in the United States and Aruba. Bluegreen believes the
Bluegreen Vacation Club allows its VOI owners to customize their vacation experience in a more
flexible manner than traditional fixed-week vacation ownership programs. A deeded real estate
interest in a Bluegreen Vacation Club VOI in any of Bluegreen resorts entitles the buyer to an
annual or biennial allotment of &#147;points&#148; in perpetuity. Club members may use their points to stay
in one of 27 Bluegreen Vacation Club &#151; Club Resorts and 29 other Club Associated Resorts as well
as having access to other vacation options, including cruises and stays at over 4,000 resorts
offered through Resort Condominiums International, LLC (&#147;RCI&#148;), an unaffiliated external exchange
network. Club members who acquired or upgraded their VOIs on or after November&nbsp;1, 2007 also have
access to 21 Shell Vacation Club (&#147;Shell&#148;) resorts, through Bluegreen&#146;s Select Connections&#153; joint
venture with Shell. Shell is an unaffiliated privately-held resort developer.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2010, Bluegreen continued to expand its fee-based service business. Bluegreen believes
that it can leverage its expertise in sales and marketing, mortgage servicing, fee-based management
services, title and construction management by offering these fee-based services to third party
timeshare developers and property owners&#146; associations. Bluegreen fee-based services business
generates positive cash flows and typically requires less capital investment than its traditional
vacation ownership business.</DIV>

<DIV align="right" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Real Estate</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Bluegreen&#146;s inception, it has generated approximately 353,000 VOI sales transactions,
which include over 9,000 VOI sales transactions on behalf of third party developers. Bluegreen
Resorts&#146; estimated remaining life-of-project sales of Bluegreen-owned inventory at December&nbsp;31,
2010, were approximately $2.9&nbsp;billion, (this includes approximately $1.0&nbsp;billion of which relates
to fully developed inventory). For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen Resorts recognized
system-wide sales segment operating profit of $290.3&nbsp;million and $63.7&nbsp;million, respectively. The
2010 segment operating profit reflects a non-cash charge of $21.2&nbsp;million to increase the allowance
for loan losses on our VOI notes receivable generated prior to November&nbsp;1, 2008 (the date we
implemented Fair Isaac Corporation (&#147;FICO&#174;&#148;)-based credit underwriting standards).</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen also offers a Sampler program that allows purchasers of this product to enjoy
substantially the same amenities, activities and services offered to Bluegreen Vacation Club
members during a trial period which is generally one or two years. Bluegreen believes that it
benefits from the sampler program as it gives them an opportunity to market their VOIs to customers
when they use their trial memberships at Bluegreen resorts and to recapture a portion of the costs
incurred in connection with the initial marketing to prospective customers.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the sampler program described above, Bluegreen Resorts uses a variety of
methods to attract prospective purchasers of VOIs including marketing of mini-vacations either
through face-to-face contact at retail and leisure locations or through telemarketing campaigns and
marketing to current owners of VOIs.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purchasers of VOIs are required to make a down payment of at least 10% of the VOI sales price
and, subject to meeting eligibility requirements, may finance the balance of the sales price over a
period of up to ten years. As part of Bluegreen&#146;s continued efforts to improve its cash flows from
operations, beginning in 2009, Bluegreen began incentivizing its sales associates to encourage
higher cash down payments, and as a result, Bluegreen has increased both the percentage of its
sales that are 100% cash and its average down payment on financed sales. Including down payments
received on financed sales, 54% of Bluegreen&#146;s 2010 sales were paid in cash within approximately 30
days from the contract date. Due to a significant reduction of liquidity in the receivable-backed
credit markets commencing in the fourth quarter of 2008, and due to Bluegreen&#146;s continued desire to
manage efficiencies in its timeshare marketing costs, Bluegreen purposely and significantly reduced
its sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2008. Since that time, Bluegreen has and intends to
continue to adjust its sales volumes based on available liquidity in the receivable credit markets,
the success of Bluegreen&#146;s efforts to increase the amount of cash paid at or shortly after the time
that sales contracts are entered into and its ability to achieve desired levels of marketing
efficiencies.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen&#146;s VOI receivables portfolio totaled approximately $705.4
million in principal amount.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain liquidity associated with Bluegreen&#146;s VOI receivables, Bluegreen has historically
had credit facilities pursuant to which it pledged or sold its consumer notes receivable. From
time to time, Bluegreen also engages in private placement securitization transactions and similar
arrangements to pay down all or a portion of its note receivable credit facilities. During 2010,
Bluegreen successfully entered into new credit facilities, renewed or extended certain of its
existing credit facilities, and completed two term securitization transactions. The challenging
credit markets have negatively impacted Bluegreen&#146;s financing activities in recent years compared
to historical levels. While the credit markets appear to be recovering and Bluegreen entered into
term securitizations and new financing facilities during 2010 as described further in Bluegreen&#146;s
<I>Liquidity and Capital Resources </I>above, the number of banks and other finance companies in the
market to provide &#147;warehouse&#148; lines of credit for timeshare receivables have decreased in recent
years as several firms have left the space. Bluegreen continues to actively pursue additional
credit facility capacity, capital markets transactions and alternative financing solutions, and
hopes that its business model and financial profile will position Bluegreen to maintain its
existing credit relationships as well as attract new sources of capital.</DIV>

land home sites. The majority of homesites are sold directly to retail customers who seek to build
a home generally in the future (in some cases on properties featuring a golf course and other
related amenities). Bluegreen Communities has historically sought to acquire and develop
land near major metropolitan centers, but outside the perimeter of intense subdivision development,
and in popular retirement areas.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Bluegreen Communities&#146; business has been, and continues to be, adversely impacted by the

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;23, 2011, the Parent Company and BankAtlantic each entered into a Stipulation and
Consent to Issuance of Order to Cease and Desist with the Office of Thrift Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;), the
Parent Company&#146;s and BankAtlantic&#146;s primary regulator. The Order to Cease and Desist to which the
Parent Company is subject is referred to as the &#147;Company Order,&#148; the Order to Cease and Desist to
which BankAtlantic is subject is referred to as the &#147;Bank Order&#148; and the Company Order and Bank
Order are referred to collectively as the &#147;Orders.&#148; The OTS issued the Orders due primarily to the
Company&#146;s losses over the past three years, high levels of classified assets and inadequate levels
of capital based on BankAtlantic&#146;s risk profile as determined by the OTS&#146;s recent examination.
Under the terms of the Company Order, the Parent Company is required to submit written plans to the
OTS on or prior to March&nbsp;31, 2011 that will address, among other things, how the Parent Company
intends to maintain and enhance its and BankAtlantic&#146;s capital and set forth the Parent Company&#146;s
business plan for the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2011. In addition, the Parent Company is prohibited
from taking certain actions without receiving the prior written non-objection of the OTS,
including, without limitation, declaring or paying any dividends or other capital distributions and
incurring certain indebtedness. The Parent Company is also required to ensure BankAtlantic&#146;s
compliance with the terms of the Bank Order as well as all applicable laws, rules, regulations and
agency guidance.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic is required to attain by June&nbsp;30, 2011 and maintain a tier 1 (core)&nbsp;capital ratio
equal to or greater than 8% and a total risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 14%. At
December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic had a tier 1 (core)&nbsp;capital ratio of 6.22% and a total risk-based
capital ratio of 11.72%. The Parent Company and BankAtlantic will seek to meet the higher capital
requirements through the expected net gain upon consummation of its Tampa branch sale anticipated
to close June&nbsp;2011 (subject to regulatory approvals and customary conditions) and through other
efforts that may include the issuance of its Class&nbsp;A Common Stock through a public or private
offering. Based on asset reductions associated with the Tampa branch sale and deposit levels as of
December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic estimates that the Tampa transaction will add over 130 basis points
(1.30%) to its regulatory capital ratios. While BankAtlantic is taking steps to achieve the
capital ratios set forth in the Bank Order by June&nbsp;30, 2011, such ratios may not be attained by
that date or at all.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic is also required to, among other things, revise certain of its plans, programs
and policies and submit to the OTS certain written plans, including a capital plan, a contingency
plan (only in the event it fails to timely attain and maintain the increased capital ratio
requirements), a revised business plan and a plan to reduce BankAtlantic&#146;s delinquent loans and
non-performing and other &#147;problem&#148; assets. In addition, the Bank Order requires BankAtlantic to
limit its asset growth and restricts BankAtlantic from originating or purchasing new commercial
real estate loans or entering into certain material agreements, in each case without receiving the
prior written non-objection of the OTS. Separately, the OTS has confirmed that it has no objection
to the origination of new loans to facilitate the sale of certain assets, the renewal, extension,
modification of existing commercial real estate loans or the funding on existing commitments of
commercial real estate loans, subject in each case to compliance with applicable regulations and
BankAtlantic&#146;s policies. The Bank Order also imposes restrictions on BankAtlantic&#146;s ability to pay
dividends and other distributions.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orders also include certain restrictions on compensation paid to the senior executive
officers of the Company and BankAtlantic, and restrictions on agreements with affiliates. The
Orders became effective on February&nbsp;23, 2011 and will remain in effect until terminated, modified
or suspended by the OTS.</DIV>

metropolitan areas surrounding the cities of Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, West Palm Beach and Tampa,

Hillsborough and Pinellas. In January&nbsp;2011, BankAtlantic entered into a purchase and assumption
agreement with PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (&#147;PNC&#148;) to sell its Tampa branches and related
facilities in order to concentrate its efforts on its core markets in southeast Florida. The

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic began its &#147;Florida&#146;s Most Convenient Bank&#148; strategy in 2002, when it introduced
seven-day banking in Florida. This banking initiative contributed to a significant increase in
core deposits (demand deposit accounts, NOW checking accounts and savings accounts). BankAtlantic&#146;s
core deposits increased from approximately $600&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2001 to $2.8&nbsp;billion as
of December&nbsp;31, 2010. Additionally, while the increase in core deposits during 2009 and 2010 may
reflect, in part, favorable market conditions generally, we believe that the implementation of new
strategies in 2008 further extend our visibility in the market and increased customer loyalty
contributed significantly to the increase in core deposit balances.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past three years, management has implemented initiatives with a view to managing
capital in the current adverse economic environment. These initiatives primarily included reducing
risk-based asset levels through loan and securities repayments in the ordinary course, reducing
total assets, eliminating cash dividends to the Parent Company and reducing expenses. These
initiatives, while important to maintaining capital ratios, have also had the effect of negatively
impacting results from operations as the reduction in asset levels resulted in a reduction of
earning assets adversely impacting our net interest income. BankAtlantic&#146;s regulatory capital
ratios have also been enhanced through capital contributions from the Parent Company. During the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Parent Company contributed capital of $28
million, $105&nbsp;million and $65&nbsp;million, respectively, to BankAtlantic. As a result of the
contributions and BankAtlantic&#146;s core operations, BankAtlantic was able to maintain the following
capital ratios over the past three years:</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic continued initiatives to decrease operating expenses during 2010. These
initiatives included, among others, lowering advertising and marketing expenditures, reducing store
and call center hours, consolidating back-office operations and staffing levels, and renegotiating
vendor contracts. During 2011, management intends to seek additional efficiencies through the
sale of its Tampa branches. BankAtlantic is also continuing to evaluate its products and services
as well as its delivery systems and back-office support infrastructure with a view toward enhancing
its operational efficiency.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of BankAtlantic&#146;s efforts to diversify its loan portfolio and reduce its concentration
on commercial real estate and construction loans, BankAtlantic&#146;s loan originations during 2010 were
focused on small business and commercial non-mortgage loans originated through its retail and
lending networks. BankAtlantic anticipates that it will continue to emphasize small business and
commercial non-real estate lending and that the percentage represented by its commercial real
estate and residential mortgage loan portfolio balances will decline during 2011, through the
scheduled repayment of existing loans and the fact that BankAtlantic is generally not originating
new commercial real estate loans.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><B><I>Loan products</I></B></U></DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic offers a number of lending products. Historically, primary lending products have
included residential loans, commercial real estate loans, consumer loans, and small business and
commercial non-mortgage loans.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Residential: </I></B>BankAtlantic purchases residential loans in the secondary markets that have been
originated by other institutions. These loans, which are serviced by independent servicers, are
secured by properties located throughout the United States. Residential loans are typically
purchased in bulk and are generally non-conforming loans under agency guidelines due primarily to
the size of the individual loans (&#147;jumbo loans&#148;). Some of the purchased residential loans are
interest-only loans. These loans result in possible future increases in a borrower&#146;s loan payments
when the contractually required repayments increase due to interest rate adjustments or when
required amortization of the principal amount commences. These payment increases could affect a
borrower&#146;s ability to repay the loan and result in increased defaults and losses. At December&nbsp;31,
2010, BankAtlantic&#146;s residential loan portfolio included $550.2&nbsp;million of interest-only loans,
$52.1&nbsp;million of which will become fully amortizing and have interest rates reset in 2011. The
credit scores and loan-to-value ratios for interest-only loans are similar to those of amortizing
loans. BankAtlantic sought to manage the credit risk associated with these loans by limiting
purchases of interest-only loans to those originated to borrowers that it believed to be credit
worthy and with loan-to-value and total debt to income ratios within agency guidelines.
BankAtlantic did not purchase or originate sub-prime, option-arm, &#147;pick-a-payment&#148; or negative
amortizing residential loans. Loans in the purchased residential loan portfolio generally do not
have prepayment penalties. As part of its initiative to reduce assets with a view toward improving
liquidity and regulatory capital ratios, BankAtlantic purchased $9.9&nbsp;million and $6.5&nbsp;million of
these loans during 2010 and 2009, respectively.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic originates residential loans to customers that are then sold on a servicing
released basis to a correspondent. It also originates and holds certain residential loans, which
are made primarily to &#147;low to moderate income&#148; borrowers in accordance with requirements of the
Community Reinvestment Act. The underwriting of these loans generally follows government agency
guidelines and independent appraisers typically perform on-site inspections and valuations of the
collateral.</DIV>

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">estate loans were generally
originated in amounts based upon the appraised value of the collateral or estimated cost to
construct, generally had a loan-to value ratio at the time of origination of less than 80%, and
generally required that one or more of the principals of the borrowing entity guaranteed these
loans. Most of these loans have variable interest
rates and are indexed to either prime or LIBOR rates. Due to high concentrations of
commercial real estate and construction loans in BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolio, BankAtlantic
ceased the origination of commercial real estate loans during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010.
Additionally, pursuant to the Bank Order, BankAtlantic has agreed to cease the purchase or
origination of new commercial real estate loans unless it receives the prior written non-objection
of the OTS Regional Director. However, BankAtlantic may originate new loans to facilitate the sale
of nonperforming assets or criticized assets, fund commercial real estate loan commitments entered
into before November&nbsp;1, 2010, make protective advances for taxes and insurance and renew, extend
or modify existing commercial real estate loans, provided that such funding complies with
regulatory underwriting guidelines and BankAtlantic&#146;s lending policies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s commercial real estate loan portfolio is divided into four loan classes;
commercial residential, commercial owner occupied, commercial land, and commercial other.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Commercial residential real estate loans </I>have resulted in significant losses to BankAtlantic.
This class of loans is divided into three categories &#151; builder land bank loans, land acquisition
and development loans, and land acquisition, development and construction loans. The builder land
bank loan category consists of land loans to borrowers who have or had land purchase option
agreements with regional and/or national builders. These loans were originally underwritten based
on projected sales of the developed lots to the builders/option holders, and timely repayment of
the loans is primarily dependent upon the sale of the property pursuant to the options. If the
lots are not sold as originally anticipated, the borrowers may not be in a position to service the
loans, with the likely result being an increase in loan losses in this category. The land
acquisition and development loan category consists of loans secured by residential land which was
intended to be developed by the borrower and sold to homebuilders. We believe that the
underwriting on these loans was generally more stringent than builder land bank loans, as an
option agreement with a regional or national builder did not exist at the origination date. The
land acquisition, development and construction loans are secured by residential land which was
intended to be fully developed by the borrower who also might have plans to construct homes on the
property. These loans generally involved property with a longer investment and development
horizon, and were guaranteed by the borrower or individuals so it was expected that the borrower
would have the ability to service the debt for a longer period of time. However, based on the
declines in value in the Florida real estate market, all loans collateralized by Florida real
estate expose the Bank to significant risk.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Commercial real estate owner occupied loans </I>are also real estate collateralized loans;
however, the primary source of repayment is the cash flow from the business operated on the
premises of the collateralized property.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Commercial real estate land loans </I>include loans secured by the sale of land and commercial
land held for investment purposes. These loans are generally to borrowers that intend to expand
the zoning of the property and ultimately sell the property to developers. These loans are
considered higher risk than owner occupied or loans with income producing collateral as the
repayment of the loan is dependent on the sale of the collateral or the financial strength of the
borrower or guarantors.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Commercial other real estate loans </I>are primarily secured by income producing property which
includes shopping centers, office buildings, self storage facilities, and warehouses.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic has sold participations in certain commercial real estate loans that it
originated. BankAtlantic administers the loans and provides participants periodic reports on the
progress of the project for which the loan was made. Major decisions regarding the loans are made
by the participants on either a majority or unanimous basis. As a result, BankAtlantic generally
cannot significantly modify the loans without either majority or unanimous consent of the
participants. BankAtlantic&#146;s sale of loan participations has the effect of reducing its exposure
on individual projects, and was required in some cases in order to comply with the regulatory
&#147;loans to one borrower&#148; limitations. BankAtlantic has also purchased commercial real estate loan
participations from other financial institutions, and in such cases BankAtlantic may not be in a
position to control decisions made with respect to the loans.</DIV>

commitments issued by BankAtlantic to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is the same as extending loans to customers.
BankAtlantic may hold certificates of deposit, liens on corporate assets and liens on residential
and commercial property as collateral for letters of credit. BankAtlantic issues commitments for
commercial real estate and commercial non-mortgage loans.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Commercial non-mortgage loans: </I></B>These loans are generally business loans secured by the
receivables, inventory, equipment, and/or general corporate assets of the borrowers. These loans
generally have variable interest rates that are Prime or LIBOR based and are typically originated
for terms ranging from one to five years.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Consumer</I></B><I>: </I>Consumer loans primarily consist of loans to individuals originated through
BankAtlantic&#146;s retail network. Approximately 97% of consumer loans are home equity lines of
credit secured by a first or second mortgage on the primary residence of the borrower,
substantially all of which is located in Florida. Approximately 26% of home equity lines of credit
balances are secured by a first mortgage on the property. Home equity lines of credit have
prime-based interest rates and generally mature in 15&nbsp;years. Other consumer loans generally have
fixed interest rates with terms ranging from one to five years. The credit quality of consumer
loans is adversely impacted by increases in the unemployment rate and declining real estate
values. During the past three years, BankAtlantic experienced higher than historical losses in
this portfolio as a result of deteriorating economic conditions in Florida. In an attempt to
address this issue, BankAtlantic has adopted more stringent underwriting criteria for consumer
loans which has had the effect of significantly reducing consumer loan originations.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Small Business: </I></B>BankAtlantic originates small business loans to companies located primarily
in markets within BankAtlantic&#146;s branch network. Small business loans are primarily originated on
a secured basis and do not generally exceed $2.0&nbsp;million. These loans are generally originated
with maturities ranging from one to three years or are due upon demand. Lines of credit extended
to small businesses are due upon demand. Small business loans have either fixed or variable
prime-based interest rates.</DIV>

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Securities available for sale: </I>BankAtlantic invests in obligations of, or securities
guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies. These include mortgage-backed securities and
real estate mortgage investment conduits (&#147;REMICs&#148;). BankAtlantic&#146;s securities available for sale
portfolio at December&nbsp;31, 2010 reflects a decision to seek high credit quality and securities
guaranteed by government sponsored enterprises in an attempt to minimize credit risk in its
investment portfolio to the extent possible. During 2010, BankAtlantic began investing in
municipal and agency securities that mature in less than two years. These short-term investments
carried higher yields than alternative short-term investments. The available for sale securities
portfolio serves as a source of liquidity as well as a means to moderate the effects of interest
rate changes. The decision to purchase and sell securities from time to time is based upon a
current assessment of the economy, the interest rate environment, and capital and liquidity
strategies and requirements. BankAtlantic&#146;s investment portfolio does not include credit default
swaps, commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, structured investment vehicles, auction
rate securities, trust preferred securities or equity securities in Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Tax Certificates: </I>Tax certificates are evidences of tax obligations that are sold through
auctions or bulk sales by various state and local taxing authorities. A tax obligation arises
when the property owner fails to timely pay the real estate taxes on the property. Certain
municipalities bulk sale their entire tax certificates for the prior year by auctioning the
portfolio to the highest bidder instead of auctioning each certificate separately. Tax
certificates represent a priority lien against the real property for the delinquent real estate
taxes. The minimum repayment to satisfy the lien is the certificate amount plus the interest
accrued through the redemption date, plus applicable penalties, fees and costs. Tax certificates
have no payment schedule or stated maturity. If the certificate holder does not file for the deed
within established time frames, the certificate may become null and void and lose its value.
BankAtlantic&#146;s experience with this type of investment has generally been favorable because the
rates earned are generally higher than many alternative investments and substantial repayments
typically occur over a one-year period. During 2008, BankAtlantic discontinued acquiring tax
certificates through bulk acquisitions as it experienced higher than historical losses from these
types of acquisitions. During 2009 and 2010, BankAtlantic purchased tax certificates primarily in
Florida and expects that the majority of tax certificates it acquires in 2011 will be in Florida.

solicited deposits from customers in its geographic market through marketing and relationship
banking activities primarily conducted through its sales force and store network. BankAtlantic
primarily solicited deposits at its branches (or stores) through its &#147;Florida&#146;s Most Convenient

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act permanently raised the maximum standard deposit
insurance to $250,000 per depositor and the Act provides full deposit insurance coverage on

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parent Company&#146;s operations primarily consist of financing the capital needs of
BankAtlantic and its subsidiaries and management of the asset work-out subsidiary. In March&nbsp;2008,
the Parent Company used a portion of the proceeds obtained from the sale of Ryan Beck to Stifel to
purchase from BankAtlantic $101.5&nbsp;million of non-performing loans at BankAtlantic&#146;s carrying value.
These loans are held in an asset workout subsidiary wholly-owned by the Parent Company, which has
entered into an agreement with BankAtlantic pursuant to which BankAtlantic services the transferred
non-performing loans. The Parent also has arrangements with BFC Financial Corporation (&#147;BFC&#148;) for
BFC to provide certain human resources, insurance management, investor relations, real estate
advisory services and other administrative services to the Parent and its subsidiaries. The largest
expense of the Parent Company is interest expense on junior subordinated debentures issued in
connection with trust preferred securities. The Company has the right to defer quarterly payments
of interest on the junior subordinated debentures for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive
quarters without default or penalty. During all four quarters of 2009 and 2010 and during the first
quarter of 2011, the Company notified the trustees under its junior subordinated debentures that it
has elected to defer its quarterly interest payments. During the deferral period, the respective
trusts suspend the declaration and payment of dividends on the trust preferred securities.
Additionally, during the deferral period, the Company may not pay dividends on or repurchase its
common stock. The Parent Company deferred the interest and dividend payments in order to preserve
its liquidity in response to current economic conditions.

Woodbridge and its subsidiaries, 8 employees supporting BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company, 1,202
employees supporting BankAtlantic (including 162 part time employees) and 3825 employees supporting
Bluegreen, of which 355 were located in Bluegreen&#146;s headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida and 3,470
were located in regional field offices throughout the United States and Aruba. The field personnel
at Bluegreen include 85 field employees supporting Bluegreen Communities and 3,385 field employees

many of which have greater liquidity and financial resources than Bluegreen. Many of the world&#146;s
most recognized lodging, hospitality and entertainment companies develop and sell VOIs in resort
properties. Major companies that now operate or are developing or planning to develop vacation
ownership resorts directly or through subsidiaries include Marriott International, Inc., the Walt
Disney Company, Hilton Hotels Corporation, Hyatt Corporation, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts,
Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Inc. and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation. Bluegreen Resorts
also competes with numerous other smaller owners and operators of vacation ownership resorts. In
addition to competing for sales leads, prospects and fee-based service clients, Bluegreen Resorts
competes with other VOI developers for marketing, sales, and resort management personnel.
Bluegreen Communities competes with builders, developers and others for the acquisition of property
and with local, regional and national developers, homebuilders and others with respect to the sale
of homesites. Bluegreen will compete with others on the basis of its reputation and the price,
location and quality of the product it offers for sale.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banking and financial services industry is very competitive and is in a transition period.
The financial services industry continues to experience a severe downturn and increased
competition in the marketplace. We expect continued consolidation in the financial services
industry creating larger financial institutions. Our primary method of competition is emphasis on
relationship banking, customer service and convenience.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic faces substantial competition for both loans and deposits. Competition for loans
comes principally from other banks, savings institutions and other lenders. This competition could
decrease the number and size of loans that BankAtlantic makes and the interest rates and fees that
it receives on these loans.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic competes for deposits with banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well
as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds and mutual
funds, many of which are uninsured. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than
BankAtlantic, which could decrease the deposits that BankAtlantic attracts or require BankAtlantic
to increase its rates to attract new deposits. Increased competition for deposits could increase
BankAtlantic&#146;s cost of funds, reduce its net interest margin and adversely affect its results of
operations.

Common Stock and all of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, which in the aggregate
represents an approximately 45% equity interest and 71% voting interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp.
BankAtlantic Bancorp is the holding company of BankAtlantic by virtue of its ownership of 100% of
BankAtlantic&#146;s outstanding common stock. Accordingly, each of BFC and BankAtlantic Bancorp is a
unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the
OTS, including normal supervision and reporting requirements. Therefore,
the regulations discussed below relating to BankAtlantic Bancorp are also applicable to BFC.
Additionally, the Company, BankAtlantic Bancorp and Bluegreen are each subject to the reporting and other
requirements of the Exchange Act.

meaning of the Home Owners&#146; Loan Act (&#147;HOLA&#148;), as amended, or HOLA. As such, we are each registered
with the Office of Thrift Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;), and are each subject to OTS regulations,
examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the OTS has enforcement
authority over each of us. Among other things, this authority permits the OTS to restrict or
prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or
stability of a subsidiary savings association. Recent changes in the law will, during 2011, shift
principal regulatory jurisdiction over BankAtlantic Bancorp and BFC to the Federal Reserve.
Management is in the process of evaluating the potential practical implications of this shift in
regulatory jurisdiction, such as possible changes in how regulators will examine BankAtlantic
Bancorp and BFC and what new or different standards they may apply. As a result of this shift,
management expects that BFC and BankAtlantic Bancorp, at its parent company level, will at some
point be subject to minimum capital ratios for the first time. To date, regulators have not
announced specifics about the change in regulatory jurisdiction in enough detail that would allow
management to understand what the consequences of the shift will be.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In evaluating an application by a holding company to acquire a savings institution, the OTS
must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and
savings institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds, the
convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a unitary savings and loan holding company, neither BFC nor BankAtlantic Bancorp is
generally restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which it may
engage, provided that BankAtlantic continues to satisfy the Qualified Thrift Lender, or QTL, test.
See &#147;Regulation of Federal Savings Associations &#151; BankAtlantic &#151; QTL Test&#148; for a discussion of
the QTL requirements. If either BFC or BankAtlantic Bancorp was to make a non-supervisory
acquisition of another savings institution or of a savings institution that meets the QTL test and
is deemed to be a savings institution by the OTS and that will be held as a separate subsidiary,
then BFC or BankAtlantic Bancorp, as the case may be, would become a multiple savings and loan
holding company within the meaning of HOLA and would be subject to limitations on the types of
business activities in which it can engage. HOLA limits the activities of a multiple savings
institution holding company and its non-insured institution subsidiaries primarily to activities
permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject
to the prior approval of the OTS, and to other activities authorized by OTS regulation.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act is expected to
have a broad impact on the financial services industry, imposing significant regulatory and
compliance changes, including the designation of certain financial companies as systemically
significant, the imposition of increased capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements, and
numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthen the
safety and soundness within, the financial services sector. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act
establishes a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the financial
system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies, including the
Financial Stability Oversight Council, or Council, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (the &#147;OCC&#148;), and the FDIC. Of particular relevance to BFC and
BankAtlantic Bancorp, the Dodd-Frank Act makes fundamental changes to the federal supervisory
oversight structure for federal thrifts and savings and loan holding companies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.

    <TD><I>Principal changes for federal thrifts and savings and loan holding companies. </I>The
Dodd-Frank Act preserves the charter for federal thrifts, but will eliminate the OTS as the
primary federal regulator for federal thrifts and savings and loan holding companies. The
OTS will be abolished by April&nbsp;2012 and its functions and personnel distributed among the
OCC, FDIC, and the Federal Reserve. Primary jurisdiction for the supervision and regulation
of federal thrifts, including BankAtlantic, will be transferred to the OCC; supervision and
regulation of savings and loan holding companies, including BFC and BankAtlantic Bancorp,
will be transferred to the Federal Reserve. Although the Dodd-Frank Act maintains the
federal thrift charter, it eliminates certain benefits of the charter and imposes new
penalties for failure to comply with the QTL test. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, risk-based and
leverage capital standards currently applicable to U.S. insured depository institutions
will be imposed on U.S. bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies, and
depository institutions and their holding companies will be subject to minimum risk-based
and leverage capital requirements on a consolidated basis. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act
requires that savings and loan holding companies be well-capitalized and well managed in
the same manner as bank holding companies in order to engage in the expanded financial
activities permissible only for a financial holding company.</TD>

    <TD><I>Source of strength. </I>The Dodd-Frank Act requires all companies, including savings and
loan holding companies, that directly or indirectly control an insured depository
institution to serve as a source of strength for the institution. Under this requirement,
regulations may seek to require BFC and/or BankAtlantic Bancorp to provide financial
assistance to BankAtlantic.</TD>

    <TD><I>Limitation on federal preemption</I>. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly reduces the ability
of national banks and federal thrifts to rely upon federal preemption of state consumer
financial laws. Although the OCC, as the new primary regulator of federal thrifts, will
have the ability to make preemption determinations where certain conditions are met, the
broad rollback of federal preemption has the potential to create a patchwork of federal and
state compliance obligations. This could, in turn, result in significant new regulatory
requirements applicable to BFC, BankAtlantic Bancorp and BankAtlantic, potentially
significant changes in our operations and increases in our compliance costs. It could also
result in uncertainty concerning compliance, with attendant regulatory and litigation
risks.</TD>

regulatory requirements that may affect our operations and result in increased compliance
costs. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes new standards for mortgage loan originations
on all lenders, including banks and thrifts, in
an effort to require steps to verify a borrower&#146;s ability to repay. In addition, the
Dodd-Frank Act generally requires lenders or securitizers to retain an economic interest in
the credit risk relating to loans the lender sells or mortgage and other asset-backed
securities that the securitizer issues. The risk retention requirement generally will be 5%,
but could be increased or decreased by regulation.</TD>

Act requires that certain swaps and derivatives activities be &#147;pushed out&#148; of insured
depository institutions and conducted in non-bank affiliates, significantly restricts the
ability of a member of a depository institution holding company group to invest in or
sponsor certain private funds, and broadly restricts such entities from engaging in

subject to the FDIC&#146;s resolution process, the Dodd-Frank Act creates a new mechanism for
the FDIC to conduct the orderly liquidation of certain &#147;covered financial companies,&#148;
including bank and thrift holding companies and systemically significant non-bank financial
companies. Upon certain findings being made, the FDIC may be appointed receiver for a
covered financial company, and would be tasked with conducting an orderly liquidation of
the entity. The FDIC liquidation process is modeled on the existing Federal Deposit
Insurance Act, or FDI Act, bank resolution regulations, and generally gives the FDIC more
discretion than in the traditional bankruptcy context.</TD>

    <TD><I>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)</I>. The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new
independent CFPB within the Federal Reserve. The CFPB is tasked with establishing and
implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with
respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services.
The CFPB has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services
offered to bank and thrift consumers. For banking organizations with assets of $10&nbsp;billion
or more, the CFPB has exclusive rule making and examination, and primary enforcement
authority under federal consumer financial law. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits
states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those
regulations promulgated by the CFPB. Compliance with any such new regulations would

    <TD><I>Deposit insurance</I>. The Dodd-Frank Act makes permanent the general $250,000 deposit
insurance limit for insured deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act also extends until January&nbsp;1,
2013, federal deposit coverage for the full net amount held by depositors in non-interest
bearing transaction accounts. Amendments to the FDI Act also revise the assessment base
against which an insured depository institution&#146;s deposit insurance premiums paid to the
Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;DIF&#148;) will be calculated. Under the amendments, the assessment
base will no longer be the institution&#146;s deposit base, but rather its average consolidated
total assets less its average tangible equity. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act makes
changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from
1.15&nbsp;percent to 1.35&nbsp;percent of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and
eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the
reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. Several of these provisions could increase the
FDIC deposit insurance premiums paid by BankAtlantic.</TD>

Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of &#147;covered transactions&#148; and an
increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit
transactions must be satisfied. Insider transaction limitations are expanded through the
strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of
transactions subject to the various limits, including derivatives transactions, repurchase
agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions.
Restrictions are also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an
institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain
circumstances, approved by the institution&#146;s board of directors.</TD>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented over time and most will be
subject to regulations adopted over the course of several years. Given the uncertainty associated
with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various
regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will
have on our operations is uncertain. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the
profitability of our business activities, require changes to our business practices, impose more
stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business.
These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to
evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements.
Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and
financial condition.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic is a federal savings association and is subject to extensive regulation,
examination, and supervision by the OTS, as its chartering agency and primary regulator, and the
FDIC, as its deposit insurer. BankAtlantic&#146;s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits
by the FDIC, which is administered by the FDIC. BankAtlantic must file reports with the OTS and the
FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition. Additionally, BankAtlantic must obtain
regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or
acquisitions of, other depository institutions, and must submit applications or notices prior to
forming certain types of subsidiaries or engaging in certain activities through its subsidiaries.
The OTS and the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to assess BankAtlantic&#146;s safety and soundness
and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a
comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings association can engage and is intended
primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The OTS and the FDIC have
significant discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and
examination policies. Any change in such applicable activities or policies, whether by the OTS, the
FDIC or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on BFC, BankAtlantic Bancorp and
BankAtlantic, and the operations of each company.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent changes in law will shift principal regulatory jurisdiction over thrift institutions,
including BankAtlantic (and as discussed above, BFC and BankAtlantic Bancorp) from the OTS to the
OCC during 2011. We are in the process of evaluating the potential implications of this shift in
regulatory jurisdiction, such as possible changes in how BankAtlantic&#146;s regulators will examine it
and what new or different standards they may apply to BankAtlantic. Because BankAtlantic does not
have plans to convert to a national bank, we currently believe the existing OTS regulations will
initially continue to apply to BankAtlantic, although the OCC may decide to modify these
regulations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic may also establish service corporations to engage in activities not otherwise
permissible for BankAtlantic, including certain real estate equity investments and securities and
insurance brokerage. These investment powers are subject to limitations, including, among others,
limitations that require debt securities acquired by
BankAtlantic to meet certain rating criteria and that limit BankAtlantic&#146;s aggregate
investment in various types of loans to certain percentages of capital and/or assets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Loans to One Borrower</I>. Under HOLA, savings associations are generally subject to the same
limits on loans to one borrower as are imposed on national banks. Generally, under these limits,
the total amount of loans and extensions of credit made by a savings association to one borrower or
related group of borrowers outstanding at one time and not fully secured by collateral may not
exceed 15% of the savings association&#146;s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. In addition to,
and separate from, the 15% limitation, the total amount of loans and extensions of credit made by a
savings association to one borrower or related group of borrowers outstanding at one time and fully
secured by readily-marketable collateral may not exceed 10% of the savings association&#146;s unimpaired
capital and unimpaired surplus. Readily-marketable collateral includes certain debt and equity
securities and bullion, but generally does not include real estate. At December&nbsp;31, 2010,
BankAtlantic&#146;s limit on loans to one borrower was approximately $57.0&nbsp;million. At December&nbsp;31,
2010, BankAtlantic&#146;s largest aggregate amount of loans to one borrower was approximately $35.6
million and the second largest borrower had an aggregate balance of approximately $32.1&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QTL Test</I>. HOLA requires a savings association to meet a QTL test by maintaining at least 65%
of its &#147;portfolio assets&#148; in certain &#147;qualified thrift investments&#148; on a monthly average basis in
at least nine months out of every twelve months. A savings association that fails the QTL test
must either operate under certain restrictions on its activities or convert to a bank charter. The
Dodd-Frank Act imposes additional restrictions on the ability of any savings association that fails
to become or remain a QTL to pay dividends. Specifically, the savings association is not only
subject to the general dividend restrictions as would apply to a national bank (as under prior
law), but also is prohibited from paying dividends at all (regardless of financial condition)
unless required to meet the obligations of a company that controls the thrift, permissible for a
national bank and specifically approved by the OCC and the Federal Reserve. In addition,
violations of the QTL test now are treated as violations of federal banking laws subject to
enforcement action. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic maintained approximately 73% of its
portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments. BankAtlantic had also satisfied the QTL test in
each of the nine months prior to December&nbsp;2010 and, therefore, was a QTL.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">currently applicable to U.S.
insured depository institutions and U.S. bank holding companies will in the future become

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Limitation on Capital Distributions</I>. The OTS regulations impose limitations upon certain
capital distributions by savings associations, such as certain cash dividends, payments to
repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares, payments to shareholders of another institution in a
cash-out merger and other distributions charged against capital.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OTS regulates all capital distributions by BankAtlantic directly or indirectly to
BankAtlantic Bancorp, including dividend payments generally.
BankAtlantic currently must file an application to receive the approval of the OTS for a
proposed capital distribution, as the total amount of all of BankAtlantic&#146;s capital distributions (including any proposed capital distribution) for the applicable calendar year
exceeds BankAtlantic&#146;s net income for that year-to-date period plus BankAtlantic&#146;s retained net
income for the preceding two years.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations restrict the payment of dividends by financial institutions if, after paying those
dividends, it would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk-based capital guidelines
and the minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements, or in the event the financial
institution was notified by regulators that it was in need of more than normal supervision. Under
the FDI Act, an insured depository institution, such as BankAtlantic, is prohibited from making
capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the
institution would become &#147;undercapitalized.&#148; Payment of dividends by BankAtlantic also may be
restricted at any time at the discretion of the appropriate regulator if it deems the payment to
constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes
additional restrictions on the ability of any savings association that fails to become or remain a
QTL to pay dividends. The Bank Order and the Company Order current prohibit BankAtlantic and
BankAtlantic Bancorp from paying dividends or other capital distributions without the prior written
non-objection of the Regional Director of the OTS. In addition, BFC has committed that it will
not, without the prior written non-objection of the OTS, pay any dividends or make any other
capital distributions other than dividends on BFC&#146;s 5% preferred stock consistent with its
historical practice.

has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help
meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods.
The CRA requires the OTS to assess the institution&#146;s record of meeting the credit needs of its
community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the
institution. This assessment focuses on three tests:

&#147;substantial non-compliance.&#148; The CRA requires all institutions to disclose their CRA ratings to
the public. BankAtlantic received a &#147;satisfactory&#148; rating in its most recent CRA evaluation. Regulations also require all institutions
to disclose certain agreements that are in fulfillment of the CRA. BankAtlantic has no such
agreements in place at this time.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Transactions with Related Parties</I>. BankAtlantic&#146;s authority to engage in transactions with
its &#147;affiliates&#148; is limited by Sections&nbsp;23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, or FRA, by
Regulation&nbsp;W of the Federal Reserve Board, or FRB, implementing Sections&nbsp;23A and 23B of the FRA,
and by OTS regulations. BankAtlantic&#146;s authority to engage in transactions with affiliates is
further limited under the Bank Order. The applicable OTS regulations for savings associations
regarding transactions with affiliates generally conform to the requirements of Regulation&nbsp;W, which
is applicable to national banks. In general, an affiliate of a savings association is any company
that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the savings association, other
than the savings association&#146;s subsidiaries. For instance, BFC and BankAtlantic Bancorp are deemed
affiliates of BankAtlantic under these regulations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, Section&nbsp;23A limits the extent to which a savings association may engage in &#147;covered

stock and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to
an amount equal to 20% of the savings association&#146;s capital stock and surplus. A covered

credit from BankAtlantic, BankAtlantic Bancorp and BFC to their executive officers, directors,
controlling shareholders and their related interests. The applicable OTS regulations for savings
associations regarding loans by a savings association to its executive officers, directors and
principal shareholders generally conform to the requirements of Regulation&nbsp;O, which is applicable
to national banks. The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with
affiliates under Section&nbsp;23A and Section&nbsp;23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of
the definition of &#147;covered transactions&#148; and an increase the amount of time for which collateral
requirements regarding covered transactions must be satisfied. The ability of the Federal Reserve
to grant exemptions from these restrictions is also narrowed by the Dodd-Frank Act, including by
requiring coordination with other bank regulators.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Enforcement</I>. Under the FDI Act, the OTS has primary enforcement responsibility over savings
associations and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all &#147;institution-affiliated
parties,&#148; including any controlling stockholder or any shareholder, attorney, appraiser and
accountant who knowingly or recklessly participates in any violation of applicable law or
regulation, breach of fiduciary duty, or certain other wrongful actions that have, or are likely to
have, a significant adverse effect on an insured savings association or cause it more than minimal
loss. In addition, the FDIC has back-up authority to take enforcement action for unsafe and
unsound practices. Formal enforcement action can include the issuance of a capital directive,
cease and desist order, removal of officers and/or directors, institution of proceedings for
receivership or conservatorship and termination of deposit insurance. As

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Examination</I>. A savings institution must demonstrate to the OTS its ability to manage its
compliance responsibilities by establishing an effective and comprehensive oversight and monitoring
program. The degree of compliance oversight and monitoring by the institution&#146;s management impacts
the scope and intensity of the OTS&#146; examinations of the institution. Institutions with significant
management oversight and monitoring of compliance will generally receive less extensive OTS
examinations than institutions with less oversight.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Standards for Safety and Soundness</I>. Pursuant to the requirements of the FDI Act, the OTS,
together with the other federal bank regulatory agencies, has adopted the Interagency Guidelines
Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness, (the &#147;Guidelines&#148;.) The Guidelines establish
general safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls, information and internal
audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset
quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the Guidelines require, among
other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures
specified in the Guidelines. If the OTS determines that a savings association fails to meet any
standard established by the Guidelines, then the OTS may require the savings association to submit
to the OTS an acceptable plan to achieve compliance. If a savings association fails to comply, the
OTS may seek an enforcement order in judicial proceedings and impose civil monetary penalties.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shared National Credit Program</I>. The Shared National Credit Program is an interagency program,
established in 1977, to provide a periodic credit risk assessment of the largest and most complex
syndicated loans held or agented by financial institutions subject to supervision by a federal bank
regulatory agency. The Shared National Credit Program is administered by the FRB, FDIC, OTS and
the OCC. The Shared National Credit Program covers any loan or loan commitment of at least $20
million (i)&nbsp;which is shared under a formal lending agreement by three or more unaffiliated
financial institutions or (ii)&nbsp;a portion of which is sold to two or more unaffiliated financial
institutions with the purchasing financial institutions assuming their pro rata share of the credit
risk. The Shared National Credit Program is designed to provide uniformity and efficiency in the
federal banking agencies&#146; analysis and rating of the largest and most complex credit facilities in
the country by avoiding duplicate credit reviews and ensuring consistency in rating determinations.
The federal banking agencies use a combination of statistical and judgmental sampling techniques to
select borrowers for review each year. The selected borrowers are reviewed and the credit quality
rating assigned by the applicable federal banking agency&#146;s examination team will be reported to
each financial institution that participates in the loan as of the examination date. The assigned
ratings are used during examinations of the other financial institutions to avoid duplicate reviews
and ensure consistent treatment of these loans. BankAtlantic has entered into participations with
respect to certain of its loans and has acquired participations in the loans of other financial
institutions which are subject to this program and accordingly these loans may be subject to this
additional review.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Real Estate Lending Standards</I>. The OTS and the other federal banking agencies adopted
regulations to prescribe standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens on or
interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing the construction of improvements
on real estate. The OTS regulations require each savings association to establish and maintain
written internal real estate lending standards that are consistent with OTS guidelines and with
safe and sound banking practices and which are appropriate to the size of the savings association
and the nature and scope of its real estate lending activities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action</I>. Under the OTS Prompt Corrective Action (&#147;PCA&#148;)
Regulations, the OTS is required to take certain, and is authorized to take other, supervisory
actions against undercapitalized savings associations, such as requiring compliance with a capital
restoration plan, restricting asset growth, acquisitions, branching and new lines of business and,
in extreme cases, appointment of a receiver or conservator. The severity of the action required or
authorized to be taken increases as a savings association&#146;s capital deteriorates. Under PCA
regulations, savings associations are classified into five categories of capitalization as &#147;well
capitalized,&#148; &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; &#147;undercapitalized,&#148; &#147;significantly undercapitalized,&#148; and

during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. However, the Bank Order requires that BankAtlantic

(except for the limited rulemaking authority transferred to the Federal Reserve). Although the
federal banking agencies have substantially similar capital adequacy standards and utilize the same
accounting standards, some differences in capital standards exist, such as the regulatory treatment

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OTS regulations do not require savings and loan holding companies, such as BankAtlantic
Bancorp, to maintain specific minimum capital ratios. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act,
risk-based and leverage capital standards currently applicable to U.S. insured depository
institutions and U.S. bank holding companies will in the future become applicable to savings and
loan holding companies such as BankAtlantic Bancorp. The Dodd-Frank Act generally authorizes the
Federal Reserve to promulgate capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies to adopt capital
requirements which address the risks that the activities of an institution poses to the institution
and public and private stakeholders. The federal banking agencies may change existing capital
guidelines or adopt new capital guidelines in the future pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act or other
regulatory or supervisory changes.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Insurance of Deposit Accounts</I>. Savings associations are subject to a risk-based assessment
system for determining the deposit insurance assessments to be paid by them.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until December&nbsp;31, 2006, the FDIC had assigned each savings institution to one of three
capital categories based on the savings institution&#146;s financial information as of its most recent
quarterly financial report filed with the applicable bank regulatory agency prior to the assessment
period. The FDIC had also assigned each savings institution to one of three supervisory
subcategories within each capital category based upon a supervisory evaluation provided to the FDIC
by the savings institution&#146;s primary federal regulator and information that the FDIC determined to
be relevant to the savings institution&#146;s financial condition and the risk posed to the previously
existing deposit insurance funds. A savings institution&#146;s deposit insurance assessment rate
depended on the capital category and supervisory subcategory to which it was assigned. Insurance
assessment rates ranged from 0.00% of deposits for a savings institution in the highest category
(i.e., well capitalized and financially sound, with no more than a few minor weaknesses) to 0.27%
of deposits for a savings institution in the lowest category (i.e., undercapitalized and
substantial supervisory concern).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;1, 2007, the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005, or the Reform Act,
became effective. The Reform Act, among other things, merged the Bank Insurance Fund and the
Savings Association Insurance Fund, both of which were administered by the FDIC, into a new fund
administered by the FDIC, the DIF, and increased the coverage limit for certain retirement plan
deposits to $250,000, but maintained the basic insurance coverage limit of $100,000 for other
depositors. On October&nbsp;3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, or the
Stabilization Act, temporarily raised the basic insurance coverage limit to $250,000. The
Dodd-Frank Act makes permanent the $250,000 insurance limit for insured deposits. Also as a result
of the Dodd-Frank Act, unlimited coverage for non-interest bearing demand transaction accounts will
be provided until January&nbsp;1, 2013.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Reform Act, the FDIC now assigns each savings institution to one of four
risk categories based upon the savings institution&#146;s capital evaluation and supervisory evaluation.
The capital evaluation is based upon financial information as of the savings institution&#146;s most
recent quarterly financial report filed with the applicable bank regulatory agency at the end of
each quarterly assessment period. The supervisory evaluation is based upon the results of
examination findings by the savings institution&#146;s primary federal regulator and information that
the FDIC has determined to be relevant to the savings institution&#146;s financial condition and the
risk posed to the DIF. A savings institution&#146;s deposit insurance base assessment rate depends on
the risk category to which it is assigned. In April&nbsp;2009, the FDIC implemented regulations to
improve the way its insurance base assessment rates differentiate risk among

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">insured institutions
and make the risk-based system fairer by limiting the subsidization of riskier institutions by
safer institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act changes the way an insured depository institution&#146;s deposit
insurance premiums are calculated. Because the new base assessment under the Dodd-Frank Act is
larger than the current insurance base assessment, the proposed assessment rates are lower than the
current rates. The insurance base assessment will no longer be the way an insured depository
institution&#146;s deposit premiums are calculated. For the quarter which began January&nbsp;1, 2011,
insurance base assessment rates range from 12 cents per $100 (but could be as low as 7 cents per
$100, after computing applicable adjustments) in assessable deposits for a savings institution in
the least risk category to 45 cents per $100 (but could be as high as 77.5 cents per $100, after
computing applicable adjustments) in assessable
deposits for a savings institution in the most risk category. BankAtlantic&#146;s FDIC deposit
insurance premium increased from $2.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 to $10.1&nbsp;million
for the same 2010 period. BankAtlantic expects its FDIC insurance premium to further increase
during 2011 from the amounts assessed during 2010 based on its last OTS examination report.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIC is authorized to raise the assessment rates in certain circumstances, which would
affect savings institutions in all risk categories. The FDIC is also authorized to impose special
assessments. The FDIC has exercised its authority to raise assessment rates and impose special
assessments several times in the past, including a $2.4&nbsp;million assessment during 2009. There was
no corresponding assessment during 2010. The FDIC could raise rates and impose special assessments
in the future. Increases in deposit insurance premiums and the imposition of special assessments
would have an adverse effect on our earnings. Amendments to the FDI Act also revise the assessment
base against which an insured depository institution&#146;s deposit insurance premiums paid to DIF will
be calculated. Under the amendments, the assessment base will no longer be the institution&#146;s
deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity.
Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act makes changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF,
increasing the minimum from 1.15&nbsp;percent to 1.35&nbsp;percent of the estimated amount of total insured
deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions
when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued action by the FDIC to replenish the DIF as well as the changes contained in the
Dodd-Frank Act may result in higher assessment rates, which could reduce our profitability or
otherwise negatively impact our operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Privacy and Security Protection</I>. BankAtlantic is subject to regulations implementing the
privacy and security protection provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA. These
regulations require a savings association to disclose to its customers and consumers its policy and
practices with respect to the privacy, and sharing with nonaffiliated third parties, of its
customers and consumers&#146; &#147;nonpublic personal information.&#148; Additionally, in certain instances,
BankAtlantic is required to provide its customers and consumers&#146; with the ability to &#147;opt-out&#148; of
having BankAtlantic share their nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties.
These regulations also require savings associations to maintain policies and procedures to
safeguard their customers and consumers&#146; nonpublic personal information. BankAtlantic has policies
and procedures designed to comply with GLBA and applicable privacy and security regulations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Insurance Activities</I>. BankAtlantic is generally permitted to engage in certain insurance
activities through its subsidiaries. OTS regulations implemented pursuant to GLBA prohibit, among
other things, depository institutions from conditioning the extension of credit to individuals upon
either the purchase of an insurance product or annuity or an agreement by the consumer not to
purchase an insurance product or annuity from an entity that is not affiliated with the depository
institution. The regulations also require prior disclosure of this prohibition to potential
insurance product or annuity customers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Federal Home Loan Bank System</I>. BankAtlantic is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank, or
FHLB, of Atlanta, which is one of the twelve regional FHLB&#146;s composing the FHLB system. Each FHLB
provides a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions as well as other entities
involved in home mortgage lending. Any advances from a FHLB must be secured by specified types of
collateral, and all long-term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for
residential housing finance. As a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, BankAtlantic is required to
acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB of Atlanta. BankAtlantic was in compliance
with this requirement with an investment in FHLB of Atlanta stock at December&nbsp;31, 2010 of
approximately $43.6&nbsp;million. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, the FHLB of Atlanta paid
dividends of approximately $0.1&nbsp;million on the capital stock held by BankAtlantic.

regulations, pursuant to which depository institutions may be required to maintain
non-interest-earning reserves against their deposit accounts and certain other liabilities.
Currently, federal savings associations must maintain reserves against transaction accounts
(primarily NOW and regular interest and non-interest bearing checking accounts). The FRB
regulations establish the specific rates of reserves that must be maintained, which are subject to
adjustment by the FRB. BankAtlantic is currently in compliance with those reserve requirements.
The required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash, a non-interest-bearing account
at a Federal Reserve Bank, or a pass-through account as defined by the FRB. The FRB pays targeted
federal funds rates on the required reserves which are lower than the yield on our traditional
investments.

of the CIP are identification, verification, government list comparison, notice and record
retention. The purpose of the CIP is to enable the financial institution to determine the true
identity and anticipated account activity of each customer. To make this determination, among
other things, the financial institution must collect certain information from customers at the
time they enter into the customer relationship with the financial institution. This information
must be verified within a reasonable time through documentary and non-documentary methods.
Furthermore, all customers must be screened against any CIP-related government lists of known or
suspected terrorists.

entities do not engage in transactions with &#147;enemies&#148; of the United States, as defined by various
Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC has sent banking regulatory agencies lists of names of
persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts. If
BankAtlantic identifies a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC

continue to incur cash flow deficits in the foreseeable future. We have financed operating cash
flow deficits with available working capital, issuances of equity or debt securities, and with
dividends from our subsidiaries, which we have been dependent upon to fund our operations.
Currently, BankAtlantic Bancorp is restricted from paying dividends and these restrictions will
continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, Bluegreen has historically not paid dividends on
its common stock. As a result, if cash flow is not sufficient to fund our operating expenses in
the future, we may be forced to continue to reduce operating expenses, to liquidate some of our

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">2011, BankAtlantic Bancorp entered into the Company Order which, among other things, restricts
BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s ability to pay dividends or make any other capital distributions without receiving the
prior written non-objection of the OTS. In addition, during February&nbsp;2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp
elected to exercise its right to defer payments of interest on its trust preferred junior
subordinated debt. BankAtlantic Bancorp is permitted to defer quarterly interest payments for up to
20 consecutive quarters. During the deferral period, BankAtlantic Bancorp is prohibited from paying
dividends to its shareholders, including BFC. While BankAtlantic Bancorp can end the deferral
period at any time, BankAtlantic Bancorp has indicated that it anticipates that it may continue to
defer such interest payments for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, BFC does not expect to
receive dividends from BankAtlantic Bancorp for the foreseeable future.

Future dividends from Bluegreen are subject to approval by Bluegreen&#146;s Board and will depend upon,

rights in connection with our merger.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Florida law, holders of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock who did not vote to approve
our merger with Woodbridge and who properly asserted and exercised their appraisal rights with
respect to their shares (&#147;Dissenting Holders&#148;) are entitled to receive a cash payment in an amount
equal to the fair value of their shares (as determined in accordance with the provisions of Florida
law) in lieu of the shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock which they would otherwise have been
entitled to receive. Dissenting Holders, who owned in the aggregate approximately 4.6&nbsp;million
shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, provided written notice to Woodbridge regarding their
intent to exercise their appraisal rights. In accordance with Florida law, Woodbridge provided
written notices and required forms to the Dissenting Holders setting forth, among other things, its
determination that the fair value of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock immediately prior to the
effectiveness of the merger was $1.10 per share. Dissenting Holders were required to return their
appraisal forms by November&nbsp;10, 2009 and indicate on their appraisal forms whether the Dissenting
Holder chose to (i)&nbsp;accept Woodbridge&#146;s offer of $1.10 per share in cash, or (ii)&nbsp;demand payment of
the fair value estimate determined by the Dissenting Holder plus interest. As of the date of this
filing, one Dissenting Holder which held approximately 400,000 shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock had withdrawn its shares from the appraisal rights process, while the remaining
Dissenting Holders, who collectively held approximately 4.2&nbsp;million shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock, have rejected Woodbridge&#146;s offer of $1.10 per share and requested payment for their
shares based on their respective views of the fair value of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock prior
to the merger. In December&nbsp;2009, the Company recorded a $4.6&nbsp;million liability with a corresponding
reduction to additional paid-in capital representing, in the aggregate, Woodbridge&#146;s offer to the
Dissenting Holders. However, the appraisal rights litigation is currently ongoing and its outcome
is uncertain. As a result, there is no assurance as to the amount of cash that will be required to
be paid to the Dissenting Holders and such amount may be greater than the $4.6&nbsp;million that is
currently accrued. Any significant increase in the obligation to Dissenting Holders who exercised
their appraisal rights could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have experienced and continue to experience net operating losses. Under the Internal
Revenue Code, we may utilize our net operating loss carryforwards in certain circumstances to
offset future taxable income and to reduce federal income tax liability, subject to certain
requirements and restrictions. Our merger with Woodbridge, which was consummated on September&nbsp;21,
2009, resulted in an &#147;ownership change&#148;, as defined in Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As
a result, our ability in the future to use our historic net operating loss carryforwards will be
substantially limited, which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of
operations. We believe that BFC may utilize Woodbridge&#146;s net operating loss carryforwards
following the merger of the companies on September&nbsp;21, 2009. Accordingly, in September&nbsp;2009, our
Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to preserve shareholder value and
protect our ability to use Woodbridge&#146;s net operating loss carryforwards by providing a deterrent
to holders of less than 5% of our common stock from acquiring a 5% or greater ownership interest in
our common stock. However, there is no assurance that the shareholder rights plan will successfully
prevent against an &#147;ownership change&#148; or otherwise preserve our ability to utilize our net
operating loss carryforwards to offset any future taxable income, nor is there any assurance that
we will be in a position to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards in the future even if we

The Class&nbsp;A Common Stock possesses in the aggregate 22% of the total voting power of all our common
stock and the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock possesses in the aggregate the remaining 78% of the total voting
power. These relative voting percentages will remain fixed unless the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock outstanding decreases to 1,800,000 shares, at which time the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock&#146;s
aggregate voting power will increase to 40% and the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock will have the remaining
60%. If the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock outstanding decreases to 1,400,000 shares, the
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock&#146;s aggregate voting power will increase to 53% and the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock
will have the remaining 47%. These relative voting percentages will remain fixed unless the number
of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock outstanding decreases to 500,000 shares, at which time the fixed
voting percentages will be eliminated. These changes in the relative voting power represented by
each class of our common stock are based only on the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock
outstanding. Thus issuances of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock will have no effect on these provisions. If
additional shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock are issued, the disparity between the equity interest
represented by the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock and its voting power will widen. While the amendment
creating this capital structure was approved by our shareholders, the fixed voting percentage
provisions are somewhat unique. If the market does not view this structure favorably, the trading
price and market for our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock would be adversely affected.

our ability to market VOIs and residential homesites.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our business has been adversely affected by unfavorable general economic and industry conditions,
including high unemployment rates and job insecurity, declines in discretionary spending, housing
values and availability of financing, and geopolitical conflicts. If recent recovery trends do
not continue or, economic conditions deteriorate, our business and results may be adversely
impacted, particularly if financing for us or for our customers is unavailable or if changes in
general economic conditions adversely affect our customers&#146; ability to pay amounts owed under our
notes receivable. Further, because our operations are conducted mainly within the vacation
ownership industry, any adverse changes affecting the industry, such as an oversupply of vacation
ownership units, a reduction in demand for such units, changes in travel and vacation patterns,
changes in governmental regulation of the industry, continued disruptions in the credit markets
and unavailability of financing, imposition of increased taxes by governmental authorities, the
declaration of bankruptcy and/or credit defaults by other vacation ownership companies and
negative publicity for the industry, could also have a material adverse effect on our business.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>We would incur substantial losses and our liquidity position could be adversely impacted if the
customers we finance default on their obligations.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Prior to December&nbsp;15, 2008, we did not perform credit checks on the purchasers of our VOIs in
connection with our financing of their purchases. Effective December&nbsp;15, 2008, we implemented a
FICO&#174; score-based credit underwriting program, and we enhanced this credit underwriting program
during January&nbsp;2010. While our loan portfolio originated after December&nbsp;15, 2008 has experienced
defaults at a lower rate than loans originated prior to that date, there is no assurance that our
FICO&#174; score-based underwriting standards will result in decreased default rates or otherwise
result in the improved performance of our receivables. The conditions in the mortgage industry,
including both credit sources as well as borrowers&#146; financial profiles, have deteriorated in
recent years. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, approximately 4.8% of our vacation ownership receivables
and approximately 11.5% of residential land receivables were more than 30&nbsp;days past due.
Although in many cases we may have recourse against a buyer for the unpaid purchase price,
certain states have laws that limit our ability to recover personal judgments against customers
who have defaulted on their loans or the cost of doing so may not be justified. Historically, we
have generally not pursued such recourse against our customers. In the case of our VOI
receivables, if we are unable to collect the defaulted amount due, we traditionally have
terminated the customer&#146;s interest in the Bluegreen Vacation Club and then remarketed the
recovered VOI. Irrespective of our remedy in the event of a default, we cannot recover the
marketing, selling and administrative costs associated with the original sale. In addition, we
will need to incur such costs again in order to resell the VOI or homesite. In 2010, we recorded
charges of approximately $69.7&nbsp;million to increase our provision for loan losses. If default
rates for our borrowers remain at current levels or increase, it may require an increase in the
provision for loan losses. In addition, it may cause buyers of, or lenders whose loans are
secured by, our VOI notes receivable to reduce the amount of availability under receivables
purchase and credit facilities, or to increase the interest costs associated with such
facilities. In such an event, the cost of financing may increase and we may not be able to
secure financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all, which would adversely affect our earnings,
financial position and liquidity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Under the terms of our pledged and receivable sale facilities, we may be required, under certain
circumstances, to replace receivables or to pay down the loan to within permitted loan-to-value
ratios. Additionally, the terms of our securitization-type transactions i.) require us to
repurchase or replace loans if we breach any of the representations and warranties we made at the
time we sold the receivables and ii.) include provisions that in the event of defaults by
customers in excess of stated thresholds would require substantially all of our cash flow from
our retained interest in the receivable portfolios sold to be paid to the parties who purchased
the receivables from us. In addition, we guaranteed certain payments under the Legacy
Securitization (described in further detail in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>While we have attempted to restructure our business to reduce our need for and reliance on
financing for liquidity in the short term, there is no assurance that such restructuring will be
successful or that our business and profitability will not otherwise continue to depend on our
ability to obtain financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We offer financing of up to 90% of the purchase price to purchasers of our VOIs and homesites.
However, we incur selling, marketing and administrative cash expenditures prior to and concurrent
with the sale. These costs generally exceed the down payment we receive at the time of the sale.
Accordingly, our ability to borrow against or sell the notes receivable we receive from our
customers has been a critical factor in our continued liquidity, and we therefore have
historically depended on funds from our credit facilities and securitization transactions to
finance our operations. The disruption in the credit markets since 2007 has made obtaining
additional and replacement external sources of liquidity more difficult and more costly. The
number of banks and other finance companies willing to provide &#147;warehouse&#148; lines of credit for
timeshare receivables has decreased in recent years. In addition, the term securitization market
has become unavailable for extended periods of time in the past. If our pledged receivables
facilities terminate or expire and we are unable to extend them or replace them with comparable
facilities, or if we are unable to continue to participate in securitization-type transactions and
&#147;warehouse&#148; facilities on acceptable terms, our liquidity, cash flow, and profitability would be
materially and adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, financing for real estate acquisition and development and the capital markets for
corporate debt have been limited. In response to these conditions, during 2008, we adopted
initiatives which included limiting sales and encouraging higher down payments on sales, in an
attempt to conserve cash. We also have increased our focus on expanding our fee-based service
business. However, there is no assurance that our implementation of these initiatives will enhance
our financial position or otherwise be successful. If these initiatives do not have their
intended results, our financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, notwithstanding our implementation of the initiatives implemented since 2008 to
improve our cash position, we anticipate that we will continue to seek and use external sources of
liquidity, including funds that we obtain pursuant to additional borrowings under our existing
credit facilities, under credit facilities that we may obtain in the future, under securitizations
in which we may participate in the future or pursuant to other borrowing arrangements, to:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The adverse trends experienced in the real estate market since 2007 have exerted pressure upon
our Bluegreen Communities and Bluegreen Resorts divisions. Particularly, low consumer demand
for homesites has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on Bluegreen Communities&#146;
operations. Further, while general economic trends have recently shown signs of improvement, a
deterioration in general economic conditions or continued adverse conditions in the real estate
market would have a material adverse effect on our business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">To the extent we decide to acquire more real estate inventory in the future for eventual sale by
Bluegreen Resorts or Bluegreen Communities, the availability of land at favorable prices at that
time will be critical to our profitability and the ability to cover our significant selling,
general and administrative expenses, cost of capital and other expenses. If we are unable to
acquire such land or, in the case of Bluegreen Resorts, resort properties, at a favorable cost,
it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. While we believe that the property
we have purchased at our adjusted carrying amounts will generate appropriate margins, land prices
remain significantly below historical levels, and the projects we acquired prior to or during the
recent economic downturn may have been purchased at higher price levels than available in the
current market.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The profitability of our real estate development activities is also impacted by the cost of
construction materials and services. Should the cost of construction materials and services
rise, the ultimate cost of our Bluegreen Resorts&#146; and Bluegreen Communities&#146; inventories when
developed could increase and have a material, adverse impact on our results of operations.

results of operations and financial condition.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In July&nbsp;2009, we began offering fee-based marketing and sales services to third-party developers.
During 2010, we continued to expand our fee-based service business, which we believe enables us to
leverage our expertise in sales and marketing, resort management, mortgage servicing, construction
management and title services. We currently intend for our fee-based services to become an
increasing portion of our resorts business over time as they generally produce positive cash flow
and typically require less capital investment than our traditional vacation ownership business. We
have attempted to structure these activities to cover our costs and generate a profit. However,
our fee-based services business remains relatively new and we have limited experience in its
pricing and operation. In addition, while our fee-based marketing and sales services do not
require us to use our receivable credit facility capacity, our clients do typically have to
maintain their own receivable-backed credit facilities. Should our clients not be able to maintain
said facilities, our fee-based marketing and sales business could be materially adversely impacted.
Alternatively, we could attempt to structure other arrangements where we would utilize our
receivable credit facilities in order to provide fee-based marketing and sales services, which
would reduce the credit otherwise available to us. In addition, when we perform fee-based sales
and marketing services, we sell VOIs in a resort developed by a third party as an interest in the
Bluegreen Vacation Club. This subjects us to a number of risks typically associated with selling
products developed by others under your own brand name, including litigation risks. Additionally,
demand for the third party resorts may be below our expectations and the third party developers may
not satisfy their obligations. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by performing due
diligence on the resorts in which we sell VOIs and by typically performing resort management
services at those resorts, there is no assurance that we will be successful in mitigating or
managing the risks, which may have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and
financial condition. For these and

Bluegreen Resorts does not continue to participate in exchange networks or its customers are not

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">All of our VOI resorts are currently affiliated with RCI, and most of our Club Resorts have been
awarded RCI&#146;s highest designation (Gold Crown). A VOI owner&#146;s participation in the RCI exchange
network allows an owner to exchange their annual VOI for occupancy at over 4,000 participating
resorts, based upon availability and the owner payment of a variable exchange fee. In 2010,
approximately 6% of our owners utilized the RCI exchange network for an exchange of two or more
nights. We also have a joint venture with Shell, called Select Connections&#153;, which currently gives
Bluegreen Vacation Club members who acquired or upgraded their VOIs on or after November&nbsp;1, 2007
access to 21 Shell resorts and provides members of Shell access to Bluegreen Vacation Club resorts.
In addition, certain Bluegreen Vacation Club members may use their points for a variety of hotel
stays, RV site stays within the Coast to Coast network, or various cruise vacations. There is no
assurance that our resorts will continue to participate in the RCI or Select Connections&#153; exchange
networks in which they currently participate or through which Bluegreen Vacation Club members have
access to alternative vacation destinations. There is also no assurance that any or all of these
networks will continue to operate effectively or that our customers will continue to be satisfied
with the networks. If any of these events should occur, our results of operations and financial
condition may be materially and adversely impacted.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;24, 2011, we announced that we had engaged advisors to explore strategic alternatives
for Bluegreen Communities, including a possible sale of the division. There is no assurance
regarding the timing or success of pursuing any of the alternatives we may consider, or that any
such alternatives, if pursued and ultimately consummated, will result in improvements to our
financial condition and operating results or otherwise achieve the benefits hoped to be realized
from the transaction. Further, the strategic review process may divert management&#146;s attention
from our other business activities, result in the loss of key employees, result in decreased
consumer demand or other unforeseen consequences. To the extent that additional market
information is obtained during the strategic review process which indicates that the carrying
value of our Communities&#146; inventory exceeds its fair value, additional impairment charges
relating to the value of the inventory may result. The occurrence of any of these events could
have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We engage third-party contractors to construct our resorts and to develop our communities.
However, our customers may assert claims against us for construction defects or other perceived
development defects, including, without limitation, structural integrity, the presence of mold as
a result of leaks or other defects, water intrusion, asbestos, electrical issues, plumbing
issues, road construction, water and sewer defects and defects in the engineering of amenities.
In addition, certain state and local laws may impose liability on property developers with
respect to development defects discovered in the future. We could have to accrue a significant
portion of the cost to repair such defects in the quarter when such defects arise or when the
repair costs are reasonably estimable. A significant number of claims for development-related
defects could adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and operating results.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Based on our experience at our resorts and at destination resorts owned by third parties, we
believe that resales of VOIs generally are made at net sales prices below their original customer
purchase prices. The relatively lower sales prices are partly attributable to the high marketing
and sales costs associated with the initial sales of such VOIs. Accordingly, the initial
purchase of a VOI may be less attractive to prospective buyers. Also, buyers who seek to resell
their VOIs compete with our efforts to sell our VOIs. While VOI resale clearing houses or
brokers currently do not have a material impact on our business, if a secondary market for VOIs
were to become more organized and liquid, the resulting availability of resale VOIs at lower
prices could adversely affect our sales prices and the number of sales we can close, which in
turn would adversely affect our business and results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, the federal government and the states and local jurisdictions in which we conduct
business have generally enacted extensive regulations relating to direct marketing and
telemarketing, including the federal government&#146;s national &#147;Do Not Call&#148; list. The regulations
have impacted our marketing of VOIs, and we have taken steps in an attempt to decrease our
dependence on restricted calls. However, these steps have increased and are expected to continue
to increase our marketing costs. We cannot predict the impact that these legislative initiatives
or any other legislative measures that may be proposed or enacted in the future may have on our
marketing strategies and results. Further, from time to time, complaints are filed against the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Currently, most states have taxed VOIs as real estate, imposing property taxes that are billed to
the respective property owners&#146; associations that maintain the related resorts and have not
sought to impose sales tax upon the sale of the VOI or accommodations tax upon the use of the
VOI. From time to time, however, various states have attempted to promulgate new laws or apply
existing laws impacting the taxation of vacation ownership interests to require that sales or
accommodations taxes be collected. Should new state or local laws be implemented or interpreted
to impose sales or accommodations taxes on VOIs, our resorts business could be materially
adversely affected.

BankAtlantic would be required to submit a contingency plan that is acceptable to the OTS and that

BankAtlantic would be required to implement the contingency plan upon written notification from

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has incurred losses of $145.5&nbsp;million, $185.8&nbsp;million and $202.6&nbsp;million
during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, December&nbsp;31, 2009 and December&nbsp;31, 2008, respectively. As
part of its efforts to maintain regulatory capital ratios, BankAtlantic has reduced its assets and
repaid borrowings. However, the reduction of earning asset balances has resulted in reduced income,

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parent Company contributed $28&nbsp;million and $105&nbsp;million to the capital of BankAtlantic
during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and December&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively. At December&nbsp;31,
2010, the Parent Company had $12.2&nbsp;million of liquid assets. While a wholly-owned work-out
subsidiary of the Parent Company also holds a portfolio of approximately $13.7&nbsp;million of
non-performing loans, net of reserves, $2.8&nbsp;million of performing loans and $10.2&nbsp;million of real
estate owned which it could seek to liquidate, the Parent Company&#146;s sources of funds to continue to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parent Company&#146;s ability to contribute additional capital to BankAtlantic will depend on
its ability to raise capital in the secondary markets and on its ability to liquidate its portfolio
of non-performing loans and real estate owned. Its ability to raise additional capital will depend
on, among other things, conditions in the financial markets at the time, which are outside of our
control, and our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The entry into the
Orders may also make it more difficult to raise additional capital. Such capital may not be
available to us on acceptable terms or at all. The Parent Company may not be able to provide
additional capital, as needed, to BankAtlantic and BankAtlantic may not be able to raise needed
capital directly. The failure to obtain capital in amounts needed to meet the higher capital
requirements under the Bank Order would cause BankAtlantic to fail to comply with the Bank Order
and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the need for the Parent Company to be in a position to provide capital to
BankAtlantic, as well as the anticipated imposition of capital requirements on thrift holding
companies under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Parent Company has and will continue to evaluate raising
additional funds through the issuance of securities. Any such financing could be obtained through
additional public offerings, private offerings, in privately negotiated transactions, through a
rights offering or otherwise. We could also pursue these financings at the Parent Company level or
directly at BankAtlantic or both. Issuances of equity directly at BankAtlantic would dilute the
Parent Company&#146;s interest in BankAtlantic. During February&nbsp;2010, we filed a shelf registration
statement with the SEC registering up to $75&nbsp;million of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and/or other
securities in the future. We currently have $55&nbsp;million remaining on this shelf registration
statement. Additionally, in September&nbsp;2010, the Parent Company filed a separate registration
statement on Form S-1 with the SEC for registering $125&nbsp;million of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. The Form
S-1 registration statement has not yet been declared effective. Because our decision to issue
securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our
control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. The
terms and pricing of any future transaction by the Parent Company or BankAtlantic could result in
additional substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. As a result, our shareholders bear
the risks of future offerings at the Parent Company level reducing the price of our Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock, and diluting their holdings in the Company, and future offerings directly at BankAtlantic
diluting the Parent Company&#146;s interest in BankAtlantic. Additionally, depending on the amount of
shares issued in any future offering, the Company&#146;s ability to use its NOLs in future periods may
be substantially limited.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continued deterioration of economic conditions in the Florida residential real estate
market, including the continued decline in median home prices year-over-year in all major
metropolitan areas in Florida, and the downturn in the Florida commercial real estate market,
resulted in a substantial increase in BankAtlantic&#146;s non-performing assets and provision for loan
losses over the past three years. The housing industry has been in a substantial and prolonged
downturn reflecting, in part, decreased availability of mortgage financing for residential home
buyers, reduced demand for new construction resulting in a significant over-supply of housing
inventory and increased foreclosure rates. Additionally, the deteriorating condition of the Florida
economy and these adverse market conditions have negatively impacted the commercial non-residential
real estate market. BankAtlantic&#146;s earnings and financial condition were adversely impacted over
the past three years as the majority of its loans are secured by real estate in Florida. We expect
that our earnings and financial condition will continue to be unfavorably impacted if market
conditions do not improve or deteriorate further in Florida. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic&#146;s
loan portfolio included $305.7&nbsp;million of non-accrual loans concentrated in Florida.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Our loan portfolio is concentrated in loans secured by real estate, a majority of which are located

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditions in the United States real estate market have deteriorated significantly beginning
in 2007, particularly in Florida, BankAtlantic&#146;s primary lending area. BankAtlantic&#146;s loan
portfolio is concentrated in commercial real estate loans (most of which are located in Florida and
many of which involve residential land development), residential mortgages (nationwide), and
consumer home-equity loans (throughout BankAtlantic&#146;s markets in Florida). BankAtlantic has a
heightened exposure to credit losses that may arise from this concentration as a result of the
significant downturn in the Florida real estate markets. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic&#146;s loan
portfolio included $2.1&nbsp;billion of loans concentrated in Florida, which represented approximately
64% of its loan portfolio.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that BankAtlantic&#146;s commercial residential loan portfolio has exposure to further
declines in the Florida real estate market. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010: (i)&nbsp;the &#147;builder land bank
loan&#148; category held by BankAtlantic consisted of 4 loans aggregating $10.6&nbsp;million, all of which
were on non-accrual; (ii)&nbsp;the &#147;land acquisition and development loan&#148; category held by
BankAtlantic consisted of 24 loans aggregating $118.8&nbsp;million, of which thirteen loans totaling
$61.9&nbsp;million were on non-accrual; (iii)&nbsp;the &#147;land acquisition, development and construction loan&#148;
category held by BankAtlantic consisted of 3 loans aggregating $3.5&nbsp;million, none of which were on
non-accrual.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the loans described above, during 2008, the Parent Company formed an asset
workout subsidiary which acquired non-performing commercial residential real estate loans from
BankAtlantic. The balance of these non-performing loans as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 was $14.5&nbsp;million,
including $3.7&nbsp;million, $3.6&nbsp;million and $1.6&nbsp;million of &#147;builder land bank loans&#148;, &#147;land
acquisition and development loans&#148;, and &#147;land acquisition, development and construction loans&#148;,
respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market conditions have resulted in, and may in the future result in, our commercial real
estate borrowers having difficulty selling lots or homes in their developments for an extended
period, which in turn could result in an increase in residential construction loan delinquencies
and non-accrual balances. Additionally, if the current depressed economic environment continues or
deteriorates further, collateral values may decline further which likely would result in increased
credit losses in these loans.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in the commercial and construction and development real estate loan portfolio are
approximately $781.6&nbsp;million of commercial non-residential and commercial land loans. A borrower&#146;s
ability to repay commercial land loans is dependent on the success of the real estate project. A
borrower&#146;s ability to repay commercial non-residential loans is dependent upon maintaining tenants
through the life of the loan or the borrower&#146;s successful operation of a business. Weak economic
conditions may impair a borrower&#146;s business operations and typically slow the execution of new
leases. Such economic conditions may also lead to existing lease turnover. As a result of these
factors, vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space are expected to continue to rise in
2011 which could result in falling rents. The combination of these factors could result in further
deterioration in real estate market conditions and BankAtlantic may recognize higher credit losses
on these loans, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s commercial real estate loan portfolio includes 10 large lending relationships
totaling $266&nbsp;million, including relationships with unaffiliated borrowers involving lending
commitments in each case in excess of $20&nbsp;million. Defaults by any of these borrowers could have a
material adverse effect on BankAtlantic&#146;s results.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>The Parent Company has deferred interest on its outstanding junior subordinated debentures and
anticipates that it will continue to defer this interest for the foreseeable future, which could
adversely affect its financial condition and liquidity.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parent Company began deferring interest on all of its $294&nbsp;million of junior subordinated
debentures as of March&nbsp;2009 which resulted in the deferral and accrual of $28.2&nbsp;million of
regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments that would otherwise have been paid during the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009. The terms of the junior subordinated debentures allow the
Parent Company to defer interest payments for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods, and the
Parent Company anticipates that it will continue to defer such interest for the foreseeable future.
During the deferral period, interest continues to accrue on the junior subordinated debentures, as
well as on the deferred interest, at the relevant stated coupon rate, and at the end of the
deferral period, the Parent Company will be required to pay all interest accrued during the
deferral period. In the event that the Parent Company elects to defer interest on its junior
subordinated debentures for the full 20 consecutive quarterly periods permitted under the terms of
the junior subordinated debentures, the Parent Company would owe approximately $74&nbsp;million of
accrued interest as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 (based on average interest rates applicable at December
31, 2010, which were at historically low interest rate levels). As most of the outstanding junior
subordinated debentures bear interest at rates that are indexed to LIBOR, if LIBOR rates increase,
the interest that would accrue during the deferral period would be significantly higher and
likewise increase the amount the Parent Company would owe at the conclusion of the deferral period.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>BankAtlantic obtained a significant portion of its non-interest income through service charges on
core deposit accounts, and recent legislation designed to limit service charges could reduce our
fee income.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s deposit account growth has generated a substantial amount of service charge
income. The largest component of this service charge income historically has been overdraft fees.
Changes in banking regulations, in particular the Federal Reserve&#146;s new rules prohibiting banks
from automatically enrolling customers in overdraft protection programs, which became effective
July&nbsp;1, 2010, had a significant adverse impact on our service charge income during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010 and this impact is expected to continue in 2011. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act
has established a consumer protection agency which may further limit the assessment of overdraft
fees. Changes in customer behavior, modification of our service charge practices as well as
increased competition from other financial institutions could also result in declines in deposit
accounts or in overdraft frequency resulting in a decline in service charge income. Further, the
downturn in the Florida economy could result in the inability to collect overdraft fees. The
reduction in deposit account fee income during 2010 had an adverse impact on our earnings and
further reductions during 2011 would likewise impact our earnings.

implementation, the effects of which are not yet known. As a result, it is difficult to gauge the
ultimate impact of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act because the implementation of many
concepts is left to regulatory agencies. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

FDIC has increased the deposit insurance assessment rates and raised deposit premiums for insured
depository institutions. In addition, BankAtlantic&#146;s annual insurance rates are expected to
increase in 2011 based on the results of its latest regulatory risk profile. BankAtlantic&#146;s prepaid
insurance assessment was $22.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010. If the economy worsens and the number

changing economic environment. The process of determining the estimated losses inherent in
BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolio requires subjective and complex judgments and the level of
uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect BankAtlantic&#146;s ability to estimate
the losses which may be incurred in its loan portfolio. If BankAtlantic&#146;s evaluation is incorrect
and borrower defaults cause losses exceeding the portion of the allowance for loan losses allocated

increase its allowance for loan losses in the future, our earnings could be significantly and

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic&#146;s allowance for loan losses was $161.3&nbsp;million which
represented approximately 5.08% of total loans and 43.5% of non-performing loans.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010<I>, </I>approximately $550.2&nbsp;million of BankAtlantic&#146;s purchased residential
loan portfolio consisted of interest-only loans, representing approximately 45% of the total
purchased residential loan portfolio. While these loans are not considered sub-prime or negative
amortizing loans, these loans have reduced initial loan payments with the potential for significant
increases in monthly loan payments in subsequent periods, even if interest rates do not rise, as
required amortization of the principal commences. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2011,
approximately $52.1&nbsp;million of the loans in this portfolio will begin principal amortization.
Monthly loan payments also increase if interest rates increase. This presents a potential
repayment risk if the borrower is unable to meet the higher debt service obligations or refinance
the loan. As previously noted, current economic conditions in the residential real estate markets
and the mortgage finance markets have made it more difficult for borrowers to refinance their
mortgages which also increases our exposure to loss.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, the Company&#146;s non-performing loans totaled $385.5&nbsp;million and
$331.0&nbsp;million, or 12.0% and 9.0% of our loan portfolio, respectively. At December&nbsp;31, 2010 and
2009, the Company&#146;s non-performing assets (which include non-performing loans and foreclosed real
estate) were $463.6&nbsp;million and $379.7&nbsp;million, or 10.3% and 7.9% of our total assets,
respectively. In addition, the Company had approximately $38.2&nbsp;million and $72.9&nbsp;million in
accruing loans that were 30-89&nbsp;days delinquent at December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our
non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. Until economic and real
estate market conditions improve, particularly in Florida but also nationally, we expect to
continue to incur additional losses relating to an increase in non-performing loans and
non-performing assets. We generally do not record interest income on non-performing loans or real
estate owned. When we receive the collateral in foreclosures or similar proceedings, we are
required to mark the related collateral to the then fair market value, generally based on
appraisals of the property obtained by us, which often results in an additional loss. These loans
and real estate owned also increase our risk profile, and increases in the level of non-performing
loans and non-performing assets impact our regulators&#146; view of appropriate capital levels, which
was the major contributing factor to the imposition by the OTS of the Orders. Our regulators will
likely require us to maintain enhanced capital levels until, at a minimum, our levels of
non-performing loans and assets are substantially reduced. While we seek to manage our
nonperforming assets, decreases in the value of these assets or

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in residential real estate prices and higher unemployment throughout Florida has,
over the past three years, resulted in an increase in mortgage delinquencies and higher foreclosure
rates. Additionally, in response to the turmoil in the credit markets, financial institutions have
tightened underwriting standards which has limited borrowers&#146; ability to refinance. These
conditions have adversely impacted delinquencies and credit loss trends in BankAtlantic&#146;s home
equity loan portfolio and it does not currently appear that these conditions will improve
significantly in the near term. Approximately 74% of the loans in BankAtlantic&#146;s home equity
portfolio are residential second mortgages that exhibit higher loss severity than residential first
mortgages. If current economic conditions do not improve and home prices continue to fall,
BankAtlantic may continue to experience higher credit losses from this loan portfolio. Since the
collateral for this portfolio consists primarily of second mortgages, it is unlikely that
BankAtlantic will be successful in recovering all or any portion of its loan proceeds in the event
of a default unless BankAtlantic is prepared to repay the first mortgage and such repayment and the
costs associated with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of BankAtlantic&#146;s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, the
earnings and growth of BankAtlantic are significantly affected by interest rates, which are subject
to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign, events in the capital
markets and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies,
particularly the Federal Reserve Board. The nature and timing of any changes in such policies or
general economic conditions and their effect on BankAtlantic cannot be controlled and are extremely
difficult to predict. Changes in interest rates can impact BankAtlantic&#146;s net interest income as
well as the valuation of its assets and liabilities.

particular, changes in market interest rates, changes in the relationships between short-term and
long-term market interest rates, or the yield curve, or changes in the relationships between
different interest rate indices can affect the interest rates charged on interest-earning assets
differently than the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. This difference could
result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income and therefore reduce
BankAtlantic&#146;s net interest income. While BankAtlantic has attempted to structure its asset and
liability management strategies to mitigate the impact on net interest income of changes in market
interest rates, BankAtlantic may not be successful in doing so.

insurance denied insurance coverage for the class action securities litigation on the grounds that
the jury found intentional wrongful acts by certain senior executive officers of the Company. While
the Company disputes the validity of the denial of coverage, the Company does not expect to receive
additional reimbursements for litigation costs associated with class action securities litigation
unless it is successful in contesting the denial of insurance coverage. The insurer and the Company

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic has reduced its assets and repaid borrowings in order to improve its liquidity
and regulatory capital ratios. The reduction of earning asset balances has reduced our net
interest income. Our net interest income was $163.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009

impacted as a result of the downturn in the U.S. housing and commercial real estate markets and
general economic conditions. Dramatic declines in the national and, in particular, Florida housing
markets over the past three years, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and
unemployment, have negatively impacted the credit performance of our loans and resulted in
significant asset impairments at all financial institutions, including government-sponsored
entities, major commercial and investment banks, and regional and community financial institutions
including BankAtlantic. Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally
and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased
providing funding to borrowers, including to other financial institutions. This market turmoil and
tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack
of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity
generally. The continuing economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial
markets has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Further negative market and economic developments may cause
adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which
may impact our charge-offs and provisions for loan losses. Continuing economic deterioration that
affects household and/or corporate incomes could also result in reduced demand for credit or
fee-based products and services. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the
adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on BankAtlantic and others in the financial
services industry. In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:

its Class&nbsp;A Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange. Like many
other companies involved in the financial services industry over the last several years, the
trading price of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock has experienced a substantial decline. A
listed company would be deemed to be below compliance with the continued listing standards of the
New York Stock Exchange if, among other things, the listed company&#146;s average closing price was less
than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading day period or the listed company&#146;s average market
capitalization was less than $15&nbsp;million over a consecutive 30 trading day period. As of February
28, 2011, the average market price of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock over the prior 30 trading
day period was approximately $1.06, and the Company&#146;s average market capitalization over that
period was approximately $65&nbsp;million. However, the market price of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock is subject to significant volatility and it may decrease in the future so as to cause the
Company not to comply with the New York Stock Exchange&#146;s requirement for continued listing.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Company does not meet the requirements for continued listing, then the Company&#146;s Class
A Common Stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. In such case, the Company would
attempt to cause its Class&nbsp;A Common Stock to be eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board.
However, in such event, the trading price of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock would likely be
adversely impacted, it may become more difficult for the holders of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock to sell or purchase shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, and it may become more
difficult for the Company to raise capital, which could materially and adversely impact our
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

our merger with Woodbridge and who properly asserted and exercised their appraisal rights with
respect to their shares (&#147;Dissenting Holders&#148;) are entitled to receive a cash payment in an amount
equal to the fair value of their shares (as determined in accordance with the provisions of Florida
law) in lieu of the shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock which they would otherwise have been
entitled to receive. Dissenting Holders, who owned in the aggregate approximately 4.6&nbsp;million
shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, provided written notice to Woodbridge regarding their
intent to exercise their appraisal rights. In accordance with Florida law, Woodbridge provided
written notices and required forms to the Dissenting Holders setting forth, among other things, its
determination that the fair value of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock immediately prior to the
effectiveness of the merger was $1.10 per share. Dissenting Holders were required to return their
appraisal forms by November&nbsp;10, 2009 and indicate on their appraisal forms whether the Dissenting
Holder chose to (i)&nbsp;accept Woodbridge&#146;s offer of $1.10 per share or (ii)&nbsp;demand payment of the fair
value estimate determined by the Dissenting Holder plus interest. One Dissenting Holder, which held
approximately 400,000 shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, has withdrawn its shares from
the appraisal rights process, while the remaining Dissenting Holders, who collectively held
approximately 4.2&nbsp;million shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, have rejected Woodbridge&#146;s
offer of $1.10 per share and requested payment for their shares based on their respective fair
value estimates of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. In December&nbsp;2009, the Company recorded a $4.6
million liability with a corresponding reduction to additional paid-in capital representing, in the
aggregate, Woodbridge&#146;s offer to the Dissenting Holders. The appraisal rights litigation thereafter
commenced and is currently ongoing. The outcome of the litigation is uncertain and there is no
assurance as to the amount of cash that will be required to be paid to the Dissenting Holders,
which amount may be greater than the $4.6&nbsp;million that we have accrued.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;13, 2010, National Bank of South Carolina filed a complaint in the South Carolina Court
of Common Pleas, Fourteenth Judicial Circuit, to commence foreclosure proceedings related to
property at Tradition Hilton Head which served as collateral under a note and mortgage executed and
delivered by Core South Carolina, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Core, in favor of the lender.
Core was secondarily liable as a guarantor for the loan, and Synovus Bank (successor by merger to
National Bank of South Carolina) commenced an action to enforce Core&#146;s guarantee. With Core&#146;s
concurrence, the property which served as collateral for the loan was placed under the control of a
court-appointed receiver. During December&nbsp;2010, Core and Core South Carolina, on the one hand, and
Synovus Bank, on the other hand, executed agreements, including, without limitation, a Deed in Lieu
of Foreclosure Agreement, which resolved the pending litigation and foreclosure disputes between
them. Pursuant to the agreements, (i)&nbsp;Core South Carolina transferred to Synovus Bank all of Core
South Carolina&#146;s right, title and interest in and to the property which served as collateral for
the loan as well as certain additional real and personal property which had a book value as of
September&nbsp;30, 2010 of approximately $1.0&nbsp;million, and (ii)&nbsp;Synovus Bank released Core and Core
South Carolina from any claims arising from or relating to the loan.

subsequently sold the loan to an investor group. While there may have been an issue with respect to
compliance with certain covenants in the loan documents, we do not believe that an event of default
occurred. Through participation in a court-ordered mediation of this matter, the parties agreed to
tentative terms to settle the matter and are currently negotiating a formal settlement agreement.
It is currently expected that this settlement agreement, if finalized, will provide for (i)
Woodbridge to pay $2.5&nbsp;million to the investor group, (ii)&nbsp;Carolina Oak to convey to the investor
group the real property securing the loan via a stipulated foreclosure or deed in lieu, (iii)&nbsp;the
investor group to release Woodbridge and Carolina Oak from their obligations relating to the debt
or, alternatively, to agree not to pursue certain remedies, including a deficiency judgment, that
would otherwise be available to them, in each case subject to certain conditions, and (iv)&nbsp;the
litigation to be dismissed. There is no assurance that the settlement will be finalized on the
contemplated terms, or at all.

asserting claims under the federal securities law and seeking damages. This action was filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and is captioned Dance v.
Levitt Corp. et al., No.&nbsp;08-CV-60111-DLG. The securities litigation purports to be brought on
behalf of all purchasers of Woodbridge&#146;s securities beginning on January&nbsp;31, 2007 and ending on
August&nbsp;14, 2007. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This litigation arose from a dispute regarding liability under two performance bonds for
infrastructure issued in connection with a plat issued by the City of Brooksville for a single
family housing project that was not commenced. The project had been abandoned by Levitt and Sons
prior to its bankruptcy filing as non-viable as a consequence of the economic downturn and, in
connection with the Levitt and Sons bankruptcy, the mortgagee, Key Bank, was permitted by agreement
to initiate and conclude a foreclosure leading to the acquisition of the property by Key Bank&#146;s
subsidiary. The City of Brooksville contended that, notwithstanding that the development had not
proceeded and was not likely to proceed at any known time in the future, it was entitled to recover
the face amount of the bonds in the approximate amount of $5.4&nbsp;million. Woodbridge filed a suit
for declaratory judgment (in the name of its surety, Westchester) against the City of Brooksville
contending that the obligation under the bonds had terminated. In August&nbsp;2010, Woodbridge was
granted a motion for summary judgment. Subsequent to the motion being granted, the municipality
appealed the decision.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2005, the State of Tennessee Audit Division (the &#147;Division&#148;) audited certain subsidiaries
within Bluegreen Resorts for the period from December&nbsp;1, 2001 through December&nbsp;31, 2004. On
September&nbsp;23, 2006, the Division issued a notice of assessment for approximately $0.7&nbsp;million of
accommodations tax based on the use of Bluegreen Vacation Club accommodations by Bluegreen Vacation
Club members who became members through the purchase of non-Tennessee property. Bluegreen believes
the attempt to impose such a tax is contrary to Tennessee law and have vigorously opposed, and
intend to continue to vigorously oppose, such assessment by the Division. An informal conference
was held in December&nbsp;2007 to discuss this matter with representatives of the Division. No formal
resolution of the issue was reached during the conference and no further action has to date been
initiated by the State of Tennessee. While the timeshare industry has been successful in
challenging the imposition of sales taxes on the use of accommodations by timeshare owners, there
is no assurance that we will be successful in contesting the current assessment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In Cause No.&nbsp;2006-Ca-3374, styled <U>Joseph M. Scheyd, Jr., P.A. vs. Bluegreen Vacations
Unlimited, Inc.; Hubert A. Laird; and MSB of Destin, Inc.,</U>in the Circuit Court of the First
Judicial Circuit in and for Okaloosa County, Florida, the Plaintiff as escrow agent brought an
interpleader action seeking a determination as to whether Bluegreen, as purchaser, or Hubert A.
Laird and MSB of Destin, Inc. as seller, were entitled to the $1.4&nbsp;million escrow deposit being
maintained with the escrow agent pursuant to a purchase and sale contract for real property located
in Destin, Florida. Both Bluegreen and the seller brought cross-claims for breach of the
underlying purchase and sale contract. The seller&#146;s complaint, as amended, includes a fraud
allegation, contends that Bluegreen failed to perform under the terms of the purchase and sale
contract and claims entitlement to the full amount in escrow. Bluegreen maintains that its
decision not to close on the purchase of the property was proper under the terms of the purchase
and sale contract and therefore are entitled to a return of the full escrow deposit. A trial date
of May&nbsp;31, 2011 has been set for this matter. Bluegreen believes the seller&#146;s allegations are
without merit and intends to vigorously defend this claim.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Office of the Attorney General for the State of Florida (the &#147;AGSF&#148;) has advised Bluegreen that
it has accumulated a number of consumer complaints over the past six years against Bluegreen and/or
its affiliates related to its timeshare sales and marketing, and has requested that Bluegreen
respond on a collective basis as to how it had or would resolve the complaints. Bluegreen has
determined that many of these complaints were previously addressed and/or resolved by Bluegreen.
The AGSF has also requested that Bluegreen enter into a written agreement in which the parties
establish a process and timeframe for determining consumer eligibility for relief (including where
applicable monetary restitution, if any). Bluegreen does not believe this matter will have a
material effect on Bluegreen&#146;s results of operations, financial condition or its sales and
marketing activities in Florida.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Bluegreen Southwest One, L.P. (&#147;Southwest&#148;), a subsidiary of Bluegreen Corporation, is the

Lesley et a1. v. Bluff Dale Development Corporation, Bluegreen Southwest One. L.P. et al.,</U> in
the 266th Judicial District Court, Erath County, Texas, the plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment
action against Southwest seeking to develop their reserved mineral interests in, on and under the
Mountain Lakes subdivision. The plaintiffs&#146; claims are based on property law, oil and gas law,
contract and tort theories. The property owners association and some of the individual landowners
have filed cross actions against Bluegreen, Southwest and individual directors of the property
owners association related to the mineral rights and certain amenities in the subdivision as
described below. On January&nbsp;17, 2007, the court ruled that the restrictions placed on the
development that prohibited oil and gas production and development were invalid and not enforceable
as a matter of law, that such restrictions did not prohibit the development of the plaintiffs&#146;
prior reserved mineral interests and that Southwest breached its duty to lease the minerals to
third parties for development. The court further ruled that Southwest was the sole holder of the
right to lease the minerals to third parties. The order granting the plaintiffs&#146; motion was
severed into Cause No.&nbsp;28769, styled <U>Betty Yvon Lesley et a1. v. Bluff Dale Development
Corporation, Bluegreen Southwest One. L.P. et al.</U> in the 266th Judicial District Court, Erath
County, Texas. Southwest appealed the trial court&#146;s ruling. On January&nbsp;22, 2009, in <U>Bluegreen
Southwest One, L.P. et al. v. Betty Yvon Lesley et al.</U>, in the 11th Court of Appeals, Eastland,
Texas, the Appellate Court reversed the trial court&#146;s decision and ruled in Southwest&#146;s favor and
determined that all executive rights were owned by Southwest and then transferred to the individual
property owners in connection with the sales of land. All property owner claims were decided in
favor of Southwest. It was also decided that Southwest did not breach a fiduciary duty to the
plaintiffs as an executive rights holder. On May&nbsp;14, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the
Texas Supreme Court asking the Court to reverse the Appellate Court&#146;s decision in favor of
Southwest. On September&nbsp;15, 2010 the Court heard oral arguments on whether to reverse or affirm the
Appellate Court&#146;s decision. No information is available as to when the Texas Supreme Court will
render a decision on the appeal.

misrepresentation, breach of contract, and negligence with regards to the Ridgelake Shores
subdivision, developed in Montgomery County, Texas, specifically, the usability of the lakes
within the community for fishing and sporting and the general level of quality at the community.
The lawsuit sought material damages and the payment of costs to remediate the lake. On September
10, 2010, a tentative settlement of this matter was reached, pursuant to which Bluegreen agreed to
pay $0.3&nbsp;million to provide for improvements to the fish habitat and general usability of the lake
environment. The settlement agreement has since been fully executed and as of December&nbsp;31, 2010
Bluegreen has paid $0.2&nbsp;million of the agreed upon settlement payment. Bluegreen has accrued the

alleging breach by Bluegreen Communities of Georgia and the community association of a bulk cable
TV services contract at Bluegreen&#146;s Sanctuary Cove single family residential community being
developed in Waverly, Georgia. In its complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that approximately $0.2
million in unpaid bulk cable fees are due from the defendants, and that the non-payment of fees
will continue to accrue on a monthly basis. Bluegreen and the community association allege
incomplete performance under the contract by the plaintiffs and that the cable system installed was

authorizes the repurchase of up to 20,000,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock at an
aggregate cost of no more than $10&nbsp;million. This program replaces the $10&nbsp;million repurchase
program that BFC&#146;s Board of Directors approved in October&nbsp;2006 which placed a limitation on the
number of shares which could be repurchased under the program at 1,750,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock. In 2008, BFC repurchased 100,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock at an aggregate cost of
$54,000 under the prior program. The current program, like the prior program, authorizes
management, at its discretion, to repurchase shares from time to time subject to market conditions
and other factors. No shares were repurchased for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 or 2009.

with and into the Company during November&nbsp;2007, the 4,764,285 shares of the
Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and 500,000 shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock that were owned by I.R.E. RAG were considered outstanding.
However, because the Company owned 45.5% of the outstanding common stock of
I.R.E. RAG, 2,165,367 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and 227,250 shares of
Class&nbsp;B Common Stock were eliminated from the number of shares outstanding
for purposes of computing earnings per share.</TD>

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC Financial Corporation (&#147;BFC&#148; or, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise
requires, &#147;we&#148;, &#147;us&#148;, &#147;our&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a diversified holding company whose principal
holdings include a controlling interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries,
including BankAtlantic (&#147;BankAtlantic Bancorp&#148;), a controlling interest in Bluegreen Corporation
and its subsidiaries (&#147;Bluegreen&#148;), and a non-controlling interest in Benihana, Inc. (&#147;Benihana&#148;).
As a result of its position as the controlling shareholder of BankAtlantic Bancorp, BFC is a
&#147;unitary savings bank holding company&#148; regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, BFC and its subsidiaries had total consolidated assets and
liabilities of approximately $5.8&nbsp;billion and $5.6&nbsp;billion, respectively and total equity of
approximately $221.1&nbsp;million, including noncontrolling interests equity of approximately $78.3
million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, BFC&#146;s business strategy has been to invest in and acquire businesses in diverse
industries either directly or through controlled subsidiaries. However, BFC believes that, in the
short term, the Company&#146;s and its shareholders&#146; interests are best served by BFC providing
strategic support to its existing investments. In furtherance of this strategy, the Company took
several steps in 2009 and 2010, including those described below, which it believes will enhance the
Company&#146;s prospects. During the third quarter of 2009, BFC and Woodbridge Holdings Corporation
consummated their merger pursuant to which Woodbridge became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC.
During the fourth quarter of 2009, our ownership interest in Bluegreen increased to 52% as a result
of the purchase of an additional 23% interest in Bluegreen. We have also increased our investment
in BankAtlantic Bancorp through our participation in BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s rights offerings to its
shareholders during the third quarter of 2009 and the second quarter of 2010, which in the
aggregate increased our economic interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp to 45% and our voting interest in
BankAtlantic Bancorp to 71%. In the future, we will consider other opportunities that could alter
our ownership in our affiliates or seek to make opportunistic investments outside of our existing
portfolio; however, we do not currently have pre-determined parameters as to the industry or
structure of any future investment. In furtherance of our goals, we will continue to evaluate
various financing transactions that may present themselves, including raising additional debt or
equity as well as other alternative sources of new capital.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During July&nbsp;2010, Benihana announced its intention to engage in a formal review of strategic
alternatives, including a possible sale of the company. During March&nbsp;2011, Bluegreen announced its
intention to evaluate strategic alternatives for the Bluegreen Communities division, including a
possible sale of Bluegreen Communities. Each company has engaged advisors to assist it in pursuing
strategic alternatives. BFC is supportive of Benihana and Bluegreen in achieving their objectives.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, we consummated our merger with Woodbridge Holdings Corporation pursuant
to which Woodbridge Holdings Corporation merged with and into Woodbridge Holdings, LLC,
&#147;Woodbridge&#148; which continued as the surviving company of the merger and the successor entity to
Woodbridge Holdings Corporation. Pursuant to the terms of the merger, which was approved by each
company&#146;s shareholders at their respective meetings held on September&nbsp;21, 2009, each outstanding
share of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock automatically converted into the right to receive 3.47
shares of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. Shares otherwise issuable to us attributable to the shares of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock owned by us were canceled in connection
with the merger. As a result of the merger, Woodbridge Holdings Corporation&#146;s separate corporate
existence ceased and its Class&nbsp;A Common Stock is no longer publicly traded. See Note 3 of the
&#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for additional information about the merger.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;16, 2009, we purchased approximately 7.4&nbsp;million additional shares of Bluegreen&#146;s
common stock, which increased our ownership in Bluegreen from 9.5&nbsp;million shares, or 29%, to 16.9
million shares, or 52%, of Bluegreen&#146;s outstanding stock. As a result of the purchase, we hold a
controlling interest in Bluegreen and, since November&nbsp;16, 2009, we have consolidated Bluegreen&#146;s
results into our financial statements. Any reference to Bluegreen&#146;s results of operations for 2009
includes only 45&nbsp;days of activity for Bluegreen relating to the period from November&nbsp;16, 2009, the
date of the share purchase, through December&nbsp;31, 2009 (the &#147;Bluegreen Interim Period&#148;). Prior to
November&nbsp;16, 2009, our approximate 29% equity investment in Bluegreen was accounted for under the
equity method. See Note 4 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for additional
information about the Bluegreen share acquisition on November&nbsp;16, 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to our merger with Woodbridge and our acquisition of additional shares of
Bluegreen&#146;s common stock, we also increased our investment in BankAtlantic Bancorp during 2009 and
2010 through our participation in shareholder rights offerings engaged in by BankAtlantic Bancorp
during the years. Specifically, we exercised subscription rights in BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s rights
offerings to purchase an aggregate of 14.9&nbsp;million shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock during the third quarter of 2009 and 10.0&nbsp;million shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock during June and July&nbsp;2010. In the aggregate, these purchases increased our ownership
interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp from approximately 30% to 45% and our voting interest in
BankAtlantic Bancorp from approximately 59% to 71%.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a holding company with controlling positions in BankAtlantic Bancorp and Bluegreen,
generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) requires the consolidation of the financial
results of both entities. As a consequence, the assets and liabilities of both entities are
presented on a consolidated basis in BFC&#146;s financial statements. However, except as otherwise
noted, the debts and obligations of the consolidated entities, including Woodbridge, are not direct
obligations of BFC and are non-recourse to BFC. Similarly, the assets of those entities are not
available to BFC absent a dividend or distribution. The recognition by BFC of income from
controlled entities is determined based on the total percent of economic ownership in those
entities. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, we owned approximately 52% of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock and had an
approximately 45% ownership interest and 71% voting interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2010, the following developments had significant financial impact:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Deconsolidation of Certain Subsidiaries of Core &#151;</I></B>In early 2010, Woodbridge made the decision
to pursue an orderly liquidation of Core and worked cooperatively with its lenders to achieve that
objective. During November&nbsp;2010, Core entered into a settlement agreement with one of its lenders,
which had previously commenced actions seeking foreclosure of mortgage loans totaling approximately
$113.9&nbsp;million collateralized by property in Florida and South Carolina. Under the terms of the
agreement, Core pledged additional collateral to the lender consisting of membership interests in
five of Core&#146;s subsidiaries and granted security interests in the acreage owned by such
subsidiaries in Port St. Lucie, Florida, substantially all of which is undeveloped raw land. Core
also agreed to an amendment of the complaint related to the Florida foreclosure action to include
this additional collateral and an entry into consensual judgments of foreclosure in both the
Florida and South Carolina foreclosure actions. In consideration therefor, the lender agreed not to
enforce a deficiency judgment against Core and, during February&nbsp;2011, released Core from any other
claims arising from or relating to the loans. As of November&nbsp;30, 2010, Core deconsolidated the five
subsidiaries, the membership interests in which were transferred to the lender upon entry into the
consensual judgments of foreclosure. In connection therewith and in accordance with accounting
guidance for consolidation, Woodbridge recorded a guarantee
obligation &#147;deferred gain on settlement of
investment in subsidiary&#148; of $11.3&nbsp;million in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Financial
Condition as of December&nbsp;31, 2010. The deferred gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary was
recognized into income in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations at the time Core
received its general release of liability in February&nbsp;2011.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2010, Core and one of its subsidiaries entered agreements, including, without
limitation, a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure Agreement, with one of their lenders which resolved the
foreclosure proceedings commenced by the lender related to property at Tradition Hilton Head which
served as collateral for a $25&nbsp;million loan. Pursuant to the agreements, Core&#146;s subsidiary
transferred to the lender all of its right, title and interest in and to the property which served
as collateral for the loan as well as certain additional real and personal property. In
consideration therefore, the lender released Core and its subsidiary from any claims arising from
or relating to the loan. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, this transaction was
accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring and, accordingly, a $13.0&nbsp;million gain on debt
extinguishment was recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revisions to Consolidated Financial Statements &#151; </I></B>The allocation of the Bluegreen purchase price was
based on preliminary estimates of the fair value of Bluegreen&#146;s inventory and contracts, and is
subject to change within the measurement period as valuations are finalized. If the amounts are
changed within the measurement period in a business combination, then the adjustment to change
these provisional amounts are retrospectively adjusted as of the date of acquisition. Additionally,
any offset relating to amortization/accretion is also retrospectively adjusted in the appropriate
periods. The company finalized the valuations in the fourth quarter of 2010. These adjustments
resulted in a decrease in total assets and total liabilities of approximately $3.4&nbsp;million and $3.0
million, respectively, and a decrease in total equity of approximately $0.4&nbsp;million. Furthermore,
the net income attributable to BFC decreased by approximately $289,000 and earnings per share from
continuing operations decreased by approximately $0.01 per common share. For

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, during the fourth quarter, management identified certain errors in its
previously reported financial statements for 2010 and 2009. Because these errors are not material
to the Company&#146;s financial statements for 2010 or 2009, individually or in the aggregate, the
Company corrected these errors as revisions to its quarterly financial statements in 2010 and its
December&nbsp;31, 2009 financial statements. These adjustments include entries to correct errors in the
following areas: the recognition of interest income associated with the acquired notes receivable
in accordance with the accounting guidance <I>Loans and Debt Securities with Deteriorated Credit
Quality</I>; an adjustment to the provision for loan losses for the acquired notes receivable;
interest expense recognition for notes payable of certain defaulted debt at Core Communities and
Carolina Oak at the defaulted interest rate, where the stated interest rate was previously used;
the recognition of income tax benefits associated with unrealized gains in accumulated other
comprehensive income; and an adjustment to deferred taxes to correct an impairment to real estate
inventory which was reflected post the acquisition date and accounted for as a temporary
difference, which should have been included in the determination of deferred taxes at the
acquisition date, November&nbsp;16, 2009, as part of the Bluegreen purchase price allocation.
</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010, was an increase to sales of real estate
of $10.2&nbsp;million, net of allowance, a decrease to interest income of $5.8&nbsp;million, an increase to
interest expense of $1.3&nbsp;million, and a decrease in income tax benefit of $653,000. The impact for
the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010, was an increase to sales of real estate of $12.3&nbsp;million, net
of allowance, a decrease to interest income of $6.5&nbsp;million, an increase to interest expense of
$1.3&nbsp;million, and an increase in income tax provision of $2.2&nbsp;million. The impact for the three

million, and an increase in income tax benefit of $1.8&nbsp;million. For further discussion on such
adjustments, see Note 40 &#151; <I>Selected Quarterly Results (Unaudited). </I>The Company will correct these
amounts in future filings when it discloses them as comparable periods.

$2.0&nbsp;million of income, an $11.9&nbsp;million loss and $19.4&nbsp;million of income, respectively, related
to discontinued operations, which were associated with Ryan Beck and Core Communities commercial
leasing projects, as discussed further in Note 6 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total assets at December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 were $5.8&nbsp;billion and $6.0&nbsp;billion, respectively.
The changes in components of total assets between December&nbsp;31, 2009 and December&nbsp;31, 2010 are
summarized below. On January&nbsp;1, 2010, BFC, Bluegreen and BankAtlantic Bancorp adopted an amendment
to the accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets and an amendment to the accounting
guidance associated with the consolidation of VIEs. As a result of the adoption of these accounting
standards, Bluegreen consolidated seven existing special purpose finance entities associated with
prior securitization transactions that previously qualified for off-balance sheet sales treatment,
and BankAtlantic Bancorp consolidated its joint venture that conducts a factoring business.
Accordingly, Bluegreen&#146;s consolidated special purpose finance entities and BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
consolidated factoring joint venture are now consolidated in BFC&#146;s financial statements. The
consolidation of Bluegreen&#146;s special purpose finance entities resulted in a one-time non-cash
after-tax reduction to retained earnings of $2.4&nbsp;million and the following impacts to the Company&#146;s
Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at January&nbsp;1, 2010: (1)&nbsp;assets increased by $413.8
million, primarily representing the consolidation of notes receivable, net of allowance, partially
offset by the elimination of Bluegreen&#146;s retained interests; (2)&nbsp;liabilities increased by $416.7
million, primarily representing the consolidation of non-recourse debt obligations associated with
third parties, partially offset by the elimination of certain deferred tax liabilities; and (3)
total equity decreased by approximately $2.9&nbsp;million, including a decrease of approximately $1.5
million to noncontrolling interests (see Note 5 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148;
for further information). The consolidation of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s factoring joint venture did
not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements other than a decrease in investments
in unconsolidated affiliates. Other than such increases and decreases, the changes in components of
total assets from December&nbsp;31, 2009 to December&nbsp;31, 2010 were primarily comprised of:

Company&#146;s preferred stock as 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock (&#147;5% Preferred Stock&#148;). On June&nbsp;21,
2004, the Company sold all 15,000 shares of the 5% Preferred Stock to an investor group in a
private offering.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5% Preferred Stock has a stated value of $1,000 per share. The shares of 5% Preferred
Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Company, from time to time, at redemption prices (the
&#147;Redemption Price&#148;) ranging from $1,025 per share during 2011 to $1,000 per share during and after
2015. The 5% Preferred Stock liquidation preference is equal to its stated value of $1,000 per
share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends or an amount equal to the Redemption Price in a
voluntary liquidation or winding up of the Company. Holders of the 5% Preferred Stock are entitled
to receive, when and as declared by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors, cumulative quarterly cash
dividends on each such share at a rate per annum of 5% of the stated value from the date of
issuance, payable quarterly. Since June&nbsp;2004, the Company has paid quarterly dividends on the 5%
Preferred Stock of $187,500. The 5% Preferred Stock has no voting rights except as required by
Florida law.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;17, 2008, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation (the &#147;Amendment&#148;) to
change certain of the previously designated relative rights, preferences and limitations of the
Company&#146;s 5% Preferred Stock. The Amendment eliminated the right of the holders of the 5% Preferred
Stock to convert their shares of 5% Preferred Stock into shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock. The Amendment also requires the Company to redeem shares of the 5% Preferred Stock with the
net proceeds it receives in the event (i)&nbsp;the Company sells any of its shares of Benihana Series&nbsp;B
Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#147;Convertible Preferred Stock&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;the Company sells any shares
of Benihana&#146;s common stock received upon conversion of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock or
(iii)&nbsp;Benihana redeems any shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock owned by the Company.
Additionally, in the event the Company defaults on its obligation to make dividend payments on the
5% Preferred Stock, the Amendment entitles the holders of BFC&#146;s 5% Preferred Stock to receive
directly from Benihana certain payments on the shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock
owned by the Company or on the shares of Benihana&#146;s common stock received by the Company upon
conversion of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2008, based on an analysis of the 5% Preferred Stock after giving effect to the
Amendment, the Company determined that the 5% Preferred Stock met the requirements to be
re-classified outside of permanent equity at its fair value at the effective date of the Amendment
of approximately $11.0&nbsp;million into the mezzanine category as Redeemable 5% Cumulative Preferred
Stock. The remaining amount of approximately $4.0&nbsp;million continues to be

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management views critical accounting policies as accounting policies that are important
to the understanding of our financial statements and also involve estimates and judgments about
inherently uncertain matters. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial
condition and assumptions that affect the recognition of income and expenses on the consolidated
statement of operations for the periods presented. Actual results could differ significantly from
those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in
subsequent periods relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of
real estate acquired in connection with foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans, the valuation of
the fair value of assets and liabilities in the application of the acquisition method of
accounting, evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, the valuation of
real estate and its impairment reserves, revenue and cost recognition on percent complete projects,
estimated costs to complete construction, the valuation of investments in unconsolidated
subsidiaries, accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowance, accounting for uncertain tax
positions, accounting for contingencies, and assumptions used in the valuation of stock based
compensation. The accounting policies that we have identified as critical accounting policies are:
(i)&nbsp;allowance for loan losses and notes receivable; (ii)&nbsp;the valuation of retained interests in
notes receivable sold and the related gains on sales of notes receivable; (iii)&nbsp;Bluegreen acquired
notes receivable; (iv)&nbsp;impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets; (v)&nbsp;valuation of securities
as well as the determination of other-than-temporary declines in value; (vi)&nbsp;accounting for
business combinations; (vii)&nbsp;the valuation of real estate; (viii)&nbsp;revenue and cost recognition on
percent complete projects; (ix)&nbsp;estimated cost to complete construction; (x)&nbsp;accounting for
deferred tax asset valuation allowance; and (xi)&nbsp;accounting for contingencies . See also Note 1,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148;
included in Item&nbsp;8 of this report for a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Business Combinations</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB revised its authoritative guidance for business combinations which
significantly changed the accounting for business combinations. Under this guidance, subject to
limited exceptions, an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value. Additionally, due
diligence and transaction costs incurred to effect a business combination are expensed as incurred,
as opposed to being capitalized as part of the acquisition purchase price. This guidance also
includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements. The Company adopted this guidance on
January&nbsp;1, 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for its acquisitions in accordance with the accounting guidance for
business combinations. If the Company makes a &#147;bargain purchase&#148;, the Company recognizes a gain in
the income statement on the acquisition date. A bargain purchase is a business combination in which
the amounts of the identifiable net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, as measured on the
acquisition date in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations, exceeds the
aggregate of (i)&nbsp;the consideration transferred, as measured in accordance with the accounting
guidance, which generally requires acquisition date fair value; (ii)&nbsp;the fair value of any
non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and (iii)&nbsp;in a business combination achieved in stages,
the acquisition date fair value of the Company&#146;s previously held equity interest in the acquiree.
This allocation process requires extensive use of estimates

parties to assist the Company in assessing market conditions when appropriate. The Company
is also required to periodically review these judgments and estimates and adjust them
accordingly. If conditions change from those expected, it is possible that the results could change
in future periods. Certain identifiable intangible assets, such as management contracts, are not
amortized, but instead are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis, or if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The
Company accounted for the acquisition of a controlling interest in Bluegreen in November&nbsp;2009 as a
bargain purchase. Accordingly, judgments regarding the value of Bluegreen&#146;s assets and liabilities
as of the acquisition date have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on the
Company&#146;s operating results.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounted for the acquisition of a controlling interest in Bluegreen in November
2009 in accordance with the accounting guidance of business combinations. As part of the accounting
for the November&nbsp;2009 Bluegreen share acquisition, management was required to evaluate the fair
value of Bluegreen&#146;s inventory and certain of Bluegreen&#146;s contracts. Based on preliminary estimates
made as part of the evaluation, the Company recorded a $183.1&nbsp;million &#147;bargain purchase gain&#148;
during the fourth quarter of 2009. However, as previously disclosed, the allocation of the purchase
price was based on preliminary estimates of the fair value of Bluegreen&#146;s inventory and contracts,
and is subject to change within the measurement period as valuations are finalized. If the amounts
are changed within the measurement period in a business combination, then the adjustment to change
these provisional amounts are retrospectively adjusted as of the date of acquisition. Additionally,
any offset relating to amortization/accretion is also retrospectively adjusted in the appropriate
periods. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company adjusted the preliminary value assigned to
the assets and liabilities of Bluegreen in order to reflect additional information obtained since
the acquisition date. These adjustments resulted in a decrease in total assets and total
liabilities of approximately $3.4&nbsp;million and $3.0&nbsp;million,
respectively, and a decrease in total
equity of approximately $0.4&nbsp;million. Furthermore, the net income attributable to BFC decreased by
approximately $289,000 and earnings per share from continuing operations decreased by approximately
$0.01 per common share.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are required to disclose the fair value of our investments under accounting guidance for
fair value measurements. Based on this accounting guidance, fair value is the price that would be
received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). As such, fair value is a
market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, this
accounting guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair
value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by
requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. The three-tier fair value
hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining fair value, we are sometimes required to use various valuation techniques. When
valuation techniques other than those described as Level 1 are utilized, management must make
estimates and judgments in determining the fair value for its investments. The degree to which
management&#146;s estimates and judgments is required is generally dependent upon the market pricing
available for the investments, the availability of observable inputs, the frequency of trading in
the investments and the investment&#146;s complexity. If we make different judgments regarding
unobservable inputs, we could potentially reach different conclusions regarding the fair value of
our investments.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We evaluate our intangible assets when events and circumstances indicate that assets may be
impaired and when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less
than their carrying amounts. The carrying value of these assets is dependent upon estimates of
future earnings that they are expected to generate. If cash flows decrease significantly,
intangible assets may be impaired and would be written down to their fair value. The estimates of
useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future
periods that are subject to outside factors.

2010, which were originated in connection with the November&nbsp;16, 2009 acquisition of a controlling
interest in Bluegreen. Such management contracts are not amortized, but instead are reviewed for
impairment at least annually, or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related
carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, other intangible assets also consist of core deposit intangible
assets of approximately $12.7&nbsp;million and $16.2&nbsp;million, respectively, which were initially
recorded at fair value and then amortized over the average life of the respective assets, ranging
from 7&nbsp;years to 10&nbsp;years.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s revenue and all related costs and expenses from house and land sales are
recognized at the time that closing has occurred, when title and possession of the property and the
risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the buyer, and when the Company does not have a
substantial continuing involvement in accordance with the accounting guidance for sales of real
estate. In order to properly match revenues with expenses, the Company estimates construction and
land development costs incurred and to be incurred, but not paid at the time of closing. Estimated
costs to complete are determined for each closed home and land sale based upon historical data with
respect to similar product types and geographical areas and allocated to closings along with actual
costs incurred based on a relative sales value approach. To the extent the estimated costs to
complete have significantly changed, the Company will adjust cost of sales in the current period
for the impact on cost of sales of previously sold homes and land to ensure a consistent margin of
sales is maintained.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue is recognized for certain land sales on the percentage-of-completion method when the
land sale takes place prior to all contracted work being completed. Pursuant to the requirements
of the accounting guidance for sales of real estate, if the seller has some continuing involvement
with the property and does not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership,
profit shall be recognized by a method determined by the nature and extent of the seller&#146;s
continuing involvement. In the case of land sales, this involvement typically consists of final
development activities. The Company recognizes revenue and related costs as work progresses using
the percentage of completion method, which relies on estimates of total expected costs to complete
required work. Revenue is recognized in proportion to the percentage of total costs incurred in
relation to estimated total costs at the time of sale. Actual revenues and costs to complete
construction in the future could differ from current estimates. If the estimates of development
costs remaining to be completed are significantly different from actual amounts, then the revenues,
related cumulative profits and costs of sales may be revised in the period that estimates change.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;)
Accounting Codification Standards (&#147;ACS&#148;) 970-605, <I>Real Estate-Revenue Recognition</I>, Bluegreen
recognizes revenue on VOI and homesite sales when a minimum of 10% of the sales price has been
received in cash (buyer&#146;s commitment), the legal rescission period has expired, collectibility of
the receivable representing the remainder of the sales price is reasonably assured and it has
completed substantially all of its obligations with respect to any development related to the real
estate sold. Bluegreen believes its methodology to estimate the collectibility of the receivables
representing the remainder of the sales price of real estate sold is reasonably reliable. See the
further discussion of Bluegreen&#146;s policies regarding the estimation of credit losses on notes
receivable below. Should Bluegreen become unable to reasonably estimate the collectibility of
receivables, it may have to defer the recognition of sales and its results of operations could be
negatively impacted. Under timeshare accounting rules, the buyer&#146;s minimum cash down payment
towards the purchase of VOIs is met only if the cash down payment received, reduced by the value of
certain incentives provided to the buyer at the time of sale, is at least 10% of the sales price.
If, after consideration of the value of the incentive, the total down payment received from the
buyer is less than 10% of the sales price, the VOI sale, and the related cost of sales and direct
selling expenses, are deferred until such time that sufficient cash is received from the customer,

Bluegreen provides to buyers of VOIs may result in additional VOI sales being deferred, which could
materially adversely impact Bluegreen&#146;s results of operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where all development has not been substantially completed, Bluegreen recognizes
revenue in accordance with the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Should Bluegreen&#146;s
estimates of the total anticipated cost of completing Bluegreen Resorts&#146; or Bluegreen Communities&#146;
projects increase, Bluegreen may be required to defer a greater amount of revenue or may be
required to defer revenue for a longer period of time, which could materially adversely impact its
results of operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timeshare accounting rules require the use of the relative sales value method for
relieving VOI inventory and recording cost of sales. Under the relative sales value method, cost
of sales is calculated as a percentage of net sales using a cost-of-sales percentage&#151;the ratio of
total estimated development cost to total estimated VOI revenue, including the estimated
incremental revenue from the resale of repossessed VOI inventory, generally as a result of the
default of the related receivable. For Communities&#146; real estate projects, costs are allocated to
individual homesites in the Communities&#146; projects based on the relative estimated sales value of
each homesite without regard to defaults or repossessed inventory. Under this method, the
allocated cost of a homesite is relieved from inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon
recognition of the related sale. Should Bluegreen&#146;s estimates of the sales values of its VOI and
homesite inventories differ materially from their ultimate selling prices, Bluegreen&#146;s gross profit
could be adversely impacted.

assets including a pool of notes receivable consisting principally of homogenous consumer timeshare
loans originated by Bluegreen. Consistent with the accounting guidance, the Company has elected an
accounting policy based on expected cash flows including, following the guidance on maintaining the
integrity of a pool of multiple loans accounted for as a single asset. The loans have common risk
characteristics as defined in the accounting guidance <I>Loans and Debt Securities with Deteriorated
Credit Quality, </I>including similar risk ratings, as defined and monitored by risk rating agencies,
term, purpose and similar collateral type (Vacation Ownership Interests (&#147;VOI&#146;s&#148;)). The Company
evaluates the pool of loans accounted for as a single asset for indications of further impairment.
Purchased loans are considered to be impaired if the Company does not expect to receive all
contractually required cash flows due to concerns about credit quality. The excess of the cash
flows expected to be collected measured as of the acquisition date, over the estimated fair value
is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized into interest income over the remaining
life of the loan using a level yield methodology. The difference between contractually required
payments as of the acquisition date and the cash flows expected to be collected is referred to as
the nonaccretable difference.

previously recorded allowance for loan losses, to the extent applicable, and a reclassification
from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield for any remaining increase. Changes in expected
interest cash flows may result in reclassifications to/from the nonaccretable difference. Loan
disposals, which may include receipt of payments in full from the borrower or foreclosure, result

in the notes receivable sold. Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2009-17,
these retained interests were reported as assets and treated as available-for-sale investments and,
accordingly, carried at fair value. Changes in the fair values of the retained interests in notes

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount that BankAtlantic Bancorp believes
to be a reasonable estimate of probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio. BankAtlantic
Bancorp has developed policies and procedures for evaluating its allowance for loan losses which
considers all information available to BankAtlantic Bancorp. However, BankAtlantic Bancorp relies
on estimates and judgments regarding issues where the outcome is unknown. As a consequence, if
circumstances differ and the amount of losses actually realized in BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s loan
portfolio could be significantly higher or lower from its estimates and judgments, the allowance
for loan losses may decrease or increase significantly.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calculation of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s allowance for loan losses consists of two
components. The first component requires identifying impaired loans based on BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s management classification and, if necessary, assigning a valuation allowance to the
impaired loans. Valuation allowances are established using

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s management estimates of the fair value of collateral or based on valuation models that present
value estimated expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate.
These valuations are based on available information and require estimates and subjective judgments
about fair values of the collateral or expected future cash flows. Most of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
loans do not have an observable market price, and an estimate of the collection of contractual
cash flows is based on the judgment of management. It is likely that materially different results
would be obtained if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. As a consequence of the
estimates and assumptions required to calculate the first component of the allowance for loan
losses, a change in these highly uncertain estimates could have a materially favorable or
unfavorable impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second component of the allowance for loan losses requires BankAtlantic Bancorp to group
loans that have similar credit risk characteristics so as to form a basis for estimating probable
losses inherent in the group of loans based on historical loss percentages and delinquency trends
as it relates to the group. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s management assigns a quantitative allowance to
these groups of loans by utilizing historical loss experiences. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s management
uses its judgment to determine the length of the time used in the historical loss experience.
During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, management used a 2&nbsp;year loss experience to calculate the
loss experience. However, due to the rapid decline in economic conditions and real estate values,
during 2009, management shortened its historical loss experience by portfolio to between six
months and one year, in order to reflect the current heighted loss experience in the quantitative
allowance. The shortened historical loss experience assumption remained throughout 2010. The
historical loss period is selected based on management&#146;s judgment and a change in this loss period
may result in material changes to the quantitative loss allowance. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
management also assigns a qualitative allowance to these groups of loans in order to adjust the
historical data, if necessary, for qualitative factors that exist currently that were not present
in the historical data. These qualitative factors include delinquency trends, actual loan
classification migration trends, economic and business conditions, concentration of credit risk,
loan-to-value ratios, non-performing loan trends and external factors. In deriving the
qualitative allowance BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s management uses significant judgment to qualitatively
adjust the historical loss experiences for current trends that existed at period end that were not
reflected in the calculated historical loss ratios and to adjust the allowance for the changes in
the current economic climate compared to the economic environment that existed historically. A
subsequent change in data trends or the external environment may result in material changes in
this component of the allowance from period to period.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management believes that the allowance for loan losses reflects a reasonable estimate of
incurred credit losses as of the statement of financial condition date. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010,
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s allowance for loan losses was $162.1&nbsp;million. See &#147;Provision for Loan
Losses&#148; for a discussion of the amounts of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s allowance assigned to each loan
product. The estimated allowance, which was derived from the above methodology, may be
significantly different from actual realized losses. Actual losses incurred in the future are
highly dependent upon future events, including the economies of geographic areas in which
BankAtlantic Bancorp holds loans, especially in Florida. These factors are beyond management&#146;s
control. Accordingly, BankAtlantic Bancorp may incur credit losses in excess of the amounts
estimated by its allowance for loan losses. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an
integral part of their examination process, periodically review its allowance for loan losses.
Such agencies may require BankAtlantic Bancorp to recognize additions to the allowance based on
its judgments and information available to them at the time of their examination and such
judgments may differ from management&#146;s judgment.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp analyzes its loan portfolio quarterly by monitoring the loan mix, credit
quality, loan-to-value ratios, concentration by geographical area, vintage, historical trends and
economic conditions. As a consequence, the allowance for loan losses estimates will change from
period to period. During the three year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, real estate markets
experienced significant price increases accompanied by an abundance of available mortgage
financing. Additionally, based on historical loss experience during that time, BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s credit policies focused its loan production on collateral based loans and the
discontinuation of certain loan products. These factors, other internal metrics and external
market factors favorably impacted their provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses
during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. Conversely, during the four years ended December&nbsp;31,
2010, the real estate market (and particularly the residential real estate market) and general
economic conditions, both nationally and in Florida, rapidly deteriorated with significant
reductions in the market prices and volume of residential real estate sold, plummeting collateral
values, dramatic increases in unemployment and severe tightening of credit availability to
borrowers. The impact of these rapidly deteriorating real estate market conditions and adverse
economic conditions on our loan portfolios resulted in a significant increase in the ratio of
allowance for loan losses to total loans from 0.94% at December&nbsp;31, 2006 to 5.08% at December&nbsp;31,
2010. We believe that our performance in subsequent periods will be highly sensitive to changes
in the Florida real estate market as well

approach valuation techniques and a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in
valuation techniques. Our policy is to use quoted market prices (Level 1 inputs) when available.
However quoted market prices are not available for BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s mortgage-backed
securities, REMIC&#146;s, other securities and certain equity securities, which therefore requires the
use of Level 2 or Level 3 inputs. The classification of assumptions as Level 2 or Level 3 inputs
is based on judgments and the classification of the inputs could change based on the availability
of observable market data.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp subscribes to a third-party service to assist it in determining the fair
value of mortgage-backed securities and real estate mortgage conduits. The estimated fair value
of these securities at December&nbsp;31, 2010 was $241.0&nbsp;million. Matrix pricing are used to value
these securities as identical securities that are not traded on active markets. Matrix pricing
computes the fair value of mortgage-backed securities and real estate mortgage conduits based on
the coupon rate, maturity date and estimates of future repayment rates obtained from trades of
securities with similar characteristics and from market data obtained from brokers. BankAtlantic
Bancorp considers the above inputs Level 2. Upon the sale of securities, BankAtlantic Bancorp
back-tests the values obtained from matrix pricing for reasonableness. The valuations obtained
from matrix pricing are not actual transactions and may not reflect the actual amount that would
be realized upon sale. While the interest rate and prepayment assumptions used in matrix pricing
are representative of assumptions that BankAtlantic Bancorp believes market participants would use
in valuing these securities, different assumptions may result in significantly different results.
Additionally, current observable data may not be available in subsequent periods which would cause
BankAtlantic Bancorp to utilize Level 3 inputs to value these securities. The mortgage-backed and
REMIC securities that BankAtlantic owns are government agency guaranteed with minimal credit risk.
These securities are of high credit quality and BankAtlantic believes could be liquidated in the
near future; however, the price obtained upon sale could be higher or lower than the fair value
obtained through matrix pricing. In light of the current volatility and uncertainty in credit
markets, it is difficult to estimate with accuracy the price that could be obtained for these
securities and the time that it could take to sell them in an orderly transaction.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We perform an evaluation on a quarterly basis to determine if any of our equity investments
and debt securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. In making this determination, we consider
the extent and duration of the impairment, the nature and financial condition of the issuer and our
ability and intent to hold securities for a period sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery
in market value. If an equity security is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we
record an impairment loss as a charge to income for the period in which the impairment loss is
determined to exist, resulting in a reduction to our earnings for that period. If a debt security
is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we record an impairment loss as a charge to
income if we intend to sell the securities before they recover or if we do not expect to recover
the securities historical cost due to credit loss. Management exercises significant judgment in
estimating the amount of specific valuation allowances in an impairment which is generally based on
the present value of expected cash flows. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic Bancorp had $105.6
million of impaired securities with an unrealized loss of $48,000. There is no assurance that we
will not determine that we have additional impaired securities in the future, particularly as a
result of current market uncertainties and the challenging economic and credit market conditions.

BankAtlantic Bancorp to determine the fair value of its reporting units and compare the reporting
units&#146; fair value to its carrying value. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s reporting units are comprised of
Community Banking, Commercial Lending, Tax Certificate Operations, Capital Services and Investment
Operations. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using discounted cash flow
present value valuation models and market multiple techniques.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While management of BankAtlantic Bancorp believes the sources utilized to arrive at the fair
value estimates are reliable, different sources or methods could have yielded different fair value
estimates. These fair value estimates require a significant amount of judgment. If the fair value
of a reporting unit is below the carrying amount, a second step of the goodwill impairment test is
performed. This second step requires BankAtlantic Bancorp to determine the fair value of all
assets (recognized and unrecognized) and liabilities in a manner similar to a business combination
purchase price allocation. Since there is no active market for many of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
assets, management derives the fair value of the majority of these assets using net present value
models. As a consequence, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s management estimates rely on assumptions and
judgments regarding issues where the outcome is unknown and, as a result, actual results or values
may differ significantly from these estimates. Additionally, declines in the market capitalization
of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s common stock affect the aggregate fair value of the reporting units.
Changes in management&#146;s valuation of BankAtlantic Bancorp reporting units and the underlying assets
as well as declines in BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s market capitalization may affect future earnings

step acquisition of approximately $0.6&nbsp;million) and $48.3&nbsp;million, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31,
2010, the remaining goodwill was $12.2&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the fair value of the reporting units, BankAtlantic Bancorp used a combination
of discounted cash flow techniques and market multiple methodologies. These methods utilize
assumptions for expected cash flows, discount rates, and comparable financial institutions to
determine market multiples. The aggregate fair value of all reporting units derived from the above
valuation techniques was compared to BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s market capitalization adjusted for a
control premium in order to determine the reasonableness of the financial model output. A control
premium represents the value an investor would pay above minority interest transaction prices in
order to obtain a controlling interest in the subject company. The values separately derived from
each valuation technique (i.e., discounted cash flow and market multiples) were used to develop an
overall estimate of a reporting unit&#146;s fair value. Different weighting of the various fair value
techniques could result in a higher or lower fair value. Judgment is applied in determining the
weightings that are most representative of fair value. BankAtlantic Bancorp used financial
projections over a period of time, considered necessary to achieve a steady state of cash flows for
each reporting unit. The primary assumptions in the projections were anticipated loan and deposit
growth, interest rates and revenue growth. The discount rates were estimated based on the Capital
Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and
unsystematic risk and size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The
estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in the discount rate and
terminal value assumptions. Minor changes in these assumptions could impact significantly the fair
value assigned to a reporting unit. Future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the
estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value, goodwill may be
impaired, and the second step of the goodwill impairment evaluation is performed. The second step
involves calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill. The implied fair
value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as it is determined in a business combination.
The fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s assets and liabilities, including previously unrecognized
intangible assets, is individually determined. The excess fair value of the reporting unit over the
fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s net assets is the implied goodwill. Significant judgment and
estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting
unit.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of the implied goodwill is highly sensitive to the estimated fair value of the

variety of valuation techniques, including the following:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated fair values reflect assumptions regarding how a market participant would value
the net assets and includes appropriate credit, liquidity, and market risk premiums that are
indicative of the current environment. If the implied fair value of the goodwill for the reporting
unit exceeds the carrying value of the goodwill for the reporting unit, no goodwill impairment is
recorded. Changes in the estimated fair value of the individual assets and liabilities may result
in a different amount of implied goodwill, and the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Future
changes in the fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s net assets may result in future goodwill
impairment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U><I>Impairment of Long-lived Assets</I></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When testing a long-lived
asset for recoverability, it may be necessary to review estimated lives and adjust the depreciation
period. Changes in circumstances and the estimates of future cash flows, as well as evaluating
estimated lives of long-lived assets, are subjective and involve a significant amount of judgment.
A change in the estimated life of a long-lived asset may substantially change depreciation and
amortization expense in subsequent periods. At the BankAtlantic Bancorp level, for purposes of
recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, BankAtlantic Bancorp is required to group
long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of other
assets. These cash flows are based on projections from management reports which are based on
subjective interdepartmental allocations. Real estate inventory and other long-lived real estate
assets are evaluated for impairment on a project-by-project basis. Fair values are not available
for many of our long-lived assets, and estimates must be based on available information, including
prices of similar assets and present value valuation techniques using Level 3 unobservable inputs.
Long-lived assets subject to the above impairment analysis include property and equipment,
internal-use software, real estate inventory and real estate owned.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We generally utilize broker price opinions, third party offers to purchase, discounted cash
flows or third party appraisals to assist us in determining the fair value of real estate
inventory, operating lease contracts and real estate owned. The appraiser or brokers use
professional judgment in determining the fair value of the properties and we may also adjust these
values for changes in market conditions subsequent to the valuation date when current appraisals
are not available. The assumptions used to calculate the fair values are generally Level 3 inputs
and are highly subjective and extremely sensitive to changes in market conditions. The amount
ultimately realized upon the sale of these properties or the termination of operating leases may be
significantly different than the recorded amounts. The assumptions used are representative of
assumptions that we believe market participants would use in determining fair value of these assets
or lease contracts, but different assumptions may result in significantly different results.
BankAtlantic Bancorp also validates its assumptions by comparing completed transactions with its
prior period fair value estimates and may check its assumptions against multiple valuation sources.
The outstanding balance of real estate owned and real estate inventory was $74.5&nbsp;million and
$343.5&nbsp;million, respectively, as of December&nbsp;31, 2010. The minimum lease payments of operating
lease contracts executed for BankAtlantic&#146;s branch expansion were $27.4&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31,
2010. Future events, including declines in real estate values, may result in additional
impairments of long-lived assets or operating leases.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company reviews the carrying amount of its deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if
the establishment of a valuation allowance is necessary. If, based on the available evidence, it
is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets will not be
realized, a deferred tax valuation allowance would be established. Consideration is given to all
positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In evaluating the available evidence, management considers historical financial performance,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">required in assessing future
earnings trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences. The Company&#146;s evaluation is
based on current tax laws as well as management&#146;s expectations of future performance based on its
strategic initiatives. Changes in existing tax laws and future results differing from expectations
may result in significant changes in the deferred tax assets valuation allowance.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our evaluation as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, a net deferred tax asset
valuation allowance was established for the entire amount of the Company and its subsidiaries&#146; net
deferred tax assets as the realization of these assets did not meet the more-likely-than-not
criteria of the Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;). During the fourth quarter of 2008,
market conditions in the financial services industry significantly deteriorated with the
bankruptcies and government bail-outs of large financial services entities. This market turmoil
led to a tightening of credit, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and
widespread reduction in business activity. These economic conditions, as well as the continued
deterioration in real estate markets, especially in Florida, adversely effected BankAtlantic&#146;s
business. As a consequence of the worsening economic conditions during the fourth quarter of 2008,
it appeared more-likely-than-not that the Company and its subsidiaries would not realize its
deferred tax assets resulting in a deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the entire amount of
its net deferred tax assets. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company recognized
significant losses and economic conditions, while showing signs of recovery, did not significantly
improve, resulting in the Company and its subsidiaries maintaining its deferred tax valuation
allowance for the entire amount of its deferred tax asset. However, significant judgment is
required in evaluating the positive and negative evidence for the establishment of the deferred tax
asset valuation allowance, and if future events differ from expectations or if there are changes in
the tax laws, a substantial portion or the entire deferred tax asset benefit may be realized in the
future. The Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets can be carried forward for 20&nbsp;years and applied to
offset future taxable income. In November&nbsp;2009, net operating loss tax laws changed enabling the
Company&#146;s subsidiaries to recognize a benefit in the aggregate of approximately $66.3&nbsp;million
associated with the Company&#146;s 2009 taxable loss. The Company&#146;s subsidiaries received part of the
cash proceeds from the net operating loss carryback during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, and
the Company expects to receive an additional $10.8&nbsp;million when the final review is completed by
the Internal Revenue Service. See Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial statements and related financial data and notes presented herein have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the
measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without
considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the Company&#146;s and its subsidiaries&#146; assets
and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact
on our performance than the effects of general price levels. Although interest rates generally
move in the same direction as inflation, the magnitude of such changes varies. Furthermore, as it
relates to Bluegreen, increases in Bluegreen&#146;s construction and development costs would result in
increases in the sales price of its VOIs. There is no assurance that Bluegreen will be able to
increase or maintain the current level of its sales prices or that increased construction costs
will not have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen&#146;s gross margin. In addition, inflation is
often accompanied by higher interest rates which could have a negative impact on consumer demand
and the costs of financing activities. Rising interest rates as well as increased materials and
labor costs may reduce margins.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General and administrative expenses decreased $4.8&nbsp;million to $25.6&nbsp;million for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010 from $30.4&nbsp;million for 2009. The decrease in general and administrative expenses
in 2010 was primarily attributable to lower compensation and benefits expense and the elimination of public company
related costs since the merger of Woodbridge and BFC in 2009. This was offset in part by higher
accrued audit fees incurred during 2010 and a write-off of intangible assets related to Pizza
Fusion in 2009. Included in general and administrative expenses are fees earned in connection with
certain management advisory services provided by a wholly owned subsidiary of BFC.

totaled $6.3&nbsp;million and $7.4&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
No interest was capitalized for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 while $931,000 was capitalized for
2009. This resulted in interest expense of $6.3&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010,
compared to $6.5&nbsp;million in 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, we wrote-off the full $2.0&nbsp;million of goodwill
related to our investment in Pizza Fusion.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the consolidation of Bluegreen into our consolidated financial statements on November
16, 2009, we accounted for our investment in Bluegreen under the equity method of accounting. Our
interest in Bluegreen&#146;s earnings during the period from January 1 through November&nbsp;16, 2009 was
$32.3&nbsp;million (after the amortization of approximately $28.4&nbsp;million related to the change in the
basis as a result of the impairment charges on this investment during the quarters ended September
30, 2008, December&nbsp;31, 2008 and March&nbsp;31, 2009). We reviewed our investment in Bluegreen for
impairment on a quarterly basis or as events or circumstances warranted for other-than-temporary
declines in value. Based on the results of the evaluations of the investment in Bluegreen, we
recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of approximately $31.2&nbsp;million during the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, we recorded impairment charges of $2.4&nbsp;million on our
investment in Office Depot&#146;s common stock. The Company sold its remaining shares of Office Depot&#146;s
common stock during the fourth quarter of 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in other income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to the same period
in 2009 was primarily due real estate advisory fees. In June&nbsp;2010, BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent
Company and BankAtlantic entered into a real estate advisory service agreement with BFC for
assistance relating to the work-out of loans and the sale of real estate owned. During the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, BFC recognized approximately $787,000 of real estate advisory service fees
under this agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second quarter of 2010, we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $7.6&nbsp;million
resulting from an expected additional tax refund of approximately $5.8&nbsp;million due to a recent
change in IRS guidance, approximately $1.0&nbsp;million of which we anticipate paying to the Debtors&#146;
Estate pursuant to the Settlement Agreement related to the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases, and a tax benefit of
$1.8&nbsp;million associated with a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance from continuing
operations to reflect the future taxable income associated with unrealized gains in accumulated
other comprehensive income. The $1.0&nbsp;million expected to be paid to the Debtors&#146; Estates was
recorded in the (loss)&nbsp;gain on settlement of investment in Woodbridge&#146;s subsidiary and is subject
to change pending a final review of the $5.8&nbsp;million expected tax refund by the IRS. The gain on
settlement of investment in Woodbridge&#146;s subsidiary during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009
reflected the reversal into income of the loss in excess of investment in Levitt and Sons after the
settlement of Levitt and Sons&#146; bankruptcy was finalized, which resulted in a $40.4&nbsp;million gain on
a consolidated basis in the first quarter of 2009. The $40.4&nbsp;million gain was reduced by the $10.7
million accrual, representing the portion of the tax refund due to the Levitt and Sons&#146; estate,
resulting in a $29.7&nbsp;million gain on settlement of investment in Woodbridge&#146;s subsidiary, of which
$16.3&nbsp;million was recorded in the BFC Activities segment.

December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to $36.9&nbsp;million for 2008. The decrease was attributable to lower
professional services as we incurred costs associated with certain of our securities investments in
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 while these costs were not incurred in the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2009, and lower severance charges related to the reductions in workforce
associated with the bankruptcy filing of Levitt and Sons. In addition, we also had lower
insurance costs, as Levitt and Sons&#146; related insurance costs were not incurred after June&nbsp;30, 2008,
and lower incentive expenses. These decreases were offset in part by incurred franchise expenses
related to Pizza Fusion in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, compared to no franchise expenses in
2008 period as we acquired Pizza Fusion in September&nbsp;2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest incurred totaled $7.4&nbsp;million and $8.6&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009
and 2008, respectively, while interest capitalized totaled $931,000 for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2009 and $927,000 for 2008. This resulted in interest expense of $6.5&nbsp;million in the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009, compared to $7.6&nbsp;million in 2008. The decrease in interest expense was mainly
due to the repayment of an intersegment loan in June&nbsp;2008, which resulted in lower interest expense
in 2009, and lower interest rates in 2009 compared to 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, we wrote-off the full amount of goodwill related to
our investment in Pizza Fusion in the amount of $2.0&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the consolidation of Bluegreen into our consolidated financial statements on November
16, 2009, we accounted for our investment in Bluegreen under the equity method of accounting. Our
interest in Bluegreen&#146;s earnings during the period from January 1 through November&nbsp;16, 2009 was
$32.3&nbsp;million (after the amortization of approximately $28.4&nbsp;million related to the change in the
basis as a result of the impairment charges on this investment during the quarters ended September
30, 2008, December&nbsp;31, 2008 and March&nbsp;31, 2009. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, our interest
in Bluegreen&#146;s earnings was $8.8&nbsp;million (after the amortization of approximately $9.2&nbsp;million
related to the change in the basis as a result of the impairment charge on this investment at
September&nbsp;30, 2008). We reviewed our investment in Bluegreen for impairment on a quarterly basis or
as events or circumstances warranted for other-than-temporary declines in value. Based on the
results of the evaluations of the investment in Bluegreen, other-than-temporary impairment charges
of approximately $31.2&nbsp;million and $94.4&nbsp;million were recorded during the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2009 and 2008, respectively. In the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, no other-than-temporary charges
related to the investment in Bluegreen were recorded.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment gains were approximately $6.7&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared
to $2.1&nbsp;million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a gain related to the sale of our
shares in Office Depot during 2009. This was offset by a realized gain on the sale of publicly
traded equity securities in 2008 of approximately $796,000 by venture partnership that BFC
controls.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in other income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to the same period
in 2008 was primarily due to a decline in interest income from approximately $1.6&nbsp;million for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to $3.8&nbsp;million in 2008. This decrease was primarily due to
lower cash balances and lower interest rates in 2009 compared to 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax benefit includes the amount of the expected refund from the Department of the
Treasury of approximately $34.6&nbsp;million. In November&nbsp;2009, the Workers, Homeownership, and Business
Assistance Act of 2009 (the &#147;Act&#148;) was enacted. The Act includes a provision that allows most
businesses to elect to increase the net operating loss (&#147;NOLs&#148;) carryback period from two years
under current law to as much as five years for NOLs generated in either 2008 or 2009 (but not
both). BFC anticipates that this election will benefit the Company by allowing it to carryback
Woodbridge&#146;s NOLs that were generated in 2008 and obtain refunds of taxes paid in the carryback
years.

was accounted for as a step acquisition under the purchase method of accounting then in effect.
Accordingly, the assets and liabilities acquired were revalued to reflect market values at the date

being accreted or amortized, net of tax, over the remaining life of the assets and liabilities.

Bancorp&#146;s loans receivable, properties and equipment and other assets, respectively, partially
offset by the effect of purchase accounting associated with core deposit intangible asset of
approximately $2.3&nbsp;million. In 2009, the net impact of purchase accounting increased our
consolidated net loss by approximately $5.9&nbsp;million, including an $8.9&nbsp;million loss due to the
purchase accounting associated with Core&#146;s real estate impairment, partially offset by the effect
of purchase accounting associated with property and equipment of approximately $1.2&nbsp;million, loans
receivable of approximately $2.2&nbsp;million and goodwill of approximately $583,000. In 2008, the net
impact of purchase accounting decreased our consolidated net loss by approximately $8.4&nbsp;million, of
which approximately $4.7&nbsp;million and $1.7&nbsp;million was due to effects of purchase accounting
associated with the investment in Bluegreen and goodwill, respectively.

totaling approximately $29&nbsp;million and $45&nbsp;million, respectively. The decrease in cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments was due to BFC&#146;s operating and general and administrative
expenses, junior subordinated debentures interest payments of approximately $6.0&nbsp;million, and the
purchase of shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock in BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s 2010
rights offering to its shareholders. This decrease was offset in part by the receipt of an income
tax refund, net of amounts owed to the Levitt and Sons bankruptcy estate resulting from recent tax
law changes as discussed below.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2010, BFC acquired an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock in connection with the exercise of subscription rights granted to it in BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s rights offering. The aggregate purchase price for those shares was $15.0&nbsp;million. BFC
exercised its basic subscription rights to purchase 5,986,865 shares, and the remaining 4,013,135
shares were acquired by BFC pursuant to its over-subscription request. The shares acquired in the
rights offering increased BFC&#146;s ownership interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp by approximately 8% to
45% and BFC&#146;s voting interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp by approximately 5% to 71%.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise noted, the debts and obligations of BankAtlantic Bancorp, Bluegreen and
Woodbridge are not direct obligations of BFC and generally are non-recourse to BFC. Similarly, the
assets of those entities are not available to BFC, absent a dividend or distribution from those
entities. BFC&#146;s principal sources of liquidity are its available cash, short-term investments,
dividends or distributions from our subsidiaries and dividends from Benihana. As discussed further
in this report, recent tax law changes have resulted in the receipt of significant tax refunds. We
have received approximately $29.2&nbsp;million of tax refunds and expect to receive an additional
approximately $10.8&nbsp;million when the final review is completed by the Internal Revenue Service.
Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement relating to the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases, we agreed that a portion of
the tax refund attributable to the Debtors&#146; Estate for periods prior to the bankruptcy would be
paid to the estate, and it is estimated that approximately $11.7&nbsp;million will be paid to the
Debtors&#146; Estate pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will use our available funds to fund operations and meet our obligations. We may also use
available funds to make additional investments in the companies within our consolidated group,
invest in equity securities and other investments, or repurchase shares of our common stock
pursuant to our share repurchase program.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since March&nbsp;2009, BFC has not received cash dividends from BankAtlantic Bancorp. BankAtlantic
Bancorp is currently prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock without first receiving a
written non-objection from the OTS. In addition, during February&nbsp;2009, BankAtlantic
Bancorp elected to exercise its right to defer payments of interest on its trust preferred junior
subordinated debt. BankAtlantic Bancorp is permitted to defer quarterly interest payments for up to
20 consecutive quarters. During the deferral period, BankAtlantic Bancorp is prohibited from paying
dividends to its shareholders, including BFC. While BankAtlantic Bancorp can end the deferral
period at any time, BankAtlantic Bancorp has indicated that it anticipates that it may continue to
defer such interest payments for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, BFC has not received cash
dividends from Bluegreen and does not expect to receive cash dividends from Bluegreen in the
foreseeable future. Certain of Bluegreen&#146;s credit facilities contain terms which may limit the
payment of cash dividends.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC, on a parent company only basis, has committed that it will not, without the prior written

aggregate cost of no more than $10&nbsp;million. The share repurchase program replaced our $10&nbsp;million

on the number of shares which could be repurchased under the program at 1,750,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development activities at Carolina Oak, which is within Tradition Hilton Head, were
suspended in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of, among other things, an overall softening of
demand for new homes and a decline in the overall economy. In 2009, the housing industry continued
to face significant challenges and Woodbridge made the decision to cease all activities at Carolina
Oak. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we reviewed the inventory of real estate at Carolina Oak for
impairment and, as a result, recorded a $16.7&nbsp;million impairment charge to adjust the carrying
amount of Carolina Oak&#146;s inventory to its fair value of
$10.8&nbsp;million. Woodbridge is the obligor under a $37.2&nbsp;million loan that is collateralized by the Carolina Oak property. During 2009, the
lender declared the loan to be in default and filed an action for foreclosure. While there may have
been an issue with respect to compliance with certain covenants in the loan documents, we do not
believe that an event of default occurred. Through participation in a court-ordered mediation of
this matter, the parties agreed to tentative terms to settle the matter and are currently
negotiating a formal settlement agreement. It is currently expected that this settlement
agreement, if finalized, will provide for (i)&nbsp;Woodbridge to pay $2.5&nbsp;million to the investor group,
(ii)&nbsp;Carolina Oak to convey to the investor group the real property securing the loan via a
stipulated foreclosure or deed in lieu, (iii)&nbsp;the investor group to release Woodbridge and Carolina
Oak from their obligations relating to the debt or, alternatively, to agree not to pursue certain
remedies, including a deficiency judgment, that would otherwise be available to them, in each case
subject to certain conditions, and (iv)&nbsp;the litigation to be dismissed. There is no assurance that
the settlement will be finalized on the contemplated terms, or at all.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, Woodbridge entered into a settlement agreement, as amended (the &#147;Settlement
Agreement&#148;), with the Debtors and the Joint Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the &#147;Joint
Committee&#148;) appointed in the Chapter&nbsp;11 cases related to the Levitt and Sons bankruptcy filing.
Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, among other things, (i)&nbsp;Woodbridge agreed to pay $8&nbsp;million
to the Levitt and Sons bankruptcy estates (the &#147;Debtors Estate&#148;), establish a $4.5&nbsp;million release
fund to be disbursed to third party creditors in exchange for a third party release and injunction,
pay an additional $300,000 to a deposit holders fund and waive and release substantially all of the
claims it had against the Debtors, including its administrative expense claims through July&nbsp;2008,
and (ii)&nbsp;the Debtors (joined by the Joint Committee) agreed to waive and release any claims they
had against Woodbridge and its affiliates. The Settlement Agreement also provided that if, within
one year after the Bankruptcy Court&#146;s confirmation of the Settlement Agreement, Section&nbsp;172 of the
Internal Revenue Code was amended to permit a carry back of tax losses from calendar years 2007 or
2008 to one or more years preceding calendar year 2005, then Woodbridge would share a portion of
any resulting tax refund with the Debtors and the Joint Committee based on an agreed upon formula.
The Settlement Agreement was subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of the
Bankruptcy Court. On February&nbsp;20, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming a plan of
liquidation jointly proposed by Levitt and Sons and the Joint Committee. That order also approved
the settlement pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. No appeal or rehearing of the Bankruptcy
Court&#146;s order was timely filed by any party, and the settlement was consummated on March&nbsp;3, 2009,
at which time payment was made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Settlement
Agreement. Under cost method accounting, the cost of settlement and the related $52.9&nbsp;million
liability (less $500,000 which was determined as the settlement holdback and remained as an accrual
pursuant to the Settlement Agreement) was recognized into income in the first quarter of 2009,
resulting in a $40.4&nbsp;million gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2009, the Workers, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 (the &#147;Act&#148;)
was enacted. The Act extended the net operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;) carry-back period from two years to up
to five years for the 2008 and 2009 tax years and, as a result, allowed us to increase our NOL
carryback period to as much as five years for NOLs generated in 2008 or 2009 and obtain refunds of
taxes paid in the newly included carryback years. The amount of the expected refund to the Company
has been determined to be approximately $40.0&nbsp;million, of which approximately $29.2&nbsp;million has
been received. The balance of the tax refund claim of approximately $10.8&nbsp;million will most likely
be paid when the Internal Revenue Service completes its review. As described above, under the
terms of the Settlement Agreement, a portion of the refund will be payable to the Debtors Estate.
Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2009, we accrued approximately $10.7&nbsp;million in connection
with the portion of the tax refund which may be payable to the Debtors Estate pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement. The gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary of $40.4&nbsp;million recorded
in the first quarter of 2009 was reduced by the $10.7&nbsp;million accrual recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2009 resulting in a $29.7&nbsp;million gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2010, we increased the $10.7
million accrual by approximately $1.0&nbsp;million, representing the portion of an additional tax refund
which we expect to receive due to a recent change in Internal Revenue Service guidance that will
likely be required to be paid to the Debtors Estate pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2010, we have a liability of approximately $11.7&nbsp;million, representing the portion of
tax refunds to be shared with the Debtors Estate pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2010, $8.4&nbsp;million of the $11.7&nbsp;million portion of the tax refund to be paid to the
Debtors Estate was received and placed in an escrow account. The $8.4&nbsp;million amount is included as
restricted cash in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, BFC and Woodbridge consummated their merger pursuant to which
Woodbridge merged with BFC. In connection with the merger, Dissenting Holders who collectively held
approximately 4.2&nbsp;million shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock exercised their appraisal
rights and are entitled to receive an amount equal to the fair value of their shares calculated in
accordance with Florida law. The Dissenting Holders have rejected Woodbridge&#146;s offer of $1.10 per
share and requested payment for their shares based on their respective fair value estimates of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. In December&nbsp;2009, the Company recorded a $4.6&nbsp;million liability
with a corresponding reduction to additional paid-in capital representing, in the aggregate,
Woodbridge&#146;s offer to the Dissenting Holders. However, the appraisal rights litigation is currently
ongoing and its outcome is uncertain. There is no assurance as to the amount of cash that we will
be required to pay to the Dissenting Holders, which amount may be greater than the $4.6&nbsp;million
that we have accrued.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company owns 800,000 shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock, which it purchased
for $25.00 per share. The Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into Benihana&#146;s common stock.
Based on the number of currently outstanding shares of Benihana&#146;s capital stock, the Convertible
Preferred Stock, if converted, would represent an approximate 19% voting interest and an
approximate 9% economic interest in Benihana&#146;s capital stock. The Company receives cumulative
quarterly dividends on its shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock at an annual rate equal
to 5% or $1.25 per share, payable on the last day of each calendar quarter. The Convertible
Preferred Stock is subject to mandatory redemption of $20&nbsp;million plus accumulated dividends on
July&nbsp;2, 2014 unless we elect to extend the mandatory redemption date to a date not later than July
2, 2024. Benihana is currently considering strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of the
company. In the event that a sale transaction is consummated the
Company would receive a minimum of $20 million in consideration for
its shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;21, 2004, the Company sold 15,000 shares of its 5% Preferred Stock to an investor
group in a private offering. The Company&#146;s 5% Preferred Stock has a stated value of $1,000 per
share. The shares of 5% Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Company, from time to
time, at redemption prices ranging from $1,025 per share for the year 2011 to $1,000 per share for
the year 2015 and thereafter. The 5% Preferred Stock liquidation preference is equal to its stated
value of $1,000 per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends or an amount equal to the
applicable redemption price in a voluntary liquidation or winding up of the Company. Holders of the
5% Preferred Stock have no voting rights, except as provided by Florida law, and are entitled to
receive, when and as declared by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors, cumulative quarterly cash
dividends on each such share at a rate per annum of 5% of the stated value from the date of
issuance. Since June&nbsp;2004, the Company has paid quarterly dividends on the 5% Preferred Stock of
$187,500. On December&nbsp;17, 2008, the Company amended certain of the previously designated relative
rights, preferences and limitations of the Company&#146;s 5% Preferred Stock. The amendment eliminated
the right of the holders of the 5% Preferred Stock to convert their shares of Preferred Stock into
shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The amendment also requires the Company to redeem
shares of the 5% Preferred Stock with the net proceeds it receives in the event (i)&nbsp;the Company
sells any of its shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock, (ii)&nbsp;the Company sells any
shares of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock received upon conversion of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred
Stock or (iii)&nbsp;Benihana redeems any shares of its Convertible Preferred Stock owned by the Company.
Additionally, in the event the Company defaults on its obligation to make dividend payments on its
5% Preferred Stock, the amendment entitles the holders of the 5% Preferred Stock, in place of the
Company, to receive directly from Benihana certain payments on the shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible
Preferred Stock owned by the Company or on the shares of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock received by the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC/CCC has a 10% interest in a limited liability company that
owned two commercial properties in Hillsborough County, Florida. During the fourth quarter of 2010,
the limited liability company recorded an impairment charge related to these properties, $1.9
million of which was recognized by BFC/CCC&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary. The $1.9&nbsp;million impairment
charge exceeded the carrying value of our investment. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company classified
the negative basis of the investment of approximately $1.3&nbsp;million in other liabilities on the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the carrying amount
of this investment was approximately $690,000, and is included as an asset in investments in
unconsolidated affiliates in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. In
connection with the purchase of the commercial properties in November&nbsp;2006, BFC and the
unaffiliated member each guaranteed the payment of up to a maximum of $5.0&nbsp;million for certain
environmental indemnities and specific obligations that are not related to the financial
performance of the assets. BFC and the unaffiliated member also entered into a cross
indemnification agreement which limits BFC&#146;s obligations under the guarantee to acts of BFC and its
affiliates. On March&nbsp;25, 2011, the limited liability company reached a settlement with its lender
and has conveyed the commercial properties securing the loan via a deed in lieu of foreclosure. BFC
and BFC/CCC&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary were released from all obligations and guarantees related to
the two commercial properties.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC/CCC has a 50% limited partner interest in a limited
partnership that has a 10% interest in a limited liability company that owns an office building in
Tampa, Florida. At December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying amount of this investment was
approximately $282,000 and $319,000, respectively, which is included in investments in
unconsolidated affiliates in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. In
connection with the purchase of the office building by the limited liability company in June&nbsp;2007,
BFC guaranteed the payment of certain environmental indemnities and specific obligations that are
not related to the financial performance of the asset up to a maximum of $15.0&nbsp;million, or $25.0
million in the event of any petition or involuntary proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or
similar state insolvency laws or in the event of any transfer of interests not in accordance with
the loan documents. BFC and the unaffiliated members also entered into a cross indemnification
agreement which limits BFC&#146;s obligations under the guarantee to acts of BFC and its affiliates. No
amounts are recorded in the Company&#146;s financial statements for the obligations associated with this
guarantee based on the potential indemnification by unaffiliated members and the limit of the
specific obligations to non-financial matters.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Real Estate Operations Segment</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Real Estate Operations segment includes the subsidiaries through which Woodbridge
historically conducted its real estate business activities. These activities were concentrated in
Florida and South Carolina and included the development and sale of land, the construction and sale
of single family homes and townhomes and the leasing of commercial properties through Core prior to
its liquidation in 2010 and Carolina Oak, which was engaged in homebuilding activities in South
Carolina prior to the suspension of those activities in the fourth quarter of 2008. The Real Estate
Operations segment includes the operations of Cypress Creek Holdings, which engages in leasing
activities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge&#146;s operations historically were concentrated in the real estate industry which is
cyclical in nature. During 2010, the demand for residential and commercial inventory showed no
signs of recovery, particularly in the geographic regions where Core&#146;s properties are located. In
early 2010, Woodbridge made the decision to pursue an orderly liquidation of Core and worked
cooperatively with various lenders to achieve that objective. During November&nbsp;2010, Core entered
into a settlement agreement with one of its lenders, which had previously commenced actions seeking
foreclosure of mortgage loans totaling approximately $113.9&nbsp;million collateralized by property in
Florida and South Carolina. Under the terms of the agreement, Core pledged additional collateral to
the lender consisting of membership interests in five of Core&#146;s subsidiaries and granted security
interests in the acreage owned by such subsidiaries in Port St. Lucie, Florida, substantially all
of which is undeveloped raw land. Core also agreed to an amendment of the complaint related to the
Florida foreclosure action to include this additional collateral and an entry into consensual
judgments of foreclosure in both the Florida and South Carolina foreclosure actions. In
consideration therefor, the lender agreed not to enforce a deficiency judgment against Core and,
during February&nbsp;2011, released Core from any other claims arising from or relating to the loans.
As of November&nbsp;30, 2010, Core deconsolidated the five subsidiaries, the membership interests in
which were transferred to the lender upon entry into the consensual judgments of foreclosure. In
connection therewith and in accordance with accounting guidance for consolidation, a guarantee
obligation &#147;deferred gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary&#148; of $11.3&nbsp;million was recorded and is
included in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as of December&nbsp;31, 2010.
The deferred gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary was recognized into income in the Company&#146;s
Consolidated Statement of Operations at the time Core received its general release of liability in
February&nbsp;2011.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2010, Core and one of its subsidiaries entered agreements, including without
limitation, a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure Agreement, with one of their lenders which resolved the
foreclosure proceedings commenced by the lender related to property at Tradition Hilton Head which
served as collateral for a $25&nbsp;million loan. Pursuant to the agreements, Core&#146;s subsidiary
transferred to the lender all of its right, title and interest in and to the property which served
as collateral for the loan as well as certain additional real and personal property. In
consideration therefor, the lender released Core and its subsidiary from any claims arising from or
relating to the loan. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, this transaction was
accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring and, accordingly, a $13.0&nbsp;million gain on debt
extinguishment was recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2009, Core Communities reinitiated efforts to sell two of its commercial leasing
projects (the &#147;Projects&#148;) and began soliciting bids from several potential buyers to purchase
assets associated with the Projects. Due to this decision, the assets associated with the
Projects were reclassified as assets held for sale and the liabilities related to these assets were
reclassified as liabilities related to assets held for sale in the Consolidated Statements of
Financial Condition. Accordingly, the results of operations for the Projects are included in the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Operations in discontinued operations. On June&nbsp;10, 2010, Core
sold the Projects for approximately $75.4&nbsp;million. As a result of the sale, a $2.6&nbsp;million gain on
sale of discontinued operations was realized in the second quarter of 2010. See Note 6 of the
&#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for further information.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2009, the housing industry continued to face significant challenges and Woodbridge made the
decision to cease all activities at Carolina Oak. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we reviewed the
inventory of real estate at Carolina Oak for impairment and, as a result, recorded a $16.7&nbsp;million
impairment charge to adjust the carrying amount of Carolina Oak&#146;s inventory to its fair value of
$10.8&nbsp;million. Woodbridge is the obligor under a $37.2&nbsp;million loan that is collateralized by
the Carolina Oak property. During 2009, the lender declared the loan to be in default and filed an
action for foreclosure. While there may have been an issue with respect to compliance with certain
covenants in the loan documents, we do not believe that an event of default occurred. Through
participation in a court-ordered mediation of this matter, the parties agreed to tentative terms to
settle the matter and are currently negotiating a formal settlement

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of real estate decreased to $2.7&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2010 from $6.6&nbsp;million for 2009. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, Core sold approximately 8
acres, generating revenues of approximately $2.5&nbsp;million, compared to the sale of approximately 13
acres, which generated revenues of approximately $1.1&nbsp;million in 2009. Core did not recognize
deferred revenue for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, but recognized approximately $5.3&nbsp;million on
previously sold land for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. Core did not recognize any look back
revenue for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 while an insignificant amount was recognized for the
same period in 2009. There were no home sales at Carolina Oak in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010.
During 2009, Carolina Oak generated $320,000 in revenues from the sale of 1 unit.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other revenues decreased to $1.4&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to $2.3
million for 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower rental income as a tenant did not renew

from $82.1&nbsp;million for 2009 due to the recognition of lower impairment charges associated with
inventory of real estate and decreased sales and selling efforts during 2010. We recorded
approximately $20.8&nbsp;million of impairment charges in 2010 compared to $80.3&nbsp;million in 2009. Costs
of sales of real estate before impairment charges for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009
were $2.4&nbsp;million and $1.8&nbsp;million, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $9.5&nbsp;million for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010 from $16.4&nbsp;million in 2009. The decrease reflected the ceasing of real estate
activities at Core, including specifically lower compensation and benefits expense and lower office
related expenses reflecting a reduction in force at Core in 2009 and 2010, lower sales and
marketing expenses as neither Core nor Carolina Oak engaged in advertising activities for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, and lower developer expenses related to property owner associations in
Tradition, Florida. In addition, there was lower severance expense at Core for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to 2009. These decreases were slightly offset by an increase in
professional services related to the restructuring and property tax expenses in the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gain
on extinguishment of debt consists of the above described $13.0&nbsp;million gain attributable to the
troubled debt restructuring relating to the resolution of a $25&nbsp;million loan made to a subsidiary
of Core, as to which Core was secondarily liable as a guarantor. See Note 2 of the &#147;Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for further details.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest incurred totaled $12.7&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and $8.3&nbsp;million
for 2009 period. No interest was capitalized in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to $2.0
for 2009 period. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, we recorded interest expense at the
default rate of interest in accordance with the terms of our loan agreements. Additionally, during
the third quarter of 2009, the Company ceased capitalizing interest in light of the significantly
reduced development activities in Florida and the suspended development activities in South
Carolina. These factors resulted in a net higher interest expense recognized in the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to 2009. Historically, the capitalized interest allocated to inventory
is charged to cost of sales as land and homes are sold. Cost of sales of real estate for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 did not include any significant amounts of previously capitalized
interest.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other expense decreased to $3.9&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 from $5.4&nbsp;million
in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower impairment charges related to property and
equipment held at Cypress Creek Holdings and Core recorded for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010
compared to 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income from discontinued operations, all of which related to Core&#146;s Projects, increased to
$2.5&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 from a loss of $15.6&nbsp;million in 2009. The
increase includes the impact of a gain of approximately $2.6&nbsp;million recorded in connection with
the sale of the Projects in June&nbsp;2010.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of real estate decreased to $6.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2009 from $13.8&nbsp;million for 2008. Revenues from sales of real estate for the years ended December
31, 2009 and 2008 were comprised of land and home sales, recognition of deferred revenue and look
back revenue. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, Core sold approximately 13 acres, generating
revenues of approximately $1.1&nbsp;million, compared to the sale of approximately 35 acres, which
generated revenues of approximately $9.1&nbsp;million, net of deferred revenue, in 2008. Core recognized
deferred revenue on previously sold land of approximately $5.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December
31, 2009, compared to approximately $1.9&nbsp;million in 2008. Look back revenues for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $32,000 and $145,000, respectively. We also earned
$320,000 in revenues in 2009 from sales of real estate as a result of 1 unit sold in Carolina Oak,
compared to revenues from sales of real estate of $2.5&nbsp;million in 2008 as a result of 8 units sold
in Carolina Oak.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other revenues decreased to $2.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to $3.0
million for 2008. The decrease in other revenues was primarily due to a decrease in marketing fees
collected at Core Communities and fewer impact fees earned in 2009 compared to 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of sales of real estate increased to $82.1&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009
from $22.7&nbsp;million for 2008 due to impairment charges of $80.3&nbsp;million associated with inventory of
real estate recorded in 2009 compared to $13.7&nbsp;million in impairment charges of inventory of real
estate in 2008. Costs of sales of real estate before impairment charges for the years ended

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The decrease in cost of sales of real estate excluding impairment charges was due to a decrease in sales of real estate
at Core and Carolina Oak in 2009 compared to 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $16.4&nbsp;million for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009 from $20.6&nbsp;million for 2008. The decrease was a result of, among other things,
lower sales and marketing expenses as a result of a reduced marketing budget, lower developer
expenses related to property owner associations in Tradition, Florida, lower compensation and
benefits expense, and lower office related expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an
increase in severance charges as a result of reductions in force at Core in 2009 and an increase in
property tax expense.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest incurred totaled $8.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $11.0&nbsp;million
for 2008. Interest capitalized totaled $2.0&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $8.9
million for 2008. Net interest expense increased in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 primarily as a result of the Company&#146;s decision to stop the
capitalization of interest in light of the significantly reduced development activities in Florida
and the ceasing of development activities in South Carolina. The increase was partially offset by
lower interest rates during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to 2008. Historically, the
capitalized interest allocated to inventory is charged to cost of sales. Cost of sales of real
estate for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 included previously capitalized interest of
approximately $64,000 and $268,000, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest and other income decreased to $526,000 during 2009 from $3.3&nbsp;million during 2008.
This decrease was primarily due to lower forfeited deposits received in 2009, and the repayment of
an intersegment loan in June&nbsp;2008, of which the related interest was eliminated in consolidation.
</DIV>




<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income from discontinued operations, which relates to the income generated by Core&#146;s Projects,
decreased to a loss of $15.6&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 from income of $2.8
million in 2008. The decrease was mainly due to impairment charges in the amount of $13.6&nbsp;million
recorded in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to no impairment charges recorded in 2008. In
addition, three ground lease parcels comprised of approximately 5 acres were sold in 2008 and were
accounted for as discontinued operations and resulted in a $2.5&nbsp;million gain on sale of real estate
assets for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, compared to no comparable sales in discontinued
operations in 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of acres subject to third party sales contracts was approximately $2.5&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to $1.1&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008. While backlog is not an exclusive
indicator of future sales activity, it provides an indication of potential future sales activity.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010 and December&nbsp;31, 2009, Core had cash and cash equivalents of $1.0&nbsp;million
and $2.9&nbsp;million, respectively. Cash decreased by $1.9&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2010 primarily due to the payment of Core&#146;s general and administrative expenses, including legal
and professional fees and severance payments in connection with the winding up of Core&#146;s operations
in Florida and South Carolina. Legal and professional fees include payments to the receiver for
services related to the settlement of Core&#146;s defaulted debt with its lenders.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2009, the recession continued and the demand for residential and commercial inventory
showed no signs of recovery, particularly in the geographic regions where Core&#146;s properties are
located. The decrease in land sales in 2009 and continued cash flow deficits contributed to, among
other things, the deterioration of Core&#146;s liquidity. As a result, Core ceased all development in
Tradition, Florida and Tradition Hilton Head. In early 2010, Woodbridge made the decision to
pursue an orderly liquidation of Core and worked cooperatively with various lenders to achieve that
objective. During November&nbsp;2010, Core entered into a settlement agreement with one of its lenders,
which had previously commenced actions seeking foreclosure of mortgage loans totaling approximately
$113.9&nbsp;million collateralized by property in Florida and South Carolina. Under the terms of the
agreement, Core pledged additional collateral to the lender consisting of membership interests in
five of Core&#146;s subsidiaries and granted security interests in the acreage owned by such
subsidiaries in Port St. Lucie, Florida, substantially all of which is undeveloped raw land.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Core also agreed to an amendment of the complaint related to the Florida foreclosure action to include
this additional collateral and an entry into consensual judgments of foreclosure in both the
Florida and South Carolina foreclosure actions. In consideration therefore, the lender agreed not
to enforce a deficiency judgment against Core and, during February&nbsp;2011, released Core from any
other claims arising from or relating to the loans. As of November&nbsp;30, 2010,
Core deconsolidated the five subsidiaries, the membership interests in which were transferred
to the lender upon entry into the consensual judgments of foreclosure. In connection therewith and
in accordance with the accounting guidance for consolidation, Woodbridge recorded a guarantee
obligation &#147;deferred gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary&#148; of $11.3&nbsp;million in the Company&#146;s
Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as of December&nbsp;31,
2010. The deferred gain on settlement of
investment in subsidiary was recognized into income in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of
Operations at the time Core received its general release of liability in February&nbsp;2011. See Notes 2
and 23 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for further information.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2010, Core and one of its subsidiaries entered agreements, including without
limitation, a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure Agreement, with one of their lenders which resolved the
foreclosure proceedings commenced by the lender related to property at Tradition Hilton Head which
served as collateral for a $25&nbsp;million loan. Pursuant to the agreements, Core&#146;s subsidiary
transferred to the lender all of its right, title and interest in and to the property which served
as collateral for the loan as well as certain additional real and personal property. In
consideration therefor, the lender released Core and its subsidiary from any claims arising from or
relating to the loan. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, this transaction was
accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring and, accordingly, a $13.0&nbsp;million gain on debt
extinguishment was recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2009, Core Communities reinitiated efforts to sell two of its commercial leasing
projects (the &#147;Projects&#148;) and began soliciting bids from several potential buyers to purchase
assets associated with the Projects. Due to this decision, the assets associated with the
Projects were reclassified as assets held for sale and the liabilities related to these assets were
reclassified as liabilities related to assets held for sale in the Consolidated Statements of
Financial Condition. Accordingly, the results of operations for the Projects are included in the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Operations in discontinued operations. On June&nbsp;10, 2010, Core
sold the Projects for approximately $75.4&nbsp;million. As a result of the sale, a $2.6&nbsp;million gain on
sale of discontinued operations was realized in the second quarter of 2010. See Note 6 of the
&#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for further information.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levitt and Sons, Woodbridge&#146;s former wholly-owned homebuilding subsidiary, had approximately
$33.3&nbsp;million of surety bonds related to its ongoing projects at November&nbsp;9, 2007, the date on
which Levitt and Sons and substantially all of its subsidiaries filed voluntary bankruptcy
petitions. In the event that these obligations are drawn and paid by the surety, Woodbridge could
be responsible for up to $7.6&nbsp;million plus costs and expenses in accordance with the surety
indemnity agreements executed by Woodbridge. At December&nbsp;31, 2010 and December&nbsp;31, 2009, Woodbridge
had $490,000 and $527,000, respectively, in surety bond accruals related to certain bonds
where management believes it to be probable that Woodbridge will be required to reimburse the
surety under applicable indemnity agreements. Woodbridge reimbursed the surety approximately
$348,000 and $532,000 during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in accordance
with the indemnity agreement for bond claims paid during the period. No reimbursements were made in
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. It is unclear whether and to what extent the remaining
outstanding surety bonds of Levitt and Sons will be drawn and the extent to which Woodbridge may be
responsible for additional amounts beyond the previous accrued amount. Woodbridge will not receive
any repayment, assets or other consideration as recovery of any amounts it may be required to pay.
In September&nbsp;2008, a surety filed a lawsuit to require Woodbridge to post collateral against a
portion of the surety bonds exposure in connection with demands made by a municipality. Based on
claims made by the municipality on the bonds, the surety requested that Woodbridge post a $4.0
million escrow deposit while the matter was being litigated. While Woodbridge did not believe that
the municipality had the right to demand payment under the bonds, Woodbridge complied with that
request. In August&nbsp;2010, a motion for summary judgment was entered in Woodbridge&#146;s favor
terminating any obligations under the bonds. The municipality has appealed the decision.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>The Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and for the
Interim Period (the period from November&nbsp;16, 2009, the date on which the Company acquired
additional shares of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock resulting in the Company having a controlling
interest in Bluegreen, through December&nbsp;31, 2009) include the results of operations of Bluegreen.
Bluegreen&#146;s results of operations are reported through two reportable segments, which are Bluegreen
Resorts and Bluegreen Communities. Prior to November&nbsp;16, 2009, our earnings attributable to
Bluegreen were reported as part of Woodbridge other operations, which is currently included in the
BFC Activities segment. Bluegreen is a separate public company, and the following discussion is
derived from or includes disclosure prepared by Bluegreen&#146;s management and included in its Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. Accordingly, unless noted to the
contrary or the context otherwise requires, references to the &#147;Company&#148;, &#147;we&#148;, &#147;us&#148; or &#147;our&#148; in the
following discussion are references to Bluegreen and its subsidiaries, and are not references to
BFC.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen&#146;s 2010 results reflect an increased focus on its fee-based service business and its
continuing efforts to improve cash flows from operations through initiatives designed to increase
cash received upon sales of VOIs and to achieve selling and marketing efficiencies in its
Bluegreen Resorts segment. While Bluegreen believes that its cash flows from operations and its
Bluegreen Resorts business operating results reflect the success of these efforts, the Bluegreen
Communities business continued to be impacted by low consumer demand for homesites. On March&nbsp;24,
2011, Bluegreen announced that it has engaged advisors to explore strategic alternatives for
Bluegreen Communities, including a possible sale of the division. There can be no assurance,
however, the timing or whether Bluegreen will elect to pursue any of the strategic alternatives
Bluegreen may consider, or that such alternatives, if pursued and ultimately consummated, will
result in improvements to its financial condition and operating results or otherwise achieve the
benefits Bluegreen expects to realize from the transaction.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, Bluegreen adopted ASU 2009-16
and ASU 2009-17 effective January&nbsp;1, 2010, which resulted in consolidation of the special purpose
finance entities associated with past securitization transactions which were previously reported
&#147;off-balance sheet.&#148; In addition to the material changes to Bluegreen&#146;s consolidated balance
sheet, the consolidation of these special purpose finance entities impacted our <I>Consolidated
Statement of Operations </I>during 2010, by increasing Bluegreen&#146;s interest income from VOI notes
receivable and increasing interest expense on notes payable compared to prior periods. Bluegreen&#146;s
statements of operations for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 and its balance sheet as of
December&nbsp;31, 2009 have not been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASU 2009-16 and
ASU 2009-17. Therefore, 2010 results will not be comparable to prior period amounts, particularly
with regards to: vacation ownership sales and services; interest expense and interest income.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen believes its fee-based service business enables Bluegreen to leverage its
management, sales and marketing, mortgage servicing, title and construction experience to generate
fee-based-service relationships with third parties. Bluegreen&#146;s provision of these services requires significantly less capital
investment than its traditional vacation ownership business. Bluegreen began selling and
marketing third party vacation ownership inventory in July of 2009, and during 2010, Bluegreen sold
$78.8&nbsp;million, of third-party inventory and earned sales and marketing commissions of approximately
$53.0&nbsp;million. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen had six fee-based sales and marketing service
contracts as compared to four at December&nbsp;31, 2009. In addition to the sales and marketing of
third-party VOIs, Bluegreen also generated fee-based income by providing resort and reservation
management services, title services, construction consulting services (where Bluegreen manages the
construction, design and development of VOI inventory for third parties), and mortgage servicing of
the VOI notes originated from the sales of certain of the third-party VOIs. Bluegreen&#146;s goal is for
fee-based services to become an increasing portion of its resorts business over time, however,
there is no assurance that this will be the case.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, consistent with Bluegreen&#146;s initiatives to improve liquidity, Bluegreen further
increased both the percentage of its sales that are 100% cash and its average down payment on
financed sales. Including down payments received on financed sales, 54% of Bluegreen&#146;s sales were
received in cash within approximately 30&nbsp;days from the contract date in 2010. Refer to <I>Liquidity
and Capital Resources </I>section below for additional information.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen believes that its other resort fee-based services and finance operations represent
recurring cash-generating sources of income which do not require material liquidity support from
the credit markets. Bluegreen also believes, based on anticipated sales levels, that it has
adequate timeshare inventory to satisfy its projected sales for a number of years. However,
Bluegreen Resorts&#146; sales and marketing operations are materially dependent on the availability of
liquidity in the credit markets, as further discussed in the <I>Liquidity and Capital Resources</I>
section below. Due to a significant reduction of liquidity in the receivable-backed credit markets
commencing in the fourth quarter of 2008, and due to Bluegreen&#146;s continued desire to manage
efficiencies of its timeshare marketing costs, Bluegreen purposely and significantly reduced its
sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2008 and thereafter. Since that time, Bluegreen has and
intends to continue to adjust its sales volumes based on available liquidity in the receivable
credit markets, its level of cash sales and its ability to achieve desired levels of marketing
efficiencies.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen&#146;s Communities business has been, and continues to be, adversely impacted by the
deterioration in the real estate markets. Bluegreen has experienced a material decrease in demand,
and a significant decrease in sales volume. Bluegreen has significantly reduced prices on certain
of its homesites in an attempt to increase sales activity. During 2010, Bluegreen recorded non-cash
impairment charges of $14.9&nbsp;million to write down the carrying amount of certain phases of its
communities properties to their estimated fair value less cost to sell. On March&nbsp;24, 2011,
Bluegreen announced that it had engaged advisors to explore strategic alternatives for Bluegreen
Communities, including the possible sale of the division. There can be no assurance, however,
regarding the timing or whether Bluegreen will elect to pursue any of the strategic alternatives
Bluegreen may consider, or that any such alternatives, if pursued and ultimately consummated, will
result in improvements to Bluegreen&#146;s financial condition and operating results or otherwise
achieve the benefits it may expect to realize from the transaction. In the event that adverse
conditions in the real estate market continue or deteriorate further, the carrying value of its
Bluegreen Communities inventory would be reevaluated and could result in additional material
impairment charges. Impairment charges may also be required to the extent that additional market
information obtained during the strategic review process indicates that the carrying value of
Bluegreen&#146;s Communities inventory exceeds its fair value.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen has historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal
fluctuations in its gross revenues and results of operations. This seasonality may result in
fluctuations in its quarterly operating results. Although Bluegreen typically sees more potential
customers at its sales offices during the quarters ending in June and September, ultimate
recognition of the resulting sales during these periods may be delayed due to down payment
requirements for recognition of real estate sales under GAAP or due to the timing of development
and the requirement that Bluegreen uses the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen believes that relatively high unemployment in the United States and adverse economic
conditions in general have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, the
performance of its notes receivable portfolio in the form of relatively higher defaults and lower
prepayment rates than have historically been experienced. Bluegreen&#146;s estimates regarding its
allowance for loan losses involves interpretation of historical data, assumptions relative to the
impact of loan seasoning, prepayments and estimates of the effect of the higher default experience
over the past two years on remaining performance. To the extent that these estimates change,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">operations could be adversely affected. As a result of changes in
Bluegreen&#146;s estimates related to the future performance of loans originated prior to its
implementation of FICO&#174; score-based credit underwriting standards in December&nbsp;2008,
during 2010 Bluegreen recorded charges of $21.2&nbsp;million. Bluegreen anticipates that its
FICO&#174; score-based credit underwriting standards on new loan originations which were implemented in December&nbsp;2008 and
enhanced in January&nbsp;2010 and higher levels of customer equity in the existing loan portfolio will
have a favorable impact on the performance of the portfolio over time, although there is no
assurance that this will be the case. While Bluegreen believes its notes receivable are adequately
reserved at this time, there can be no assurance that future defaults will occur at expected
levels. If the future performance of its loans varies from Bluegreen&#146;s expectations and estimates,
additional charges may be required in the future.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen reviews financial information, allocates resources and manages its business as two
segments, Bluegreen Resorts and Bluegreen Communities. The information reviewed is based on
internal reports and excludes an allocation of general and administrative expenses attributable to
corporate overhead. The information provided is based on a managements approach and is used by us
for the purpose of tracking trends and changes in results. It does not reflect the actual economic

different basis of presentation or allocation were utilized, the relative contributions of the
segments might differ but the relative trends, in Bluegreen&#146;s view, would likely not be materially
impacted.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Sales of Real Estate. </I>Sales of Bluegreen Resorts real estate were $166.6&nbsp;million in
2010. Sales of Bluegreen Resorts real estate represent sales of Bluegreen owned VOIs, as adjusted
by changes in sales deferred under timeshare accounting rules, the impact of estimated
uncollectible VOI notes receivable and adjustment to allowance for loan losses described below.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales of Bluegreen-owned VOIs are impacted by the timing of when a sale meets the criteria for
revenue recognition. Sales of Bluegreen-owned VOIs that do not meet the revenue recognition
criteria as of the end of a period are deferred to a future period until such time as the revenue
recognition criteria are met. During 2010, due to timing of revenue recognition Bluegreen realized
a net recognition of approximately $0.8&nbsp;million of sales, due to the timing of revenue recognition.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VOI revenue is reduced by Bluegreen&#146;s estimate of future uncollectible VOI notes receivable.
Estimated losses for uncollectible VOI notes receivable vary with the amount of financed sales
during the period, and changes in Bluegreen&#146;s estimates of future note receivable performance for
newly originated loans and the future performance of its existing loan portfolio. During the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen reduced revenue by $24.4&nbsp;million for the estimated future
uncollectibles on loans originated in these periods.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, during 2010, Bluegreen recorded charges of $21.2&nbsp;million to increase its
allowance for uncollectible notes receivable in connection with the lower FICO&#174; score loans
generated prior to November&nbsp;1, 2008, the date at which Bluegreen implemented FICO&#174;
score-based credit standards. In connection with Bluegreen&#146;s analysis of loan performance
performed during 2010, Bluegreen concluded that these lower FICO&#174; score loans have not experienced
the same benefit of seasoning as other loans in the same vintage historically have, thus resulting
in the probability of higher future defaults on such loans. While Bluegreen believes its notes
receivable are adequately reserved at this time, there can be no assurance that defaults have
stabilized or that they will not increase.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales of Bluegreen Resorts real estate (prior to changes in sales deferred under timeshare
accounting rules, the impact of estimated uncollectible VOI notes receivable and adjustment to
allowance for loan losses described above) were $211.5&nbsp;million in 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Cost of Real Estate Sales. </I>Bluegreen Resorts&#146; cost of sales was $19.9&nbsp;million in 2010. Cost of
sales varies between periods based on the sales volumes, the relative costs of the specific VOIs
sold in each respective period and the size of the point packages of the VOIs sold. Additionally,
cost of sales during 2010 was impacted by the decrease in the overall carrying cost of Bluegreen&#146;s
VOI inventory due to the adoption of ASU 2009-16 and ASU 2009-17, effective January&nbsp;1, 2010. In
addition, the increase in Bluegreen&#146;s loan loss reserve during 2010 impacted Bluegreen&#146;s future
projected product margins, which decreased the carrying cost of inventory in accordance with
applicable timeshare accounting rules.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31 2010, Bluegreen sold $78.8&nbsp;million of third-party developer
inventory and earned sales and marketing commissions of $53.0&nbsp;million. Based on an allocation of
selling, marketing and segment general and administrative expenses to these sales, Bluegreen
believes it generated approximately $10.8&nbsp;million in pre-tax profits by providing these sales and
marketing fee-based services during the year ended December&nbsp;2010. Bluegreen anticipates that
fee-based services will be a greater portion of its revenues in the future, although there is no
assurance that this will be the case.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Selling and Marketing Expenses. </I>Selling and marketing expenses for Bluegreen Resorts were
$139.8&nbsp;million during 2010. Selling and marketing expenses in 2010 reflected expanded marketing
activity consistent with the increase in Bluegreen&#146;s system-wide sales of VOIs. As a percentage of
system-wide sales, net, selling and marketing expenses was 52% during 2010. Overall sale-to-tour
ratios decreased slightly during 2010 and sales to owners, which carry a relatively lower marketing
cost, accounted for 58% of system-wide sales during 2010.</DIV>

title services for VOI transactions. In exchange for fees, Bluegreen provides management services
to the Bluegreen Vacation Club and to a majority of the property owners&#146; associations of the Club
Resorts and Club Associate Resorts. In connection with Bluegreen&#146;s management services provided to
Bluegreen Vacation Club, Bluegreen manages the club reservation system, and provides owner services
as well as billing and collections services.</DIV>

related to other resort fee-based services in 2010 reflects additional fees earned by providing
services to more VOI owners and from managing more timeshare resorts on behalf of property owners&#146;
associations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen managed 41 timeshare resort properties and hotels.
Additionally, Bluegreen&#146;s revenues related to title services increased due to a reduction in its

million in 2010. The cost during 2010 includes additional service volumes as described above.
Additionally, the carrying costs of Bluegreen&#146;s VOI inventory includes maintenance fees and
developer subsidies on VOIs in Bluegreen-owned inventory, paid to the property owners&#146; associations
that maintain the resorts. Bluegreen partially mitigates this expense, to the extent possible,
through the rental of its owned VOIs. Accordingly, the net carrying cost of developer inventory
fluctuates with the number of VOIs Bluegreen holds and the number of resorts subject to developer
subsidy arrangements, as well as revenue realized from rental and sampler activity. During 2010,
the carrying cost of Bluegreen&#146;s developer inventory totaled approximately $20.5&nbsp;million and was
offset by rental and sampler revenues, net of expenses, of $11.9&nbsp;million during 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales at Bluegreen Communities have been, and continue to be, adversely impacted by the
weakening of the economy in general and the deterioration of the real estate markets, in
particular. Bluegreen has experienced continued low demand, especially for its higher priced
premium homesites. In response to the deterioration in the real estate markets and in order to
stay competitive in certain markets where its competitors have in certain communities aggressively
reduced prices, Bluegreen has significantly reduced prices on completed homesites. In addition,
during 2009, Bluegreen substantially sold out of certain of its communities, which also contributed
to the decrease in sales in 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;24, 2011, Bluegreen announced that it had engaged advisors to explore strategic
alternatives for Bluegreen Communities, including the possible sale of the division. There can be
no assurance regarding the timing or success these efforts, or that any such alternatives, if
pursued and ultimately consummated, will improve Bluegreen&#146;s financial condition and operating
results or otherwise achieve the benefits it may expect to result from the transaction. In the
event that adverse conditions in the real estate market continue or deteriorate further, the
carrying value of Bluegreen Communities&#146; inventory would be reevaluated and could result in
additional material impairment charges. Impairment charges may also be required to the extent that
additional market information obtained during the strategic review process indicates that the
carrying value of Bluegreen&#146;s Communities inventory exceeds its fair value.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen Communities&#146; sales during 2010 reflected the application of the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Excluding the impact of percentage-of-completion
method of accounting, Bluegreen Communities sales during 2010 decreased.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen Communities&#146; homesite inventory consists of substantially completed homesites held
for sale and land held for the future development of additional homesites. As a result of
Bluegreen&#146;s continued depressed sales volume, reduced prices, and the impact of current sales
levels on the forecasted sell-out period of its projects, during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010,
Bluegreen recorded non-cash charges to cost of real estate sales of approximately $14.9, net of
purchase accounting adjustments, to write-down the carrying amount of certain phases of its
properties to their estimated fair value, less costs to sell, if applicable. Bluegreen calculated
the estimated fair value less costs to sell of these properties based on its analysis of their
estimated future cash flows, discounted at rates commensurate with the inherent risk. Bluegreen
estimated future cash flows based upon what they believe to be market participants&#146;</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">expectations of
future performance, given current and projected forecasts of the economy and real estate markets in
general as well as the forecasted sell-out periods for each community. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010,
Bluegreen evaluated the carrying value of its Bluegreen Communities inventory (carrying value was
$78.2&nbsp;million, net of purchase accounting adjustments, as of December&nbsp;31, 2010) based upon the
probability-weighted average cash flows at various
outcomes, including to develop and sell such inventory as retail homesites or to execute on
various strategic alternatives which Bluegreen may pursue in the near term. Based on the sales
prices currently being realized on its homesites and forecasts of sales pace, Bluegreen believes
that its Bluegreen Communities&#146; inventory carrying value is appropriate. Should the adverse
conditions in the real estate markets where Bluegreen operates continue longer than forecasted or
deteriorate further, or if its performance does not otherwise meet Bluegreen&#146;s expectations, or
estimates change as they explore strategic alternatives, additional material charges may be
recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the inventory charges described above, during 2010, Bluegreen Communities&#146;
gross margins were negatively impacted by additional reductions in sales prices of certain
completed homesites. Variations in cost structures and the market pricing of homesites available
for sale as well as the opening of phases of projects, which include premium homesites (e.g., water
frontage, preferred views, larger acreage homesites, etc.), also impact the gross margin of
Bluegreen Communities from period to period.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other operations of Bluegreen Communities&#146; business historically included the operation of
several daily fee golf courses, as well as realty resale operations at several of our residential
land communities. On December&nbsp;30, 2009, Bluegreen sold four of its golf courses located in North
Carolina and Virginia and have reported the operating results of these golf courses as discontinued
operations. Bluegreen continues to own and operate two golf courses.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2010 Bluegreen continued to focus its marketing efforts on internet, billboards, and
regionally based advertising. While Bluegreen believes this focus will lead to an increase in
interest in its properties, Bluegreen continues to experience relatively lower sales conversion
rates. Bluegreen Communities&#146; total selling and marketing expenses during 2010 remained level with
the expenses incurred during 2009. As a percentage of sales, selling and marketing expenses were
39% during 2010 representing an increase over historical amounts. The increase in selling and
marketing expenses as a percentage of sales in 2010 is the result of lower sales in 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen Communities&#146; general and administrative expenses during 2010 included costs to
settle litigation and a higher proportion of real estate taxes being expensed as incurred rather
than capitalized into inventory due to reduced construction and development spending.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Finance Operations</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen&#146;s finance operations included the excess interest spread
earned on $668.4&nbsp;million of notes receivable. This amount reflects the consolidation on January&nbsp;1,
2010 of notes receivable held by special purpose finance entities that were previously not
consolidated by Bluegreen in accordance with then-prevailing generally accepted accounting
principles.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest income on notes receivable during 2010 reflects a higher average balance of
Bluegreen&#146;s vacation ownership notes receivable and to a lesser extent, higher interest rates
charged on timeshare loans originated after November&nbsp;1, 2008. As discussed above, the average
balances of Bluegreen&#146;s notes receivable increased during 2010 as a result of the consolidation of
notes receivable held by seven of Bluegreen&#146;s special purpose finance entities that were previously
reported &#147;off-balance-sheet.&#148; Accordingly, Bluegreen previously did not recognize interest income
on such notes receivable, but instead recognized interest income through the accretion of interest
on its retained interests in the notes held by these entities.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><I>Mortgage Servicing Operations. </I></U>Bluegreen&#146;s mortgage servicing operations include
processing payments, and collection of notes receivable owned by Bluegreen, as well as on notes
receivable owned by third parties. In addition, Bluegreen&#146;s mortgage servicing operations
facilitate the monetization of its VOI notes receivable through its various credit facilities, as
well as perform monthly reporting activities for Bluegreen&#146;s lenders and receivable investors.
Prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-16 and ASU 2009-17 on January&nbsp;1, 2010, Bluegreen recognized
servicing fee income for providing mortgage servicing for notes receivable that had been sold to
off-balance-sheet special purpose finance entities and for providing loan services to third-party
portfolio owners on a cash-fee basis. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2010, Bluegreen ceased recognizing
servicing fee income for providing mortgage servicing to its special purpose finance entities as
such entities are now consolidated by Bluegreen. While Bluegreen still receives mortgage servicing
fees for servicing its securitized notes receivable, these amounts are now accounted for as a
component of interest income.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2010, servicing fee income represented mortgage servicing fees earned for servicing the
loan portfolio of a third-party developer in connection with one of Bluegreen&#146;s fee-based services
arrangements. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, the total amount of notes receivable serviced by Bluegreen
under this arrangement was $23.8&nbsp;million.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><I>Interest Expense.</I></U> Interest expense on receivable-backed notes payable in
2010 reflects a higher average debt balance of additional non-recourse receivable-backed debt
recorded on Bluegreen&#146;s balance sheet as a result of the consolidation of seven special purpose
finance entities as of January&nbsp;1, 2010. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, the outstanding balance of the
non-recourse receivable-backed debt previously reported &#147;off-balance sheet&#148; was $328.6&nbsp;million.</DIV>

and notes payable and our subordinated debentures, was $22.6&nbsp;million during 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other interest expense during 2010 reflects a lower average debt balance as a result of the
repayment of Bluegreen&#146;s lines-of-credit and notes payable and lower interest rates on its junior
subordinated debentures, which was offset by higher interest rates on certain extensions to its existing debt agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen&#146;s effective cost of borrowing was 7.46% during 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion of Bluegreen&#146;s interest expense, which directly relates to interest on development spending,
is capitalized to construction in progress. Interest expense capitalized to construction in
progress varies based upon the amount of construction and development spending during the period.
Total interest expense capitalized to construction in progress was insignificant during 2010 due to
a significantly reduced level of construction and development spending during the period.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Corporate General and Administrative Expenses</I></B>. Bluegreen&#146;s corporate general and administrative
expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with administering the various support functions
at its corporate headquarters, including accounting, human resources, information technology,
treasury, and legal. Overall corporate and general administrative costs may fluctuate between
periods for various reasons, including but not limited to the timing of professional services and
litigation expenses. In addition, consistent with Bluegreen&#146;s segment reporting treatment, changes
in the payroll accrual between reporting periods for the entire company are recorded as corporate
general and administrative expense. Corporate general and administrative expenses, excluding
mortgage servicing operations, were $42.5&nbsp;million for 2010, which reflected lower litigation costs,
the benefit of higher than expected forfeitures on certain stock grants and lower company-wide
benefit costs.

attributable to Big Cedar, LLC, the unaffiliated 49% interest holder in the Subsidiary.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen&#146;s primary sources of funds from internal operations are: (i)&nbsp;cash sales, (ii)&nbsp;down
payments on homesite and VOI sales which are financed, (iii)&nbsp;proceeds from the sale of, or
borrowings collateralized by, notes receivable, including cash received from its residual interests
in such transactions, (iv)&nbsp;cash from finance operations, including principal and interest payments
received on the purchase money mortgage loans arising from sales of VOIs and homesites and mortgage
servicing fees, and (v)&nbsp;net cash generated from sales and marketing fee-based services and other
resort fee-based services, including its resorts management operations, and other communities
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales of VOIs accounted for 96% of Bluegreen&#146;s system-wide sales during 2010. As a result of
initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008, Bluegreen has in recent years realized
higher down payments and a higher percentage of cash sales in connection with VOI sales compared to
prior years. Including down payments received on financed sales, 54% of Bluegreen&#146;s VOI sales were
paid in cash within approximately 30&nbsp;days from the contract date.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the vacation ownership business has historically been capital intensive, Bluegreen&#146;s

associates to generate higher percentages of Bluegreen&#146;s sales in cash compared to historical
levels; ii) maintaining sales volumes that allow it to focus on what Bluegreen believes to be the
most efficient marketing channels available to it; iii) minimizing capital and inventory
expenditures; and iv) utilizing its sales and marketing, mortgage servicing, resort management
services, title and construction expertise to pursue fee-based-service business relationships that
require minimal up-front capital investment and have the potential to produce strong cash flows for
Bluegreen.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, Bluegreen&#146;s business model has depended on the availability of credit in the
commercial markets. VOI sales are generally dependent upon Bluegreen providing financing to its
buyers. Bluegreen&#146;s ability to sell and/or borrow against its notes receivable from VOI buyers is a
critical factor in its continued liquidity. When Bluegreen sells VOIs, a financed buyer is only
required to pay a minimum of 10% to 20% of the purchase price in cash at the time of sale; however,
selling, marketing, and administrative expenses attributable to the sale are primarily cash
expenses that generally exceed the buyer&#146;s minimum required down-payment. Accordingly, having
financing facilities available for the hypothecation, sale, or transfer of these vacation ownership
receivables is a critical factor in Bluegreen&#146;s ability to meet its short and long-term cash needs.
Historically, Bluegreen has relied on its ability to sell receivables in the term securitization
market in order to generate liquidity and create capacity in its receivable facilities. In
addition, maintaining adequate VOI inventory to sell and pursue growth into new markets has
historically required Bluegreen to incur debt for the acquisition, construction and development of
new resorts. Although Bluegreen believes that it currently has adequate completed VOIs in
inventory to satisfy its needs for the next several years, and therefore, expect acquisition and
development expenditures to remain at current levels in the near future, Bluegreen may decide to
acquire or develop more inventory in the future, which would increase its acquisition and
development expenditures and may require it to incur additional debt.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2010, Bluegreen successfully renewed and extended several of its existing credit
facilities. Bluegreen also entered into a $20.0&nbsp;million timeshare receivables hypothecation
facility with National Bank of Arizona and a $20.0&nbsp;million timeshare receivables purchase facility
with Quorum Federal Credit Union. Additionally, Bluegreen successfully completed two
securitization transactions. In September of 2010, Bluegreen securitized $36.1&nbsp;million of the
lowest FICO&#174; score loans previously financed by the BB&#038;T purchase facility for gross proceeds of
$24.3&nbsp;million and in December of 2010, Bluegreen securitized an additional $126.2&nbsp;million of its
higher-FICO&#174; score loans for gross proceeds of $107.6&nbsp;million, a portion of which was used to repay
all amounts then outstanding under the Company&#146;s existing receivables purchase facility with BB&#038;T.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenging credit markets have negatively impacted Bluegreen&#146;s financing activities in
recent years compared to historical levels. While the credit markets appear to be recovering and
Bluegreen consummated term securitizations and entered into new financing facilities during 2010,
the number of banks and other finance companies in the market which provide &#147;warehouse&#148; lines of
credit for timeshare receivables has decreased. There is no assurance that Bluegreen will be able
to renew its existing receivable-backed lines of credit when their current advance periods expire
or secure new future financing for its VOI notes receivable on acceptable terms, if at all. In
addition, the securitization market has become unavailable for extended periods of time in the past
and there can be no assurances that it will not become unavailable to Bluegreen in the future.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, while Bluegreen may seek to raise additional debt or equity financing in the future
to fund operations or repay outstanding debt, there is no assurance that such financing will be
available to Bluegreen on favorable terms or at all. If Bluegreen&#146;s efforts are unsuccessful, its
liquidity would be significantly adversely impacted. In light of the current trading price of
Bluegreen&#146;s common stock, financing involving the issuance of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock or
securities convertible into its common stock would be highly dilutive to Bluegreen&#146;s existing
shareholders.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen&#146;s levels of debt and debt service requirements have several important effects on its
operations, including the following: (i)&nbsp;Bluegreen&#146;s significant cash requirements to service debt
reduces the funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increases its
vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, as well as conditions in the credit
markets, generally; (ii)&nbsp;Bluegreen&#146;s leverage position increases its vulnerability to economic and
competitive pressures; (iii)&nbsp;the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in
indentures, credit agreements and other agreements relating to Bluegreen&#146;s indebtedness requires
Bluegreen to meet certain financial tests and restrict its ability to, among other things, borrow
additional funds, dispose of assets, make investments, or pay cash dividends on or repurchase
common stock; and (iv)&nbsp;Bluegreen&#146;s leverage position may limit funds available for working capital,
capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes. Certain of Bluegreen&#146;s
financing arrangements materially limit its ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock or
its ability to repurchase shares in</DIV>

facility with Branch Banking and Trust Company (&#147;BB&#038;T&#148;) (the &#147;BB&#038;T Purchase Facility&#148;). The BB&#038;T
Purchase Facility provides a revolving advance period through December&nbsp;17, 2011. The interest
rates on future advances under the facility are the Prime Rate plus 2.0%, subject to tiered
increases once the outstanding balance equals or exceeds $25.0&nbsp;million, subject to a maximum
interest rate of the Prime Rate plus 3.5%, once the facility equals or exceeds $50.0&nbsp;million.
Additionally, Bluegreen receive all of the excess cash flows generated by the timeshare receivables
transferred to BB&#038;T under the facility (excess meaning after customary payment of fees, interest
and principal under the facility). The BB&#038;T Purchase Facility provides for the financing of its
timeshare receivables at an advance rate of 67.5%, subject to the terms of the facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While ownership of the receivables is transferred for legal purposes, the transfers of
receivables under the facility are accounted for as secured borrowings. Accordingly, the
receivables are reflected as assets and the associated obligations are reflected as liabilities on
Bluegreen&#146;s balance sheet. The BB&#038;T Purchase Facility is nonrecourse and is not guaranteed by us.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, the entire $75.0&nbsp;million facility was available to be drawn upon,

facility (the &#147;Quorum Facility&#148;) with Quorum Federal Credit Union (&#147;Quorum&#148;). The Quorum Facility
allows for the sale of timeshare notes receivable on a non-recourse basis, pursuant to the terms of
the facility and subject to certain conditions precedent. Quorum has agreed to purchase eligible
timeshare receivables or certain of its subsidiaries up to an aggregate $20.0&nbsp;million purchase
price through December&nbsp;22, 2011. The terms of the Quorum Facility reflect an 80% advance rate and
at a program fee rate of 8% per annum through August&nbsp;31, 2001, and at terms to be agreed upon
through December&nbsp;22, 2011. Eligibility requirements for receivables sold include, amongst others,
that the obligors under the timeshare notes receivable sold be members of Quorum at the time of the
note sale. The Quorum Facility contemplates the ability of Quorum to purchase additional
receivables subject to advance rates, fees and other terms to be agreed upon from time to time over
and above the initial $20.0&nbsp;million commitment, pursuant to the terms of the facility and subject
to certain conditions precedent. Bluegreen will receive all of the excess cash flows generated by
the receivables transferred to Quorum under the facility (excess meaning after customary payment of
fees and return of amounts invested by Quorum under the facility on a pro-rata basis as borrowers
make payments on their timeshare loans).</DIV>

timeshare receivables hypothecation facility with a syndicate of lenders led by Liberty Bank and
assembled by Wellington Financial (&#147;Liberty Bank Facility&#148;). During 2010, Bluegreen pledged $27.6
million of VOI notes receivable to this facility and received cash proceeds of $27.4&nbsp;million.
Bluegreen also repaid $18.9&nbsp;million on the facility. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen had no
availability under the facility as the revolving advance period has expired.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February of 2011, Bluegreen revised the terms of and extended the Liberty Bank Facility.
The revised $60.0&nbsp;million facility (&#147;New Liberty Bank Facility&#148;) provides for an 85% advance on
eligible receivables pledged under the facility during a two-year period ending in February&nbsp;2013,
subject to terms and conditions Bluegreen believes to be customary for transactions of this type.
Availability under the New Liberty Bank Facility is reduced by amounts currently outstanding to
certain syndicate participants under the existing Liberty Bank Facility. At February&nbsp;28, 2011, the
time of the transaction, such currently outstanding amounts under the existing Liberty Bank
Facility were approximately $47.0&nbsp;million, therefore, initial availability under the New Liberty
Bank Facility was approximately $13.0&nbsp;million, but as outstanding amounts on the existing facility
amortize over time, the New Liberty Bank Facility will revolve up to $60.0&nbsp;million, subject to
eligible collateral and customary terms and conditions. Principal and interest will be paid as cash
is collected on the pledged receivables, with the remaining balance due in February&nbsp;2016.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indebtedness under the New Liberty Bank Facility bears interest at the Prime Rate plus 2.25%,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the significant non-cash charges associated with loan loss reserves and
Communities&#146; inventory impairments as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen would have been in violation
of one of the original net worth covenants under the Liberty Bank Facility as of that date.
However, in March&nbsp;2011, Liberty Bank confirmed that the covenants contained in
the New Liberty Bank Facility superseded the
covenants contained in the original facility. Bluegreen was in compliance with all
applicable covenants as of December&nbsp;31, 2010.</DIV>

the lowest FICO&#174;-score loans previously financed in the BB&#038;T Purchase Facility. Substantially all
of the timeshare receivables included in this transaction were generated prior to November&nbsp;1, 2008,
the date that Bluegreen implemented its FICO&#174; score-based credit underwriting program, and had
FICO&#174; scores below 600.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this securitization, BXG Legacy 2010 LLC, a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary of
Bluegreen, issued $27.0&nbsp;million of notes payable secured by a portfolio of timeshare receivables
totaling $36.1&nbsp;million. While the notes payable have a coupon rate of 12%, they were sold at a $2.7
million discount to yield an effective rate of 18.5%. The notes payable generated gross proceeds to
Bluegreen of $24.3&nbsp;million (before fees and reserves and expenses believed to be customary for
transactions of this type), which was used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under the
BB&#038;T Purchase Facility.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen guaranteed the principal payments for defaulted vacation ownership loans in the
Legacy Securitization at amounts equivalent to the then-current advance rate inherent in the notes,
any shortfalls in monthly interest distributions to the Legacy Securitization investors and any
shortfall in the ultimate principal payment on the notes upon their stated maturity in September
2025. During 2010, Bluegreen repaid $1.7&nbsp;million of the outstanding balance on the Legacy
Securitization notes payable.</DIV>

Bluegreen Corporation has guaranteed the full payment and performance of Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint
Venture in connection with this facility. The facility provides for an 85% advance on $23.5&nbsp;million
of eligible receivables, all of which were pledged under the facility at closing, subject to terms
and conditions which Bluegreen believes to be customary for facilities of this type. All principal

$27.3&nbsp;million of which is due by October&nbsp;31, 2011. The maturity date for the project loan
collateralized by Bluegreen&#146;s Fountains resort in Orlando, Florida (the &#147;Fountains Loan&#148;) is March
31, 2011. Approximately $2.4&nbsp;million was outstanding on this loan as of December&nbsp;31, 2010.
Principal payments are effected through agreed-upon release prices as timeshare interests in the
resorts collateralizing the RFA AD&#038;C Facility are sold, subject to periodic minimum required
amortization on the Club 36 Loan and the Fountains Loans. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen had
no availability under this facility. During 2010, Bluegreen repaid $35.2&nbsp;million of the
outstanding balance under this facility.</DIV>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;28, 2009, Bluegreen entered into an amendment to the Textron AD&#038;C Facility and a
sub-loan under the Facility used to fund the acquisition and development of our Odyssey Dells Resort (the
&#147;Odyssey Sub-Loan&#148;). The amendment to the Odyssey Sub-Loan extended the final maturity of
outstanding borrowings under the Odyssey Sub-Loan to December&nbsp;31, 2011, and revised the periodic
minimum required principal amortization. As amended, Bluegreen&#146;s minimum required principal
payments are $1.0&nbsp;million per quarter through maturity. Bluegreen pays Textron principal payments
as we sell timeshare interests that collateralize the Odyssey Sub-Loan, subject to periodic minimum
required principal amortization. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen&#146;s outstanding borrowings under
the Sub-Loan totaled approximately $3.6&nbsp;million.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sub-loan used to acquire Bluegreen&#146;s Atlantic Palace Resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey
was $5.7&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 (the &#147;Atlantic Palace Sub-Loan&#148;). Bluegreen pays Textron
principal payments as it sells timeshare interests that collateralize the Atlantic Palace Sub-Loan,
subject to periodic minimum required principal amortization. The final maturity of outstanding
borrowings under the Atlantic Palace Sub-Loan is April&nbsp;2013.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen guaranteed all sub-loans under the Textron AD&#038;C Facility. Interest on the Textron
AD&#038;C Facility is equal to the Prime Rate plus 1.25% &#151; 1.50% and is due monthly. During 2010,
Bluegreen repaid $3.5&nbsp;million under this facility.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Wells Fargo Term Loan. </I>On April&nbsp;30, 2010, Bluegreen entered into a definitive agreement with
Wells Fargo, which amended, restated and consolidated its then existing notes payable and
line-of-credit issued with Wachovia Bank, N.A. into a single term loan with Wells Fargo (the &#147;Wells
Fargo Term Loan&#148;). The notes payable and line-of-credit which were consolidated into the Wells
Fargo Term Loan had a total outstanding balance of $36.4&nbsp;million as of April&nbsp;30, 2010. In
connection with the closing of the Wells Fargo Term Loan, Bluegreen made a principal payment of
$0.4&nbsp;million, reducing the balance to $36.0&nbsp;million, and paid accrued interest on the then-existing
Wachovia debt. Principal payments are effected through agreed-upon release prices as real estate
collateralizing the Wells Fargo Term Loan is sold, subject to minimum remaining required
amortization as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, of $10.6&nbsp;million in 2011 and $20.2&nbsp;million in 2012. In
addition to the resort projects previously pledged as collateral for the various notes payable to
Wachovia, Bluegreen pledged additional timeshare interests, resorts real estate, and the residual
interests in certain of its sold VOI notes receivable as collateral for the Wells Fargo Term Loan.
As required by the terms of the Wells Fargo Term Loan, Wells Fargo received, as additional
collateral, the residual interest in the 2010 Term Securitization. The Wells Fargo Term Loan bears
interest at the 30-day LIBOR plus 6.87% (7.13% as of December&nbsp;31, 2010).</DIV>

approximately $6.0 million as of
December&nbsp;31, 2010. Bluegreen estimates that the cash required to satisfy its development obligations related to Communities was approximately $5.0&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010. These amounts assume
that Bluegreen is not obligated to develop any building, project or amenity in which a commitment
has not been made pursuant to a sales contract with a customer; however, Bluegreen anticipates that
it will incur such obligations in the future. Bluegreen plans to fund these expenditures over the
next three to ten years, primarily with cash generated from operations. There is no assurance that
Bluegreen will be able to generate the cash from operations necessary to complete these commitments
or that actual costs will not exceed the amounts estimated.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen believes that its existing cash, anticipated cash generated from operations,
anticipated future permitted borrowings under existing or proposed credit facilities and
anticipated future sales of notes receivable under the purchase facilities and one or more
replacement facilities Bluegreen intends to put in place will be sufficient to meet its anticipated
working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements, including the contractual
payment obligations set forth above, for the foreseeable future, subject to the successful
implementation of ongoing strategic initiatives and receivable-backed credit facility extensions
discussed above and the ongoing availability of credit. Bluegreen will continue its efforts to
renew, extend or replace any credit and receivables purchase facilities that have expired or that
will expire in the near term. Bluegreen may, in the future, also obtain additional credit
facilities and may issue corporate debt or equity securities. Any debt incurred or issued by
Bluegreen may be secured or unsecured, bear fixed or variable rate interest and may be subject to
such terms as the lender may require and management believes acceptable. There can be no assurance
that the credit facilities or receivables purchase facilities which have expired or which are
scheduled to expire in the near term will be renewed or replaced or that sufficient funds will be
available from operations or under existing, proposed or future revolving credit or other borrowing
arrangements or receivables purchase facilities to meet Bluegreen&#146;s cash needs, including its debt
service obligations. To the extent Bluegreen is not able to sell notes receivable or borrow under
such facilities, its ability to satisfy its obligations would be materially adversely affected.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen&#146;s credit facilities, indentures, and other outstanding debt instruments, and
receivables purchase facilities include what Bluegreen believes to be customary conditions to
funding, eligibility requirements for collateral, cross-default and other acceleration provisions,
certain financial and other affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, limits on
the incurrence of indebtedness, the repurchase of securities, payment of dividends, investments in
joint ventures and other restricted payments, the incurrence of liens, and transactions with
affiliates, as well as covenants concerning net worth, fixed charge coverage requirements,
debt-to-equity ratios, portfolio performance requirements, cash balances and events of default or
termination. No assurance can be given that Bluegreen will not be required to seek waivers of such
covenants, that Bluegreen will be successful in obtaining waivers, or that such covenants will not
limit Bluegreen&#146;s ability to raise funds, sell receivables, satisfy or refinance our obligations or
otherwise adversely affect its operations. Further, although Bluegreen does not currently believe
that any such transactions currently are, or are likely to be, structured so as to materially limit
its ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock or its ability to repurchase shares in the
near term, there is no assurance this will remain true in the future. In addition, Bluegreen&#146;s
future operating performance and ability to meet its financial obligations will be subject to
future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which will be
beyond Bluegreen&#146;s control.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>For the Year Ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 as Compared to 2009</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in BankAtlantic&#146;s net loss during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to
the same 2009 period resulted primarily from a $75.4&nbsp;million decrease in the provision for loan
losses and $22.5&nbsp;million of lower non-interest expenses, partially offset by $12.0&nbsp;million and $23.5
million of decreased net interest income and non-interest income, respectively.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial decrease in the provision for loan losses related primarily to a reduction in
charge-offs, lower commercial real estate loan balances, and lower real estate value declines. We
believe that the reduction in the provision for loan losses reflects significant real estate loan
write-downs in prior periods. However, if economic and real estate market conditions deteriorate
further, particularly in Florida, we believe that higher provisions for loan losses may be required
in future periods.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decreased non-interest income was due primarily to lower revenues from service charges
reflecting declines in the total number of accounts which incurred overdraft fees and a decrease in
the frequency of overdrafts per deposit account. We believe that the decline in the number of
accounts incurring overdraft fees is the result of our focus on seeking to attract customers who
maintain deposit accounts with higher balances, the adoption of new Federal Reserve overdraft
rules, other modifications to our overdraft policies and changes in customer behavior. We
currently expect this decline in overdraft fees to continue as we have introduced new fee based
deposit products and revised our overdraft protection products and practices in a manner that will
likely result in lower fees.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in BankAtlantic&#146;s net interest income resulted primarily from lower earning asset
balances and higher non-performing asset balances as well as an increase in lower yielding interest
bearing cash balances with the Federal Reserve Bank and other lower yielding investments reflecting
management&#146;s decision to increase liquidity. The decline in earning assets was the result of lower
loan originations and purchases, reduced acquisitions of tax certificates and sales of agency
securities.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in non-interest expenses reflects lower compensation and occupancy expenses
associated with efforts to increase operating efficiencies and $7.5&nbsp;million of costs associated
with debt redemptions in 2009 compared to $60,000 of costs associated with debt redemptions in
2010. The lower non-interest expenses were partially offset by higher professional fees associated
primarily with the class-action securities litigation and secondarily from legal costs associated
with the regulatory environment, tax certificate activities litigation, loan modifications and loan
work-outs.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, non-interest expenses included $4.5&nbsp;million of
impairments on assets transferred to held-for-sale in connection with the Tampa branch sale, $4.0
million of employee severance</DIV>

$3.3&nbsp;million of real estate impairments and lease termination costs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in the Parent Company&#146;s loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to the
same 2009 period resulted primarily from a $12.9&nbsp;million decline in the provision for loan losses
and lower compensation expenses partially offset by higher professional fees. The substantial
improvement in the provision for loan losses reflects lower loan balances from loan sales, short
sales and charge-offs. Loan receivable balances declined from $48.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009 to
$17.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010. The decline in compensation expense reflects substantially
lower executive bonuses during 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in professional fees resulted
from higher consulting costs associated with investment banking and advisory services as well as
increased legal expenses incurred in connection with the SEC investigation, regulatory environment,
general corporate matters and foreclosure costs associated with non-performing loans held in a
work-out subsidiary of the Parent Company.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>For the Year Ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 as Compared to 2008</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower loss from continuing operations at BankAtlantic during 2009 compared to the same
2008 period was primarily the result of a $31.7&nbsp;million income tax benefit recognized by
BankAtlantic during 2009 in connection with a change in tax regulations which enabled BankAtlantic
to utilize additional net operating losses. During 2008, BankAtlantic established a deferred tax
valuation allowance on the entire amount of net deferred tax assets resulting in a tax provision of
$31.1&nbsp;million. BankAtlantic&#146;s 2009 loss before income taxes increased by $45.4&nbsp;million compared to
2008. The higher 2009 loss primarily resulted from a $78.9&nbsp;million increase in the provision for
loan losses, a $30.3&nbsp;million reduction in net interest income and $8.0&nbsp;million of lower
non-interest income. The increase in BankAtlantic&#146;s loss before income taxes was partially offset
by $71.8&nbsp;million of lower non-interest expenses. The substantial increase in the provision for
loan losses resulted primarily from a significant increase in charge-offs and loan loss reserves in
our consumer, residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction in BankAtlantic&#146;s net interest income was primarily due to a decline in earning
assets. The reduction in non-interest income related primarily to a decline in overdraft fees.
This overdraft fee income decline reflected, in part, management&#146;s focus on targeting retail
customers and businesses that maintain higher average deposit balances which generally will result
in fewer overdrafts per account. BankAtlantic, during 2009, continued to reduce expenses with a
view towards increasing operating efficiencies. These operating expense initiatives included
workforce reductions, consolidation of certain back-office facilities, renegotiation of vendor
contracts, outsourcing of certain back-office functions, reduction in marketing expenses and other
targeted expense reductions. Also, restructuring charges and other impairments declined by $33.0
million. These expense reductions were partially offset by $8.2&nbsp;million of additional FDIC
insurance premiums, including a $2.4&nbsp;million FDIC special assessment in June&nbsp;2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in the Parent Company segment loss during 2009 compared to 2008 reflected a $6.0
million reduction in the provision for loan losses and $4.9&nbsp;million of reduced net interest
expense. The provision for loan losses for both years was associated with non-performing loans
acquired from BankAtlantic in March&nbsp;2008. The 2009 provision for loan losses represented
additional charge-offs and specific reserves associated with these loans due to declining real
estate collateral values. The improvement in net interest expense reflected historically low LIBOR
interest rates during 2009. The majority of the Parent Company&#146;s debt is indexed to the three-month
LIBOR interest rate. The decline in interest rates was partially offset by interest accrued on the
junior subordinated debentures deferred interest. Parent Company operating expenses were higher by
$0.3&nbsp;million during 2009 compared to 2008. Lower property management costs associated with
non-performing loans during 2009 were offset by higher compensation expenses.

respectively, in discontinued operations relating to additional proceeds received in connection
with contingent earn-out payments under the Ryan Beck merger agreement with Stifel.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2002, BankAtlantic launched its &#147;<I>Florida&#146;s Most Convenient Bank&#148; </I>initiative
which resulted in significant demand deposit, NOW checking and savings account growth (we refer to
these accounts as &#147;core deposit&#148; accounts) and subsequently this initiative contributed to a
significant increase in core deposit balances from $600&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2001 to
approximately $2.8&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2010. Core deposits represented 73% of BankAtlantic&#146;s
total deposits at December&nbsp;31, 2010, compared to 26% of total deposits at December&nbsp;31, 2001.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, BankAtlantic announced its de novo store expansion strategy and opened 32 stores as
of December&nbsp;31, 2008 in connection with this strategy. BankAtlantic&#146;s non-interest expenses
substantially increased as a result of the hiring of additional personnel, increased marketing to
support new stores, increased leasing and operating costs for the new stores and expenditures for
back-office technologies to support a larger institution.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2005, the growth in core deposits slowed reflecting rising
short-term interest rates and increased competition among financial institutions. In response to
these market conditions, BankAtlantic significantly increased its marketing expenditures and
continued its new store expansion program in an effort to sustain core deposit growth. The number
of new core deposit accounts opened increased from 226,000 during 2005 to 270,000 during 2006,
while core deposit balances grew to $2.2&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2006 from $2.1&nbsp;billion at
December&nbsp;31, 2005. In response to adverse economic conditions and the slowed deposit growth,
BankAtlantic significantly reduced its marketing expenditures beginning during the fourth quarter
of 2006 as part of an overall effort to reduce its non-interest expenses.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2007, BankAtlantic decided to delay its retail network
expansion, consolidate certain back-office facilities and implement other initiatives to reduce
non-interest expenses.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the latter half of 2007, the real estate markets deteriorated rapidly throughout the
United States, and particularly in Florida where BankAtlantic&#146;s commercial and consumer real
estate loans are concentrated. In response to these market conditions, BankAtlantic significantly
increased its allowance for loan losses for commercial loans collateralized by real estate and to
a lesser extent home equity consumer loans.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As economic conditions deteriorated in late 2007 and during 2008, real estate property values
continued to decline. The adverse economic and real estate market conditions severely impacted the
credit quality of BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolio. In March&nbsp;2008, the Parent Company purchased
$101.5&nbsp;million of non-performing loans from BankAtlantic and during the year contributed $65
million of capital to BankAtlantic. During the fourth quarter of 2008, financial and credit
markets experienced further rapid deterioration, investor confidence in financial institutions was
significantly and adversely affected, and the market capitalization of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock declined significantly. As BankAtlantic&#146;s non-performing loans increased, additional
loan loss reserves were established, impairments of long-lived assets were recognized and earnings
were adversely affected. As a consequence of the substantial losses during 2007 and 2008, the
deterioration in the price of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and the unprecedented economic
and market uncertainty, BankAtlantic recognized a $48.3&nbsp;million non-cash goodwill impairment
charge and established a $66.9&nbsp;million non-cash deferred tax valuation allowance.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2009, in response to the continued deteriorating economic conditions, including
continued falling real estate collateral values and rising unemployment, and the significant
adverse impact on the credit quality of our assets and our results of operations, BankAtlantic
reduced its assets, repaid its wholesale borrowings and increased core deposits with a view toward
strengthening its liquidity and regulatory capital ratios. However, the credit quality of its
loans continued to deteriorate in 2009, and BankAtlantic&#146;s losses continued. As a result, the
Company contributed an additional $105&nbsp;million of capital to BankAtlantic. Additionally, as a
consequence of the adverse economic environment, an additional $22.5&nbsp;million of restructuring
charges and asset impairments were recognized during 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2010, BankAtlantic continued to reduce its expenses and assets in order to improve its
liquidity and capital ratios. The Company contributed $28&nbsp;million of capital to BankAtlantic. As a
consequence of these actions, BankAtlantic was successful in enhancing its liquidity and
maintaining its required regulatory capital levels throughout 2010 despite incurring losses during
2010. During the third quarter of 2010, BankAtlantic began seeking a buyer for its Tampa branches
in order to focus on its core markets in southeast Florida. In January&nbsp;2011, BankAtlantic entered
into

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>For the Year Ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 as Compared to 2009</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in net interest income primarily resulted from a significant reduction in earning
assets and secondarily from an increase in non-performing assets partially offset by an improvement
in the net interest margin.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average balance of earning assets declined by $604.3&nbsp;million during year ended December
31, 2010 compared to the same 2009 period. This decline in interest earning assets significantly
reduced our net interest income. The decline in average earning assets reflects a management
decision to slow the origination and purchase of loans, sell agency securities and reduce the
purchase of tax certificates in an effort to enhance liquidity and improve regulatory capital
ratios. BankAtlantic also experienced significant residential loan and mortgage backed securities
repayments due to normal loan amortization as well as a significant amount of loan refinancing
associated with low residential mortgage interest rates during 2009 and 2010. These repayments
during 2010 resulted in significant increases in cash which was used, in part, for the purchase of
short-term investments and increased interest earning cash balances at the Federal Reserve Bank.
The average balances of these short-term investments and Federal Reserve balances were $338.7
million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to $45.7&nbsp;million for 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net interest spread and margin improved due to a decline in the cost of funds. The
decline resulted primarily from a change in our funding mix and secondarily from a decline in
deposit interest rates in the industry. BankAtlantic used a portion of the funds from the reduction
in assets to repay FHLB advances and short term wholesale borrowings. As a consequence,
BankAtlantic&#146;s funding mix changed from higher rate FHLB advances and short-term borrowings to
lower rate deposits. The decline in interest bearing deposit rates reflects the lower interest
rate environment and a change in the deposit funding mix from time deposits to NOW deposit
accounts. Time deposits generally have higher interest rates than NOW accounts. Deposits which
BankAtlantic receives in connection with its participation in the Certificate of Deposit Account
Registry Services (&#147;CDARS&#148;) program from other participating CDARS institutions are included in
BankAtlantic&#146;s financial statements as brokered deposits. Average brokered deposits declined from
$189.5&nbsp;million during 2009 to $23.8&nbsp;million, of which $18.8&nbsp;million of the 2010 brokered deposits
were CDARS related deposits. BankAtlantic ceased originating brokered deposits during 2009 and is
restricted under the Bank Order from origination or renewing brokered deposits in subsequent
periods.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improved cost of funds was partially offset by lower interest earning asset yields
primarily due to the change in the mix of earning assets as proceeds from the repayment of loans
were reinvested in lower yielding short-term investments. Also contributing to the decline in loan
receivable average yields was a significant increase in non-performing loans. Non-performing loans
were $371.0&nbsp;million, $286.1&nbsp;million and $208.1&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low interest rates during 2010 had a favorable impact on our net interest margin.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>For the Year Ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 as Compared to 2008</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in net interest income primarily resulted from a significant reduction in earning
assets and an increase in non-performing assets partially offset by an improvement in the net
interest spread.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in average earning assets reflects a management decision to reduce assets in order
to improve liquidity and regulatory capital ratios. As a consequence, average loans during 2009
declined by $344.4&nbsp;million compared to 2008 with $295.5&nbsp;million of the average loan decline
associated with the purchased residential loan portfolio. BankAtlantic experienced significant
residential loan repayments due to the large volume of loan refinancing associated with
historically low residential mortgage interest rates during 2009. During 2009, BankAtlantic
reduced the purchase of tax certificates from $368.4&nbsp;million during 2008 to $65.7&nbsp;million during
2009 and sold $284&nbsp;million of mortgage-backed securities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net interest spread improved due to a change in our funding mix. BankAtlantic used the
funds from deposit growth and the reduction in assets to repay FHLB advances and short term
wholesale borrowings. The interest earning asset yield declines were primarily due to lower
interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008, changes in the earning asset portfolio mix and a
significant increase in non-performing loans. The lower interest rate environment during 2009
compared to 2008 had a significant impact on commercial, small business and consumer loan yields,
as a majority of these loans have adjustable interest rates indexed to prime or LIBOR. The average
prime interest rate declined from 8.05% at December&nbsp;31, 2007 to 3.25% at December&nbsp;31, 2009, and the
average three-month LIBOR</DIV>

Additionally, average earning loan yields were adversely affected by a significant increase in
non-performing loans.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in interest bearing deposit rates reflects the lower interest rate environment and
an increase in NOW deposit accounts. The increase in certificate accounts reflects higher average
brokered deposit account balances during 2009 compared to 2008. Deposits which BankAtlantic

institutions are included in BankAtlantic&#146;s financial statements as brokered deposits. Average
brokered deposits increased from $81.5&nbsp;million during 2008 to $189.5&nbsp;million during 2009, of which
approximately 45% of average brokered deposits during 2009 consisted of CDARS related deposits.

BankAtlantic prepaid $692&nbsp;million of FHLB advances during the fourth quarter of 2008. BankAtlantic
funded the advance repayments with short term borrowings that were at significantly lower interest
rates than the repaid advances.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in net interest income during 2010 was due primarily to the decline in
average earning assets and a reduction in average yields on earning assets partially offset by
lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities. Average earning assets declined by $604.3&nbsp;million,
reducing net interest income by $47.0&nbsp;million. Average interest-bearing liabilities declined by
$659.6&nbsp;million, reducing interest expense by $35.0&nbsp;million. Average interest-bearing liabilities
declined more than average earnings assets due to an increase in non-interest bearing demand
deposits of $93.2&nbsp;million. The lower yields on total earning assets reduced interest income by
$20.7&nbsp;million while declines in interest rates on total interest bearing liabilities reduced
interest expense by $24.4&nbsp;million. As discussed above, the lower yields on interest earning assets
reflect the declining interest rate environment as well as the funds obtained from the repayment of
higher yielding securities and loans being reinvested in lower yielding short term investments. The
lower rates on interest bearing liabilities reflect the maturity and prepayments of higher rate
FHLB advances and other wholesale borrowings funded by the reduction in interest earning assets,
and the lower interest rates on deposits due to industry trends.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in net interest income during 2009 was primarily due to the decline in
average earning assets and secondarily due to the decline in average yields on earning assets.
Average earning assets declined by $765.6&nbsp;million, reducing net interest income by $90.2&nbsp;million.
Average interest-bearing liabilities declined by $781.8&nbsp;million, reducing interest expense by $59.9
million. The lower yields on total earning assets reduced interest income by $53.8&nbsp;million while
declines in interest rates on total interest bearing liabilities reduced interest expense by $36.8
million. As discussed above, the lower yields on interest earning assets reflect the effect of the
significant decline during 2009 of LIBOR and prime interest rate indices on the interest rates on
our loans in our portfolio.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in the provision for loan losses during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 as
compared to 2009 reflects lower charge-offs, declines in loan balances and what we believe are
indicators of slowing declines in property values during 2010 compared to 2009. The year-over-year
increases in the provision for loan losses and charge-offs for 2007, 2008 and 2009 compared to the
prior periods resulted primarily from the rapid decline in real estate values nationally, and in
Florida, and the substantial downturn in the homebuilding industry coupled with the deteriorating
economic environment that began in 2007. BankAtlantic has a high concentration of commercial
borrowers in the homebuilding industry and the majority of its residential and consumer home equity
loans are to retail customers. The ability of these retail customers to repay their loans is
adversely affected by rising unemployment rates. In December&nbsp;2009, the national unemployment rate
rose to almost 10% and the Florida unemployment rate increased from 4.1% at December&nbsp;31, 2007 to
7.6% at December&nbsp;31, 2008, and stood at 11.8% at December&nbsp;31, 2009. The Florida and national
unemployment rates were 11.7% and 9.4%, respectively, at December&nbsp;31, 2010. Rising national
unemployment has resulted in higher delinquencies and foreclosures on residential real estate
loans, including the jumbo residential loans which comprise the majority of our residential loan
portfolio. We believe the stabilizing of the unemployment rate and the relative slowing of the
rate of property value declines resulted in lower charge-offs and provisions for loan losses

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">during 2010 compared to 2009. However, we believe that if real estate and general
economic conditions and
unemployment trends in Florida do not improve, the credit quality of our loan portfolio will
continue to deteriorate, and we would expect an increase in loan delinquencies and non-accrual loan
balances as well as additional provisions for loan losses in future periods. Additionally, if
jumbo residential loan delinquencies and foreclosures continue to increase nationwide, additional
provisions for losses in our residential loan portfolio may be required.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continued to incur losses in our commercial residential real estate and consumer home
equity loan portfolios. We also began experiencing higher losses during 2009 and 2010 in our
commercial non-residential, residential and small business loan portfolios as the deteriorating
economic environment has adversely impacted these borrowers. In response to these trends, we
significantly reduced purchases of residential loans and tightened consumer home equity loan
underwriting requirements for new loans and froze certain borrowers&#146; home equity loan commitments
where borrowers&#146; current credit scores were significantly lower than at the date of loan
origination or where current collateral values were substantially lower than at loan origination.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that high unemployment and declining real estate values adversely impacted
charge-off trends of commercial real estate, consumer home equity and residential loans.
Commercial real estate loan charge-offs during 2010 and 2009 resulted primarily from our
commercial residential development loans. The majority of the commercial residential loan
charge-offs during 2010 and 2009 were from updated loan collateral fair value estimates reflecting
the continued deterioration in the Florida residential real estate market. We are hopeful that
charge-offs and non-performing commercial residential loans may have peaked and may decline in
future periods due to significant reductions in outstanding balances from December&nbsp;2008 to
December&nbsp;2010; however, this may not be the case, and we may experience the same or higher levels
of charge-offs and non-accrual loans in this category. With respect to commercial nonresidential
loans and small business loans, we expect that any impact on charge-offs in these loan categories
will depend in large part on the Florida economy. However, if market conditions do not improve or
deteriorate further, we would expect additional credit losses in these loan portfolios.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in non-accrual loans during the three year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2010

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">as well as longer than historical time-frames to foreclose on and sell homes.
Additionally, during 2010, the commercial
non-residential real estate market continued to deteriorate resulting in an increase in
troubled shopping centers, storage facilities, and office buildings. Residential non-accrual loans
increased due to prolonged foreclosure time frames, declining property values and high unemployment
rates. Non-accrual commercial non-mortgage and small business loans increased primarily due to the
deteriorating financial condition of certain of our borrowers, which we believe is the result of
Florida&#146;s depressed economy and a reduction in consumer spending associated with high unemployment.
The increase in commercial real estate non-accrual loans during the three year period ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010 reflects the migration of commercial residential loans to a non-accrual
classification during the entire period as well as commercial non-residential loans migrating to
non-accrual status during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher repossessed assets balances at December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to prior periods reflect
increased foreclosures of commercial real estate and residential loans. BankAtlantic attempts to
modify loans to credit worthy borrowers; however, the majority of BankAtlantic&#146;s non-accrual
commercial real estate loans are collateral dependent resulting in BankAtlantic having limited
alternatives on such loans other than initiating the foreclosure process. We also initiate the
foreclosure process on non-accrual residential loans upon unsuccessful loan modification attempts.
As a consequence of the increase in non-accrual loans, we expect repossessed assets to
significantly increase in the foreseeable future.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s other accruing impaired loans at December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 significantly
increased compared to prior periods primarily due to an increase in troubled debt restructured
loans (&#147;TDR&#148;). In response to current market conditions, BankAtlantic has developed loan
modification programs for certain borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. During the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, BankAtlantic modified the terms of certain commercial, small
business, residential and consumer home equity loans. Generally, the concessions made to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulties included the reduction of the loan&#146;s contractual interest rate,
conversion of amortizing loans to interest only payments or the deferral of interest payments to
the maturity date of the loan. Loans that are not delinquent at the date of TDR modification are
generally not placed on non-accrual. TDR modified non-accrual loans are not returned to an
accruing status and BankAtlantic does not reset days past due on delinquent TDR modified loans
until the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance under the TDR modified terms,
which is generally performance over a six month period. However, TDR modification of loans may not
result in increased collections from the borrower, and TDR modified loans which return to an
accruing status may subsequently be returned to nonaccrual status.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loans that comprise the above relationships are all collateral dependent. As such, we
established specific reserves or recognized partial charge-offs on these loans based on our
determination of the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. The fair value of the
collateral was determined using unadjusted third party appraisals for all relationships.
BankAtlantic performs quarterly impairment analyses on these credit relationships and may reduce
appraised values if market conditions significantly deteriorate subsequent to the appraisal date.
However, BankAtlantic&#146;s policy is to obtain a full appraisal within one year from the date of the
prior appraisal, unless the loan is in the process of foreclosure. A new appraisal is obtained at
the date of foreclosure.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our residential loan portfolio does not include negative amortization, option ARM or subprime
products; however, the majority of our residential loans are purchased residential jumbo loans and
certain of these loans potentially have outstanding loan balances significantly higher than related
collateral values as a result of real estate value declines in the housing markets. Additionally,
loans that were originated during 2005, 2006 and 2007 have experienced greater deterioration in
collateral value than loans originated in prior years resulting in higher loss experiences in these
groups of loans. Also, we have residential loans in California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada, which
are states that have experienced especially elevated foreclosures and delinquency rates.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our purchased residential loan portfolio includes interest-only loans. The terms of these
loans provide for possible future increases in a borrower&#146;s loan payments when the contractually
required repayments increase due to interest rate changes and the required amortization of the
principal amount begins. These payment increases could affect a borrower&#146;s ability to meet the
debt service on or repay the loan and lead to increased defaults and losses which could result in
additional provisions for residential loan losses.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic&#146;s residential loan portfolio included $550.2&nbsp;million
of interest-only loans. Approximately $54.9&nbsp;million of interest only residential loans became
fully amortizing during the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2010 and $52.1&nbsp;million of interest-only
residential loans are scheduled to become amortizing loans during the year ending December&nbsp;31,
2011.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residential real estate and home equity consumer loans that are 120&nbsp;days past due are
generally written down to estimated collateral value less costs to sell. As a consequence of longer
than historical timeframes to foreclose and sell residential real estate and the rapid decline in
residential real estate values where our collateral is located, BankAtlantic began performing
quarterly impairment evaluations during 2009 on residential real estate and real estate secured
consumer loans that were written down in prior periods to determine whether specific reserves were
necessary for further estimated market value declines. BankAtlantic also may establish specific
reserves on loans that are individually evaluated for impairment (generally commercial and small
business loans). The significant increase in commercial loan specific reserves reflects declines in
collateral values since December&nbsp;31, 2006.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial real estate loans account for the majority of the allowance for loan losses for
each of the years in the five year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. The commercial real estate loan
allowance as of December&nbsp;31, 2006 was associated with a slow-down in the homebuilding industry. The
substantial increase in the commercial real estate allowance for loan losses during 2007, 2008 and
2009 resulted in large part from a rapid and prolonged deterioration in the Florida real estate
market, and the significant downturn in the residential real estate market nationally. During 2008
and 2007, home sales and median home prices declined significantly on a year-over-year basis in all
major metropolitan areas in Florida, with conditions deteriorating rapidly during the fourth
quarter of 2008 in response to the overall loss of confidence in the financial markets. The housing
industry was experiencing a dramatic downturn and market conditions in the housing industry
continued to worsen throughout 2008 reflecting, in part, decreased availability of mortgage
financing for residential home buyers, reduced demand for new construction resulting in a
significant over-supply of housing inventory, and increased foreclosure rates. During 2009, the
decline in median home prices slowed and medium to low priced home sales began to recover from the
2008 lows. Also, during 2009 we began experiencing higher levels of commercial non-residential real
estate classified assets and charge-offs resulting from declining real estate values and financial
difficulties of our borrowers who experienced reduced cash flows from declining rental income.
Accordingly, the allowance for loan losses for commercial real estate loans was increased to
reflect higher estimated losses for this loan product as the then current economic and market
conditions resulted in unfavorable delinquency trends. During 2010, we partially charged off or
placed specific reserves on a significant portion of our commercial residential and commercial land
loans. In addition, the balances of our commercial real estate loans declined significantly and
the migration of loans to adversely classified risk ratings slowed resulting in a decrease in the
commercial real estate quantitative allowance for loan losses at December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to
December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three categories of loans in our commercial residential loan portfolio that have
resulted in the majority of losses in our commercial real estate loan portfolio. The loan balance
in these categories aggregated $132.9&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to $226.9&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2009. These categories are as follows:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &#147;builder land bank loan&#148; category consisted of 4 loans and aggregated $10.6&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to 7 loans aggregating $43.7&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009. This
category consists of land loans to borrowers who have or had land purchase option agreements with
regional and/or national builders. These loans were originally underwritten based on projected
sales of the developed lots to the builders/option holders, and timely repayment of the loans is
primarily dependent upon the sale of the property pursuant to the options. If the lots are not sold
as originally anticipated, the borrower may not be in a position to service the loan, with the
likely result being an increase in loan losses in this category. All four loans in this category
totaling $10.6&nbsp;million were on nonaccrual at December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to six loans in this
category totaling $42.6&nbsp;million on non-accrual at December&nbsp;31, 2009. BankAtlantic established $1.5
million and $23.2&nbsp;million of specific reserves on these loans as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &#147;land acquisition and development loan&#148; category consisted of 24 loans and aggregated
$118.8&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to 27 loans aggregating $171.9&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31,
2009. This loan category generally consists of loans secured by residential land which is intended
to be developed by the borrower and sold to homebuilders. These loans are generally underwritten
more stringently than builder land bank loans, as an option agreement with a regional or national
builder did not exist at the origination date. Thirteen loans in this category totaling $61.9
million were on nonaccrual at December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to ten loans totaling $60.2&nbsp;million on
non-accrual at December&nbsp;31, 2009. BankAtlantic established $14.1&nbsp;million and $7.1&nbsp;million of
specifics reserves on these loans as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &#147;land acquisition, development and construction loan&#148; category consisted of 3 loans and
aggregated $3.5&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to 6 loans aggregating $11.3&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2009. This category generally consists of loans secured by residential land which
will be fully developed by the borrower who may also construct homes on the property. These loans
generally involve property with a longer investment and development horizon, are guaranteed by the
borrower or individuals and/or are secured by additional collateral or equity such that it is
expected that the borrower will have the ability to service the debt for a longer period of time.
There were no loans in this category on nonaccrual at December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to one loan
totaling $3.8&nbsp;million on non-accrual at December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2010, BankAtlantic experienced heightened delinquencies and charge-offs associated with
commercial non-residential loans. Commercial non-residential loans generally represent permanent
financing for income producing properties and financing for the construction of income producing
properties. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic had $133.5&nbsp;million of commercial non-residential
loans on nonaccrual compared to $27.8&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance for consumer loans has increased for each of the years in the four year period
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, and declined at December&nbsp;31, 2010 from 2009 levels. The increase during
2006 was largely associated with the growth in outstanding home equity loans throughout the period
and the change in policy during 2004 to permit higher loan-to-value ratio loans based on Beacon
scores. The increase in the allowance for loan losses for consumer loans during 2007 compared to
2006 reflects unfavorable home equity loan delinquency trends, higher non-performing home equity
loans and a significant increase in charge-offs during the fourth quarter of 2007. The significant
increase in the allowance for consumer loan losses during 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due
to a significant increase in consumer home equity loan charge-offs, higher non-performing loans and
adverse delinquency trends. The adverse delinquency trends continued during 2009 as residential
property values in Florida continued to decline. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses at
December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to 2009 reflects what we believe to be declining charge-off and
delinquency trends during 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2007, the residential allowance for loan losses was maintained at 2006 levels as the
portfolio experienced minimal credit losses and no adverse delinquency trends. During 2008, as
property values nationwide declined and unemployment rates increased, our residential loan
portfolio began experiencing unfavorable delinquency trends and increased charge-offs. These
unfavorable delinquency trends accelerated throughout 2009 and remained at 2009 levels during 2010.
Jumbo residential loan credit trends for loans originated in 2005, 2006 and 2007 displayed higher
loss severity than loans originated in other years and losses on prime credit quality jumbo
residential loans out-paced losses on other prime based loans during 2009. As a consequence of
these adverse trends, the residential allowance for loan losses significantly increased at December
31, 2009 compared to the same 2008 and 2007 periods. During 2010, residential loan delinquencies
and the loss severity on BankAtlantic&#146;s non-performing residential loans stabilized resulting in a
decline in the residential quantitative allowance for losses at December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to
December&nbsp;31, 2009. Residential home prices are forecasted to decline slightly in most markets
during 2011 and improve during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012. A decline in residential home
prices during 2011 may also result in additional delinquencies and losses in our commercial
residential real estate portfolio in subsequent periods.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance for small business loan losses during 2007 was maintained at 2006 levels as
delinquency trends and credit losses remained unchanged. As economic conditions worsened during the
latter half of 2008, we began experiencing adverse trends and higher credit losses in our small
business loan portfolio. In response to these adverse trends, we increased the small business
allowance for loan losses significantly at December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared to December&nbsp;31, 2007. During
2009, the small business allowance for loan losses was maintained at 2008 levels as delinquencies
and charge-offs trends stabilized. During 2010, small business delinquencies remained at 2009
levels while charge-offs declined; however, criticized small business loans increased from 2009
levels resulting in an increase in the small business allowance for loan losses at December&nbsp;31,
2010 compared to December&nbsp;31, 2009.

in the event of
a sustained decline in real estate markets, and residential real estate in particular, and a
sustained slowdown in the economy in general, we may experience further deterioration in the credit
quality and performance of our loan portfolio. As a consequence, if conditions do not improve, we
will experience an increase in levels of non-performing assets and these increases will likely be
experienced across various loan categories.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower revenues from service charges on deposits during each of the years in the three
year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 primarily resulted from lower overdraft fee income. This
decrease in overdraft fee income reflects a decline in the total number of accounts which incurred
overdraft fees and a decrease in the frequency of overdrafts per deposit account. We believe that
the decline in the number of accounts incurring overdraft fees reflected our efforts to seek
customers who maintain deposit accounts with higher balances, regulatory changes, and changes in
customer behavior. The Federal Reserve adopted new overdraft rules (effective July&nbsp;1, 2010 for
new customers and August&nbsp;15, 2010 for existing customers), which among other requirements,
prohibit banks from automatically enrolling customers in overdraft protection programs.
Additionally, Congress has established a consumer protection agency which may further limit the
assessment of overdraft fees. In response to the changing industry practices and regulations,
BankAtlantic during the fourth quarter of 2010 began converting certain deposit products to
fee-based accounts that encourage higher checking account balances and the use of multiple bank
products in order to eliminate or reduce fees. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2011
BankAtlantic revised its overdraft policies instituting a cap on the number of overdrafts,
eliminating overdraft charges on small overdraft amounts and lowering the overdraft protection
amount per day. We anticipate that these trends will continue and that our overdraft fee income
will be lower in future periods partially offset by increased fees from the new deposit products
and expanded use of the banks services by deposit customers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in service charges and fees during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to
the same 2009 period primarily resulted from higher interchange income from the use of check cards
by our customers partially offset by lower fee income from our cruise ship operations. The
increased interchange income reflects higher debit card transaction volume for 2010 compared to
2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in other service charges and fees during 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due
to higher fees associated with a new vendor contract and an increase in cruise ship surcharge
income associated with an increased number of automated teller machines (&#147;ATM&#148;) on cruise ships.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Securities activities, net during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 includes $3.1&nbsp;million of
gains from the sales of $43.8&nbsp;million of agency securities and $11.9&nbsp;million of municipal
securities, respectively. The net proceeds from the sales of securities were used to enhance
BankAtlantic&#146;s liquidity. BankAtlantic also recognized a $0.3&nbsp;million loss in connection with
foreign currency derivative contracts entered into as an economic hedge of foreign currency in
cruise ship ATMs.

banking service provider as a result of business interruption issues relating to the conversion to
the service provider&#146;s products. The above increases in other non-interest income were partially

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s non-interest expense for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $236.3&nbsp;million, $258.8&nbsp;million
and $330.6&nbsp;million, respectively. Excluding $20.8&nbsp;million, $29.9&nbsp;million and $59.6&nbsp;million of
impairments and costs associated with debt redemptions, BankAtlantic&#146;s non-interest expense would
have been $215.5&nbsp;million, $228.9&nbsp;million and $271.1&nbsp;million, for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
The reduction in non-interest expense during the three year period reflects management&#146;s efforts to
reduce expenses and increase operating efficiencies. In response to the adverse economic
environment, we consolidated certain back-office facilities, sold five central Florida stores,
renegotiated vendor contracts, continued staff reductions, out-sourced certain back-office
functions and initiated other targeted expense reduction programs. In January&nbsp;2011, we agreed to
sell 19 branches and 2 related facilities in the Tampa area and the associated deposits to PNC. The
transaction is expected to close during June&nbsp;2011 and we expect the sale of the Tampa branches to
reduce annual non-interest expenses by approximately $15 to $20&nbsp;million. Management continues to
explore opportunities to further reduce operating expenses and increase operating efficiencies;
however, we may not be successful in these efforts.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial decline in employee compensation and benefits during each of the years in the
three year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 resulted primarily from workforce reductions, normal
attrition, as well as declines in personnel related to reduced store lobby and call center hours.
As a consequence of the work force reductions and normal attrition, the number of full-time
equivalent employees declined from 2,385 at December&nbsp;31, 2007 to 1,283 at December&nbsp;31, 2010, or
46%. The decline in the work force resulted in lower employee benefits, payroll taxes and
recruitment advertising. Also contributing to the decline in compensation was lower incentive
bonuses during 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008. Incentive bonuses were $2.5&nbsp;million, $6.1&nbsp;million
and $6.2&nbsp;million during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

$1.2&nbsp;million during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The reduction
in share based compensation expense reflects that no share based awards were granted to employees
during 2009 and 2008 and the reversal of prior period share based compensation expense as the
forfeiture rate on outstanding options was increased from 18% to 50% reflecting the significant
reduction in the workforce throughout the three year period.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in occupancy and equipment for each of the years in the three years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010 primarily resulted from the consolidation of back-office facilities resulting in
lower depreciation and rent expense. Depreciation and rent expenses were $16.2&nbsp;million and $11.4
million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to $18.2&nbsp;million and $12.8&nbsp;million during
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively, and $20.7&nbsp;million and $14.6&nbsp;million, respectively,
during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. The remaining decline in occupancy and equipment expenses
was primarily due to lower building maintenance, utilities and real estate taxes during the 2010
period compared to the same 2009 and 2008 periods.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic modified its marketing focus from
growing deposit account volume to enhancing BankAtlantic&#146;s relationship with customers. As a
result, BankAtlantic significantly reduced direct mail advertising and reduced gifts to customers
upon the opening of deposit accounts. Direct mail advertising and customer gift expenses declined
from $10.1&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 to $3.2&nbsp;million and $2.4&nbsp;million during the
same 2009 and 2010 periods.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the substantial decline in check losses during each of the years in the three
year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 primarily related to revisions to our overdraft policies which
began in 2008 as well as lower volume of new account growth.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher professional fees during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to the same
2009 period primarily resulted from legal and related costs in connection with the class-action
securities litigation and secondarily from legal costs associated with tax certificate litigation,
loan modifications and loan work-outs. Legal expenses were $11.4&nbsp;million during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to $8.3&nbsp;million during the same 2009 period. Legal expenses during the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 were partially offset by $4.5&nbsp;million of insurance reimbursements in
connection with the class action securities litigation. During 2010, litigation costs on cases
alleging claims covered by insurance exceeded the deductible under our director and officer
liability insurance and we began receiving eligible cost reimbursements from the insurance
carrier. Insurance claim reimbursements are recognized as a reduction to legal fees when the
claim is approved by the insurance carrier. In December&nbsp;2010 our insurance carrier for claims
under our director and officer liability insurance denied insurance coverage in connection with
the class action securities litigation for both the defense costs and any unfavorable judgment
against the Company on the grounds that the jury found intentional wrongful acts by certain senior
executive officers of the Company. While the Company disputes the validity of the denial of
coverage, the Company does not expect to receive additional reimbursement for litigation costs
associated with the class action securities litigation, unless the Company is able to successfully
contest the denial of insurance coverage. Additionally, BankAtlantic engaged consulting firms
during 2010 for assistance in process improvements and efficiency initiatives as well as
evaluating sources of non-interest income. Consulting fees were $1.5&nbsp;million during 2010 compared
to $0.6&nbsp;million during the same 2009 period.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher professional fees for 2009 compared to 2008 were mainly associated with legal costs
in connection with loan modifications, commercial loan work-outs, class-action securities
litigation and tax certificate activities litigation.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower telecommunication costs for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 compared to
the same 2008 period primarily resulted from switching during 2008 to a new vendor on more
favorable terms.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for tax certificate losses for each of the years in the three year period ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010 reflect charge-offs and increases in the allowance for tax certificate losses
associated with certificates acquired through bulk purchases in markets which are now distressed.
We ceased the bulk acquisition of tax certificates and our out-of-state tax certificate portfolio
has been reduced through redemptions.

the prepayment of a $2&nbsp;million FHLB advance obligation and $0.7&nbsp;million repayment of a
mortgage-backed bond that was scheduled to mature in September&nbsp;2013.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs associated with debt redemptions were the result of prepayment penalties incurred
upon the prepayment of $760&nbsp;million and $692&nbsp;million of FHLB advances in 2009 and 2008,
respectively. The prepayments in 2009 and 2008 were part of our effort to improve our liquidity
and net interest margin as short term borrowing interest rates were at historical lows.

associated with the decision to sell properties or terminate leases acquired for future branch

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Real estate owned impairments during 2010 and 2009 reflect a $3.6&nbsp;million and $3.1&nbsp;million
write-down associated with a real estate development acquired during the fourth quarter of 2006
when BankAtlantic took possession of the collateral securing a land acquisition and development
loan and, secondarily, from write-downs of residential, commercial and tax certificate real estate
owned. Impairment of real estate owned during 2008 was primarily associated with properties in
distressed markets acquired through tax certificate activities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impairment of assets held for sale relates to a management decision to pursue a sale of
BankAtlantic&#146;s Tampa branches. As a consequence, BankAtlantic reclassified its Tampa office
properties and equipment to held-for-sale and recognized a $4.5&nbsp;million impairment charge at the
transfer date.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic tests goodwill for potential impairment annually or during interim periods if
impairment indicators exist. Based on the results of an interim impairment evaluation, BankAtlantic
recorded an impairment charge of $9.1&nbsp;million during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009.
BankAtlantic performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September&nbsp;30, 2010 and determined
that its remaining goodwill of $13.1&nbsp;million in its capital services reporting unit was not
impaired, as the fair value of our capital services reporting unit exceeded the fair value of the
net assets by $14.1&nbsp;million. If market conditions do not improve or deteriorate further,
BankAtlantic may recognize additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the results of a goodwill impairment evaluation during 2008, BankAtlantic recorded an
impairment charge of $48.3&nbsp;million. All goodwill in the amount of $31.0&nbsp;million relating to
BankAtlantic&#146;s commercial lending reporting unit and all goodwill in the amount of $17.3&nbsp;million
relating to BankAtlantic&#146;s community banking reporting unit were determined to be impaired. The
impairments in the community banking and commercial lending business units reflect the on-going
negative trends in the financial services industry affecting the Company&#146;s market capitalization
and the credit quality of BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolios.

predefined level. In June&nbsp;2009, the FDIC imposed a special assessment on all depository
institutions of five basis points on adjusted total assets. BankAtlantic&#146;s portion of the FDIC
depository institution special assessment was $2.4&nbsp;million.

December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to the same 2008 period relates

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to BankAtlantic&#146;s recent history of losses and the sustained deterioration in economic
conditions, BankAtlantic maintains a deferred tax valuation allowance for its entire amount of net
deferred tax assets. The benefit for income taxes during 2010 primarily represents a reduction in
the deferred tax valuation allowance from continuing operations to reflect the future taxable
income associated with unrealized gains in accumulated other comprehensive income. The 2009
benefit for income taxes was due primarily to a change in tax laws in November&nbsp;2009 that extended
the net operating loss carry back period for 2009 taxable losses from two years to five years which
resulted in BankAtlantic recognizing a $31.7&nbsp;million income tax benefit.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between the effective tax rate and the expected federal income tax rate of 35%
during 2008 was due primarily to the disallowance of tax benefits associated with losses during
2008 and net deferred tax assets as a result of the establishment of a deferred tax valuation
allowance.

two commercial real estate loans acquired in a March&nbsp;2008 loan transfer from BankAtlantic that
were returned to an accrual status during 2008 as the borrowers&#146; cash flow improved upon obtaining
tenants for properties serving as collateral.

were comprised primarily of earnings from a BankAtlantic reverse repurchase agreement account and
dividends from an equity investment. Interest and dividend income on investments during the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 was comprised primarily of interest and dividends associated with a
portfolio of debt and equity securities managed by a money manager as well as earnings from a
reverse repurchase account with BankAtlantic. Earnings from the BankAtlantic reverse repurchase
account were $17,000, $28,000 and $0.2&nbsp;million, respectively, during the years ended December&nbsp;31,

expense recognized on the Parent Company&#146;s junior subordinated debentures. The decline in interest
expense reflects the historically low three month LIBOR interest rates during 2009 and 2010. The
decline in interest rates was partially offset by deferred interest on the junior subordinated
debentures. As previously discussed, the Parent Company has elected to defer the payment of
interest on all of its junior subordinated debentures, commencing with the first quarter of 2009.
The Parent Company is permitted under the terms of its obligations to defer interest payments for
up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods. During the deferral period, interest will continue to
accrue on the debentures and on the deferred interest, and

such deferred interest as interest expense in its financial statements. As a
consequence, the Parent Company&#146;s junior subordinated debentures average balances increased
from $300.0&nbsp;million during 2009 to $314.1&nbsp;million during 2010. Average interest rates on junior
subordinated debentures decreased from 5.18% during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 to 4.73%

private equity security for a $1.5&nbsp;million gain and sold shares of Stifel common stock received
from the sale of Ryan Beck for a $0.1&nbsp;million gain. Also, during 2009 the Parent Company recognized
a $1.6&nbsp;million other-than-temporary decline in value from an equity investment in an unrelated
financial institution.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, the Parent Company sold $54.2&nbsp;million of equity securities from its managed
investment portfolio, $108.4&nbsp;million of Stifel common stock and warrants to acquire 722,586 shares
of Stifel common stock for a net gain of $4.2&nbsp;million. The majority of the $181.8&nbsp;million of
proceeds from the sale of securities and warrants was used to purchase $94.5&nbsp;million of
non-performing loans from BankAtlantic and to contribute $65&nbsp;million of capital to BankAtlantic.
The Parent Company also recognized other-than-temporary impairment charges of $4.6&nbsp;million
associated with an investment in a private limited partnership and an equity investment in a
private placement.

primarily represent fees charged to BankAtlantic for executive management services. These fees are
eliminated in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.

2008 represents salaries, benefits and incentives for executive officers and administrative
personnel. The higher compensation expense during 2009 compared to 2010 and 2008 primarily
reflects higher incentive performance bonuses during 2009. Incentive performance bonuses based on
specific performance criteria were $0.2&nbsp;million, $2.9&nbsp;million and $1.6&nbsp;million during the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in professional fees during 2010 primarily resulted from higher consulting costs
associated with investment banking and other advisory services. Consulting costs were $1.5&nbsp;million,
$0.3&nbsp;million and $0.6&nbsp;million during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. The remaining professional fees were legal costs during each of the years in the
three year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. The legal fees were incurred in connection with the
Securities and Exchange Commission formal investigation, general corporate matters and foreclosure
costs associated with non-performing loans held in a work-out subsidiary of the Parent Company.

management costs and real estate owned losses of $1.9&nbsp;million, $0.9&nbsp;million and $2.5&nbsp;million,
respectively. The Parent Company also incurred $0.2&nbsp;million of loan servicing fees paid to
BankAtlantic for each of the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 related to the loans held
by its asset workout subsidiary. Also included in other expenses for the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2010, 2009 and 2008 were $0.6&nbsp;million, $0.3&nbsp;million and $0.3&nbsp;million, respectively, of fees paid to

provided to the Parent Company by BFC.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parent company did not recognize a tax benefit in connection with its 2010 and 2009
losses. The Parent Company recognized a provision for income taxes of $1.4&nbsp;million in 2008. These
amounts represent effective tax rates of 0%, 0% and 2.65% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
The change in the Parent Company&#146;s effective tax rate during the periods was primarily due to the
disallowance of tax benefits associated with the Parent Company&#146;s 2010, 2009 and 2008 losses as a
result of a deferred tax valuation allowance established during 2008 on the Parent Company&#146;s net
deferred tax assets.

established specific reserves or recognized partial charge-offs on these loans based on the fair
value of the collateral less costs to sell. The fair value of the collateral was determined using
unadjusted third party appraisals for all relationships. Management performs quarterly impairment
analyses on these credit relationships subsequent to the date of the appraisal and may reduce
appraised values if market conditions significantly deteriorate subsequent to the appraisal date.
However, our policy is to obtain a full appraisal within one year from the date of the prior
appraisal, unless the loan is in the process of foreclosure. A full appraisal is obtained at the
date of foreclosure.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for loan losses during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 resulted from
additional impairments due to updated loan collateral fair value estimates reflecting the continued
deterioration in the Florida residential real estate market. As previously stated, if market
conditions do not improve in the Florida real estate market, additional provisions for loan losses
and charge-offs may be required in subsequent periods.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Parent Company&#146;s principal source of liquidity is its cash and funds obtained
from its wholly-owned work-out subsidiary. The Parent Company also may obtain funds through
dividends, and through the issuance of equity and debt securities, although no dividends from
BankAtlantic are anticipated or contemplated for the foreseeable future. The Parent Company has
used its funds to contribute capital to its subsidiaries, pay debt service and shareholder
dividends, repay borrowings, invest in equity securities and other investments, and fund
operations, including funding servicing costs and real estate owned operating expenses of its
wholly-owned work-out subsidiary. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic Bancorp had approximately
$322.4&nbsp;million of junior subordinated debentures outstanding with maturities ranging from 2032
through 2037. The aggregate annual interest obligations on this indebtedness totaled approximately
$14.3&nbsp;million based on interest rates at December&nbsp;31, 2010, which are generally indexed to
three-month LIBOR. In order to preserve liquidity in the current economic environment, the Parent
Company elected in February&nbsp;2009 to commence deferring interest payments on all of its outstanding
junior subordinated debentures and to cease paying cash dividends on its common stock. The terms
of the junior subordinated debentures and the trust documents allow the Parent Company to defer
payments of interest for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods without default or penalty. During
the deferral period, the respective trusts have suspended the declaration and payment of dividends
on the trust preferred securities. The deferral election began as of March&nbsp;2009, and regularly
scheduled quarterly interest payments aggregating $28.2&nbsp;million that would otherwise have been paid
during the 24&nbsp;months ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 were deferred. The Parent Company has the ability
under the junior subordinated debentures to continue to defer interest payments through ongoing
appropriate notices to each of the trustees, and will make a decision each quarter as to whether to
continue the deferral of interest. During the deferral period, interest will continue to accrue on
the junior subordinated debentures at the stated coupon rate, including on the deferred interest,
and the Parent Company will continue to record the interest expense associated with the junior
subordinated debentures. During the deferral period, the Parent Company may not, among other things
and with limited exceptions, pay cash dividends on or repurchase its common stock nor make any
payment on outstanding debt obligations that rank equally with or junior to the junior subordinated
debentures. The Parent Company may end the deferral by paying all accrued and unpaid interest. The
Parent Company anticipates that it will continue to defer interest on its junior subordinated
debentures and will not pay dividends on its common stock for the foreseeable future. If the Parent
Company continues to defer interest on its junior subordinated debentures through the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2013, it will owe an aggregate of approximately $74.0&nbsp;million of unpaid interest based
on average interest rates as of December&nbsp;31, 2010. The Company&#146;s financial condition and liquidity
could be adversely affected if interest payments were deferred for a prolonged time period.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During each of the years in the two year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Parent Company
did not receive dividends from BankAtlantic. The ability of BankAtlantic to pay dividends or make
other distributions to the Parent Company in subsequent periods is subject to the Office of Thrift
Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;) approval as provided in the Bank Order. It is unlikely that the OTS will
approve a dividend from BankAtlantic based on BankAtlantic&#146;s regulatory capital levels. As such,
the Parent Company does not expect to receive cash dividends from BankAtlantic for the foreseeable
future. The Parent Company may receive dividends from its asset work-out subsidiary upon the
monetizing of the subsidiaries&#146; non-performing loans and real estate owned. However, the Parent
Company may not be able to monetize the loans or real estate owned on acceptable terms, if at all.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2010, the Company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission registering to offer, from time to time, up to $75&nbsp;million of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock,
preferred stock, subscription rights, warrants or debt securities. A description of the securities
offered and the expected use of the net proceeds from any sales will be outlined in a prospectus
supplement if and when offered. As a result of the completion of the rights offering discussed
below, $55&nbsp;million of securities remain available for future issuance under this registration
statement.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During June&nbsp;2010, the Company distributed to each holder of record who owned shares of the
Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock on June&nbsp;14, 2010 non-transferable
subscription rights to purchase 0.327 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock for each share of Class&nbsp;A and
Class&nbsp;B Common Stock owned on that date. The rights offering was for an aggregate amount of $25
million with a subscription price of $1.50 per share. Shareholders who exercised their basic
subscription rights in full were given the opportunity to request to purchase additional shares of
the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock that were not subscribed for in the rights offering. The rights
offering was completed on July&nbsp;20, 2010 with the Company issuing an aggregate of 13,340,379 shares
of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock for net proceeds of approximately $20&nbsp;million, including 10,000,000 shares
issued to BFC.</DIV>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2010, the Company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission registering the offer and sale of up to $125&nbsp;million of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock through an
underwritten public offering. This registration statement has not yet been declared effective and
it is uncertain whether the Company will pursue the sale of any of the shares of Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock under this registration statement.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During January&nbsp;2010, the Parent Company commenced cash offers to purchase all of its
outstanding trust preferred securities having an aggregate principal amount of approximately $285
million at a purchase price of $200 per $1,000 liquidation amount, or an aggregate of $57&nbsp;million.
During February&nbsp;2010, the offer to purchase with respect to the approximate $55&nbsp;million of publicly
traded trust preferred securities issued by BBC Capital Trust II expired without any such trust
preferred securities being repurchased, while the expiration date for the offers to purchase
relating to the remaining $230&nbsp;million of trust preferred securities was extended. In August
2010, we terminated the offers with respect to the remaining $230&nbsp;million of trust preferred
securities and dismissed a lawsuit filed against one of the trustees which was the holder of a
portion of a series of trust preferred securities held in a collateralized debt obligation pool.
Upon the termination of the offers, the Company recognized $0.8&nbsp;million of tender transaction costs
included in other expenses in the Company&#146;s statement of operations during the year ended December
31, 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;28, 2009, the Company distributed to each record holder of its Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock as of August&nbsp;24, 2009 non-transferable subscription rights to purchase
4.441 shares of its Class&nbsp;A Common Stock for each share of Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock owned
on that date. The subscription price was $2.00 per share and the Company completed the rights
offering on September&nbsp;29, 2009 and issued 37,980,936 shares of its Class&nbsp;A Common Stock to
exercising shareholders, including 14,943,731 shares issued to BFC. The net proceeds from this
rights offering were $75.5&nbsp;million, net of offering costs. The Company used the net proceeds to
contribute $75&nbsp;million of capital to BankAtlantic.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, the Parent Company contributed $28&nbsp;million
and $105&nbsp;million, respectively, of capital to BankAtlantic.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parent Company is generally required to provide BankAtlantic with managerial assistance
and capital. Any such financing could be sought through public or private offerings, including a
rights offering, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Additionally, we could pursue
financings at the Parent Company level or directly at BankAtlantic or both. Any financing involving
the issuance of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock or securities convertible or exercisable for our Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock could be highly dilutive for our existing shareholders and any issuance of stock at
the BankAtlantic level would dilute the Company&#146;s ownership interest in BankAtlantic. Such
financing may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parent Company has the following cash and investments that it believes provide a source
for potential liquidity based on values at December&nbsp;31, 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>BankAtlantic Liquidity and Capital Resources</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s primary sources of funds are deposits; principal repayments of loans, tax
certificates and securities available for sale; proceeds from the sale of loans and securities
available for sale; proceeds from securities sold under agreements to repurchase; advances from
FHLB; Treasury and Federal Reserve lending programs; interest payments on loans and securities;
capital contributions from the Parent Company and other funds generated by operations. These funds
are primarily utilized to fund loan disbursements and purchases, deposit outflows, repayments of
securities sold under agreements to repurchase, repayments of advances from FHLB and other
borrowings, purchases of tax certificates and securities available for sale, acquisitions of
properties and equipment, and operating expenses. BankAtlantic&#146;s liquidity will depend on its
ability to generate sufficient cash to support loan demand, to meet deposit withdrawals, and to
pay operating expenses. BankAtlantic&#146;s securities portfolio provides an internal source of
liquidity through its short-term investments as well as scheduled maturities and interest
payments. Loan repayments and loan sales also provide an internal source of liquidity.
BankAtlantic reduced its loan portfolio during 2010 and reinvested the excess cash proceeds in
short term investments and interest bearing deposits at other banks in order to improve its
liquidity. BankAtlantic&#146;s liquidity is also dependent, in part, on its ability to maintain or
increase deposit levels and availability under lines of credit and Treasury and Federal Reserve
lending programs. BankAtlantic&#146;s ability to increase or maintain deposits is impacted by
competition from other financial institutions and alternative investments as well as the current
low interest rate environment. Such competition, an increase in interest rates or an increase in
liquidity needs, may require BankAtlantic to offer higher interest rates to maintain deposits,
which may not be successful in generating deposits, and which would increase its cost of funds or
reduce its net interest income. BankAtlantic is restricted by the OTS from offering interest
rates on its deposits which are significantly higher than market area rates. Additionally,
BankAtlantic&#146;s current lines of credit may not be available when needed as these lines of credit
are subject to periodic review and may be terminated or reduced at the discretion of the issuing
institutions or reduced based on availability of qualifying collateral. BankAtlantic&#146;s unused
lines of credit increased from $760&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 to $843&nbsp;million as of December
31, 2010 due to lower FHLB advance outstanding balances and increases in available collateral
resulting from the purchase of agency and municipal securities partially offset by lower loan
balances. Additionally, interest rate changes, additional collateral requirements, disruptions in
the capital markets, deterioration in BankAtlantic&#146;s financial condition, litigation or regulatory
action may make borrowings unavailable or make terms of the borrowings and deposits less
favorable. There is a risk that our cost of funds will increase and that the borrowing capacity
from funding sources may decrease.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into
law permanently raising the maximum standard deposit insurance to $250,000 per depositor, for each
ownership category as defined by the FDIC. The Act also provides for full deposit insurance on
non-interest bearing deposit accounts until December&nbsp;31, 2012.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2008, the FDIC adopted a restoration plan that increased the rates depository
institutions pay for deposit insurance. Under the restoration plan, the assessment rates were
raised by 7 basis points for all depository institutions beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2009 and the
assessment rates were raised again on April&nbsp;1, 2009 based on the risk rating of each financial
institution. Additionally, the FDIC imposed a 5 basis point special assessment as of June&nbsp;30, 2009
that was paid in September&nbsp;2009. As a consequence of the increased assessment rates,
BankAtlantic&#146;s FDIC insurance premium increased from $2.8&nbsp;million during the year ended December
31, 2008 to $10.1&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. In September&nbsp;2009, the FDIC
required financial institutions to prepay, in December&nbsp;2009, their estimated quarterly FDIC
insurance assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. During
the fourth quarter of 2009, BankAtlantic remitted $31.3&nbsp;million to the FDIC for prepaid
assessments. Included in the Company&#146;s statement of financial condition as of December&nbsp;31, 2010
and 2009 was $31.3&nbsp;million and $23.4&nbsp;million, respectively, of prepaid FDIC deposit assessments.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FHLB has granted BankAtlantic a line of credit capped at 30% of assets subject to
available collateral, with a maximum term of ten years. BankAtlantic utilized its FHLB line of
credit to borrow $170&nbsp;million and to obtain a $222&nbsp;million letter of credit primarily securing
public deposits as of December&nbsp;31, 2010. The line of credit is secured by a blanket lien on
BankAtlantic&#146;s residential mortgage loans and certain commercial real estate and consumer home
equity loans. BankAtlantic&#146;s unused available borrowings under this line of credit were
approximately $612&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010. An additional source of liquidity for
BankAtlantic is its securities portfolio. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic had $195&nbsp;million of
unpledged securities that could be sold or pledged for additional borrowings with the FHLB, the
Federal Reserve or other financial institutions. BankAtlantic is a participating institution in
the Federal Reserve Treasury Investment Program for up to $2.2&nbsp;million in funding and at December
31, 2010, BankAtlantic had $1.2&nbsp;million of short-term borrowings outstanding under this program.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">participate in the Federal Reserve&#146;s discount window program under
its secondary credit program. The amount that can be borrowed under this program is dependent on
the delivery of collateral to the Federal Reserve, and BankAtlantic had unused available borrowings
of approximately $35.5&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, with no amounts outstanding under this
program at December&nbsp;31, 2010. We are not permitted to incur day-light overdrafts in our Federal
Reserve bank account and accordingly, our intent is to continue to maintain sufficient funds at the
Federal Reserve to support intraday activity. The above lines of credit are subject to periodic
review and any of the above borrowings may be limited, or may not be available to us at all or
additional collateral could be required, in which case BankAtlantic&#146;s liquidity could be materially
adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic also has various relationships to execute repurchase agreements, which may to a
limited extent be utilized as an alternative source of liquidity. At December&nbsp;31, 2010,
BankAtlantic had $21.5&nbsp;million of securities sold under agreements to repurchase outstanding,
representing 0.5% of total assets. Additional repurchase agreement borrowings are subject to
available collateral. Additionally, BankAtlantic had total cash on hand or with other financial
institutions of $558.8&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010. BankAtlantic&#146;s ending cash on hand or with
other financial institutions was significantly higher than BankAtlantic&#146;s average cash on hand or
with other financial institutions during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 of $360.0&nbsp;million. The
higher balances at year-end reflect the anticipated sale of the Tampa branches and a management
decision to maintain higher liquidity at period end.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brokered deposits have previously served as an additional source of liquidity. Included in
deposits at December&nbsp;31, 2010 was $14.1&nbsp;million in brokered deposits. BankAtlantic is currently
restricted by the OTS from acquiring additional brokered deposits or renewing its existing brokered
deposits, and expects the balance of its brokered deposits to decline for the foreseeable future.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s liquidity may be affected by unforeseen demands on cash. Our objective in
managing liquidity is to maintain sufficient resources of available liquid assets to address our
funding needs. Multiple market disruptions and regulatory actions have made it more difficult for
us and for financial institutions in general to borrow money. We cannot predict with any degree of
certainty how long these adverse market conditions may continue, nor can we anticipate the degree
that such market conditions may impact our operations. Deterioration in the performance of other
financial institutions may adversely impact the ability of all financial institutions to access
liquidity. Further deterioration in the financial markets may further impact us or result in
additional market-wide liquidity problems, and affect our liquidity position. We believe
BankAtlantic has improved its liquidity position during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 by
reducing assets, increasing agency guaranteed securities and paying down borrowings.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s commitment to originate and purchase loans was $23.3&nbsp;million and $2.6&nbsp;million,
respectively, at December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to $62.6&nbsp;million of commitments to originate loans at
December&nbsp;31, 2009. BankAtlantic had no commitments to purchase loans at December&nbsp;31, 2009. At
December&nbsp;31, 2010, total loan commitments represented approximately 0.8% of net loans receivable.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic had mortgage-backed securities of approximately $22.7
million pledged to secure securities sold under agreements to repurchase.</DIV>

The table below presents the contractual principal repayments and maturity dates of our loan
portfolio and securities available for sale at December&nbsp;31, 2010. The total amount of principal
repayments on loans and securities contractually due after December&nbsp;31, 2011 was $2.8&nbsp;billion, of
which $1.1&nbsp;billion have fixed interest rates and $1.7&nbsp;billion have floating or adjustable interest
rates. Actual principal repayments may vary from the amounts due at scheduled payment dates where
the borrower fails to make all or a portion of the required payments or BankAtlantic agrees to
extend the scheduled payment dates and/or modifies the amount due on such dates. The table below

principal repayments may differ from information shown below (in thousands):</DIV>

Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#147;FDICIA&#148;). Regulations implementing the prompt corrective
action provisions of FDICIA define specific capital categories based on FDICIA&#146;s defined capital
ratios, as discussed more fully in Part&nbsp;I under &#147;Regulation of Federal Savings Banks&#148;.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the February&nbsp;2011 Bank Order, BankAtlantic is required to attain by June&nbsp;30, 2011
and maintain a tier 1/core capital ratio equal to or greater than 8% and a total risk-based capital
ratio equal to or greater than 14%. BankAtlantic had maintained its regulatory capital ratios at
levels that exceed prompt corrective action &#147;well capitalized&#148; requirements during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010. However, based on BankAtlantic&#146;s risk profile, the OTS raised its regulatory
capital requirements above the &#147;well capitalized&#148; amounts. The Parent Company and BankAtlantic will
seek to meet the higher capital requirements through the anticipated net gain upon consummation of
the Tampa branch sale to PNC and through other efforts that may include the issuance of its Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock through a public or private offering. Additionally, BankAtlantic may continue to seek
to reduce its asset size in order to improve its regulatory capital ratios, although this may make
it more difficult to achieve profitability. The Company may not be successful in raising additional
capital in subsequent periods and the sale of the Tampa branches may not be consummated in the time
frame anticipated, upon the contemplated terms, or at all. The inability to raise capital or
otherwise meet regulatory requirements could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s
business, results of operations and financial condition.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in cash flows from operating activities during 2009 compared to 2008 was
primarily due to an increase in other assets reflecting the $31.3&nbsp;million prepayment of FDIC
insurance assessments and lower non-interest expenses partially offset by a decline in net
interest income and non-interest income.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in cash flows from investing activities during 2010 compared to 2009 primarily
resulted from the higher purchases of short-term securities available for sale and tax

purchases was partially offset by higher loan repayments and loan sales during 2010 compared to

resulted from a decline in interest earning assets as loan and securities repayments exceeded loan
originations and securities purchased. Additionally, in order to further reduce assets during
2009, the Company sold securities available for sale. The Company reduced its total assets during
2009 and 2008 in order to improve its liquidity and regulatory capital levels in response to the
difficult economic environment.</DIV>

resulted form the significant prepayment of FHLB and short term borrowings during 2009. FHLB
advance and short term borrowing balances declined from $1,251.5&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008 to
$309.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009 to $192.8&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010. The above increases

from the prepayment of FHLB advances and short term borrowings. Funds from the repayment of loans

in financing cash flows were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lines of credit are primarily revolving lines to home equity and business loan customers. The
business loans usually expire in less than one year and the home equity lines generally expire in
15&nbsp;years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by BankAtlantic to guarantee the
performance of a customer to a third party. BankAtlantic standby letters of credit are generally
issued to customers in the construction industry guaranteeing project performance. These types of
standby letters of credit had a maximum exposure of $8.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010. BankAtlantic
also issues standby letters of credit to commercial lending customers guaranteeing the payment of
goods and services. These types of standby letters of credit had a maximum exposure of $1.5
million at December&nbsp;31, 2010. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private
borrowing arrangements and have maturities of one year or less. The credit risk involved in
issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.
BankAtlantic may hold certificates of deposit and residential and commercial real estate liens as
collateral for such commitments, similar to other types of borrowings.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other commercial commitments are agreements to lend funds to a customer subject to conditions
established in the commitment. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating lease obligations held for sublease represent minimum future lease payments on
executed leases that the Company intends to sublease or terminate. These lease agreements were

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating Tampa lease obligations represent minimum future lease payments associated with our
Tampa branches. BankAtlantic expects to assign these leases to PNC upon consummation of the
agreement to sell the Tampa branches.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating lease obligations held for use represent minimum future lease payments in which the
Company is the lessee for real estate and equipment leases.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pension obligation represents the accumulated benefit obligation of the Company&#146;s defined
benefit plan at December&nbsp;31, 2010. The payments represent the estimated benefit payments through
2020, the majority of which are anticipated to be funded through plan assets. The table does not
include estimated benefit payments after 2021. The actuarial present value of the projected
accumulated benefit obligation was $34.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010. The plan was underfunded by
$9.7&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010. The Company is required to fund plan deficits over a seven
year period which would include a contribution of $0.5&nbsp;million to the pension plan for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. The Company&#146;s future cash contribution may increase or decrease depending
on the performance of the plan assets and the increase or decrease of the projected benefit
obligation in subsequent periods.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Ryan Beck sale agreement, the Parent Company agreed to indemnify Stifel and
its affiliates against any claims of any third party losses attributable to disclosed or
undisclosed liabilities that arose out of the conduct or activities of Ryan Beck prior to the
Stifel acquisition of Ryan Beck. The indemnification of the third party losses is limited to those
losses which individually exceed $100,000, and in the aggregate exceed $3&nbsp;million with a $20
million limitation on the indemnity. The indemnified losses include federal taxes and litigation
claims. The indemnification period for claims asserted ended on August&nbsp;31, 2009. Included in the
Company&#146;s consolidated statement of operations in discontinued operations during each of the years
in the two years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 was $0.5&nbsp;million in indemnification costs.</DIV>

(BankAtlantic Bancorp)</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic has terminated various operating leases originally executed for store expansion
or back-office facilities. In certain lease terminations the landlord consents to the assignment
of the lease to a third party; however, BankAtlantic remains secondarily liable for the lease
obligation. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic was secondarily liable for $9.4&nbsp;million of lease
payments under leases that were assigned to third parties. BankAtlantic uses the same credit
policies in assigning these leases to third parties as it does in originating loans.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other obligations are primarily legally binding agreements with vendors for advertising,
marketing and sponsorship services as well as unrecognized tax benefits.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to lawsuits as plaintiff or defendant involving
its bank operations, lending and tax certificates. Although the Company believes it has meritorious
defenses in all current legal actions, the outcome of litigation and regulatory matters and timing
of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict and uncertain.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserves are accrued for matters in which it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the
amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. These accrual amounts as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 are
not material to the Company&#146;s financial statements. The actual costs of resolving these legal
claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for these claims. (Refer to
note 27, Commitments and Contingencies, for disclosure on range of reasonably possible losses
estimated for legal claims).</DIV>

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>BFC</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market valuations
resulting from interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and
equity price risk. BFC&#146;s primary market risk is equity price risk and interest rate risk.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because BankAtlantic Bancorp and Bluegreen are consolidated in BFC&#146;s financial statements, a
significant change in the market price of the stock of those companies would not directly impact
BFC&#146;s financial results, but would likely have an effect on the market price of BFC&#146;s common stock.
The market price of BFC&#146;s common stock and the market prices of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s and
Bluegreen&#146;s common stock are important to the valuation and financing capability of BFC. BFC also
owns 800,000 shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock for which no market is available. The
ability to realize or liquidate this investment will depend on future market and economic
conditions and the ability to register the shares of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock acquired by BFC in the
event it converts its shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred stock, all of which are subject to
significant risk. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the closing price of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock was $8.01 per
share. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the market value of the 800,000 shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible
Preferred Stock owned by BFC, if converted to Benihana&#146;s Common Stock, would have been
approximately $12.6&nbsp;million.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Woodbridge</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge may be subject to interest rate risk on its and its subsidiaries&#146; long term debt.
As previously discussed, during the fourth quarter of 2010, Core relinquished to its lenders title
to substantially all of the land Core owned in both Florida and South Carolina and pledged its
ownership interests in several of its subsidiaries. In turn, the lenders released Core and its
subsidiaries from their obligations with respect to the debt. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010 (and after
giving effect to the resolution of Core&#146;s debt), Woodbridge, including its wholly-owned Carolina
Oak subsidiary, had $91.3&nbsp;million in borrowings with adjustable rates tied to the Prime Rate and/or
LIBOR and $42.3&nbsp;million in borrowings with fixed or initially-fixed rates. This includes $37.2
million of indebtedness tied to the Prime Rate for which Woodbridge is the obligor that is alleged
to be in default. As previously discussed, Woodbridge and Carolina Oak are negotiating with the
investor group which holds the note to finalize a settlement agreement to resolve the debt. There
is no assurance that the settlement agreement will be entered into on the contemplated terms, or at
all.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Bluegreen</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen have increased the sales prices of its VOIs periodically and have experienced
increased construction and development costs from time to time during the last several years.
There is no assurance that Bluegreen will be able to increase or maintain the current level of its
sales prices or that increased construction costs will not have a material adverse impact on its
gross margin. In addition, to the extent that inflation in general or increased prices for
Bluegreen VOIs adversely impacts consumer demand, Bluegreen&#146;s results of operations could be
adversely impacted. While Bluegreen have previously reduced sales prices of its homesites in
response to low levels of consumer demand, these same factors may continue to affect its Bluegreen
Communities segment in the future.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2010, Bluegreen&#146;s total revenues and net assets denominated in a currency other than
U.S. dollars represented approximately 3% and less than 1% of our consolidated revenues and its
consolidated assets, respectively. Sales generated by Bluegreen Properties, N.V., its subsidiary in
Aruba, are transacted in U.S. dollars. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates
have not historically been significant to its operations or net assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen had fixed interest rate debt of approximately $556.1
million and floating interest rate debt of approximately $268.8&nbsp;million before purchase accounting
adjustment. In addition, the majority of Bluegreen&#146;s notes receivable from VOI and homesite
customers were comprised of fixed rate loans. The floating interest rates are based either upon the
prevailing prime or LIBOR rates. For floating rate financial instruments, interest rate changes do
not generally affect the market value of debt but do impact future earnings and cash flows,
assuming other factors are held constant. Conversely, for fixed rate financial instruments,
interest rate changes affect the market value of the debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent inflationary trends, tightened credit markets or other factors affect interest
rates, Bluegreen debt service costs may increase. If interest rates increased or decreased one
percentage point, the effect on interest expense related to Bluegreen&#146;s variable-rate debt would be
an annual increase or a decrease of approximately $2.7&nbsp;million, based on December&nbsp;31, 2010
balances. A similar change in interest rates would affect the total fair value of Bluegreen&#146;s fixed
rate debt by an immaterial amount. This analysis does not consider the effects of changes in the
level of overall economic activity that could result due to interest rate changes. Further, in the
event of a change in interest rates, Bluegreen would likely attempt to take actions to mitigate any
exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken
and their possible effects, the foregoing sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial
structure.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic has developed a model using standard industry software to measure its interest
rate risk. The model performs a sensitivity analysis that measures the effect on its net interest
income of changes in interest rates. The model measures the impact that parallel interest rate
shifts of 100 and 200 basis points would have on net interest income over a 12&nbsp;month period.</DIV>

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;16, 2009, we acquired approximately 7.4&nbsp;million additional shares of Bluegreen&#146;s common
stock, increasing our ownership interest to 16.9&nbsp;million shares, or approximately 52%, of
Bluegreen&#146;s outstanding common stock. Accordingly, we currently have a controlling interest in
Bluegreen and, under generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;), Bluegreen&#146;s results from
the November&nbsp;16, 2009 acquisition date are consolidated in our financial statements. Prior to
November&nbsp;16, 2009, we owned approximately 9.5&nbsp;million shares, representing approximately 29%, of
Bluegreen&#146;s outstanding common stock. The approximately 29% investment in Bluegreen was accounted
for under the equity method of accounting and, under GAAP, we reported our interest in Bluegreen&#146;s
earnings or losses in our consolidated financial statements. In accordance with applicable
accounting guidance relating to Bluegreen&#146;s status as a &#147;significant subsidiary&#148; during the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, we have attached as Exhibit&nbsp;99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K
Bluegreen&#146;s audited financial statements for each of the years in the three year period ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010, including the report of Ernst &#038; Young LLP, Bluegreen&#146;s independent registered
public accounting firm.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC Financial Corporation
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the accompanying consolidated
statements of financial condition and the related consolidated statements of operations, of
comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of BFC Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries at December&nbsp;31,
2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, based on our audit and
the report of other auditors, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, based on criteria established in <I>Internal
Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). The Company&#146;s management is responsible for these financial statements, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#146;s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item&nbsp;9A. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting based on our integrated audits. We did not audit the financial statements or internal
control over financial reporting of Bluegreen Corporation (&#147;Bluegreen&#148;), an approximately 52
percent-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company at December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009. The 2010
Bluegreen financial statements audited by other auditors were prepared on a &#147;historical&#148; basis
(prior to purchase accounting adjustments from the November&nbsp;2009 acquisition discussed in Note 4
to the financial statements) and reflect total assets of $1,255.9&nbsp;million and total revenue of
$365.7&nbsp;million (subsequently adjusted by the Company to total assets of $1,195.8&nbsp;million and total
revenue of $392.9&nbsp;million for the application and subsequent effect of purchase accounting
adjustments.) The 2009 Bluegreen financial statements audited by other auditors were prepared on a
&#147;historical&#148; basis (prior to purchase accounting adjustments from the November&nbsp;2009 acquisition)
and reflect total assets of $1,131.3&nbsp;million (subsequently adjusted by the Company to $889.3
million for the application and subsequent effect of purchase accounting adjustments).
Additionally, we did not audit the financial statements of Bluegreen, an approximately 29
percent-owned equity investment of the Company as of and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008,
which statements represent equity in the net gain (loss)&nbsp;of approximately ($154,000) (prior to the
amortization of basis difference of $13.9&nbsp;million) for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. We
audited the purchase accounting adjustments necessary to convert the &#147;historical&#148; basis financial
statements of Bluegreen to the basis reflected in the Company&#146;s 2010 and 2009 consolidated
financial statements, as well as the other-than-temporary impairment and amortization of the basis
difference recorded in the Company&#146;s 2008 financial statements. The financial statements and
internal control over financial reporting of Bluegreen Corporation were audited by other auditors
whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our opinion expressed herein, insofar as it
relates to the historical amounts included for Bluegreen Corporation and as to the effectiveness of
its internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, is based solely on the
report of the other auditors. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in
which it accounts for transfers of financial assets and consolidation of variable interest entities
in 2010. As discussed in Note 1, on November&nbsp;16, 2009, the Company purchased a controlling
interest in Bluegreen and, effective that date, consolidated the financial statements of Bluegreen
in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. As discussed in Note 1, the Company changed the
manner in which it accounts for business combinations and noncontrolling interests in 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Management&#146;s assessment and our audit of BFC Financial Corporation&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting also included controls over the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with the instructions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Savings and Loan
Holding Companies (OTS Form&nbsp;H-(b) 11) to comply with the reporting requirements of Section&nbsp;112 of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA). A company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Basis of Financial Statement Presentation &#151; </I></B>BFC Financial Corporation (&#147;BFC&#148; or, unless
otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, &#147;we&#148;, &#147;us&#148;, &#147;our&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a
diversified holding company whose principal holdings include a controlling interest in BankAtlantic
Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including BankAtlantic (&#147;BankAtlantic Bancorp&#148;), a controlling
interest in Bluegreen Corporation and its subsidiaries (&#147;Bluegreen&#148;), and a non-controlling
interest in Benihana, Inc. (&#147;Benihana&#148;). BFC also holds interests in other investments and
subsidiaries. As a result of its position as the controlling shareholder of BankAtlantic Bancorp,
BFC is a &#147;unitary savings bank holding company&#148; regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision
(&#147;OTS&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, BFC consummated its merger with Woodbridge Holdings Corporation
pursuant to which Woodbridge Holdings Corporation merged with and into Woodbridge Holdings, LLC
(&#147;Woodbridge&#148;), BFC&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary which continued as the surviving company of the
merger and the successor entity to Woodbridge Holdings Corporation. As a result of the merger,
Woodbridge Holdings Corporation&#146;s separate corporate existence ceased and its Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
is no longer publicly traded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;16, 2009, we purchased approximately 7.4&nbsp;million additional shares of Bluegreen&#146;s
common stock, which increased our ownership in Bluegreen from 9.5&nbsp;million shares, or 29%, to 16.9
million shares, or 52%, of Bluegreen&#146;s outstanding stock. As a result of the purchase, we now hold
a controlling interest in Bluegreen and, accordingly, have consolidated Bluegreen&#146;s results since
November&nbsp;16, 2009 into our financial statements. Any references to Bluegreen&#146;s results of
operations in 2009 includes only 45&nbsp;days of activity for Bluegreen relating to the period from
November&nbsp;16, 2009, the date of the share purchase, through December&nbsp;31, 2009 <B>(</B>the &#147;Bluegreen
Interim Period&#148;). Prior to November&nbsp;16, 2009, our approximate 29% equity investment in Bluegreen
was accounted for under the equity method. See Note 4 for additional information about the
Bluegreen share acquisition on November&nbsp;16, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GAAP requires that BFC consolidate the financial results of the entities in which it has
controlling interest. As a consequence, the assets and liabilities of all such entities are
presented on a consolidated basis in BFC&#146;s financial statements. However, except as otherwise
noted, the debts and obligations of the consolidated entities, including BankAtlantic Bancorp,
Bluegreen, and Woodbridge are not direct obligations of BFC and are non-recourse to BFC. Similarly,
the assets of those entities are not available to BFC absent a dividend or distribution from those
entities. The recognition by BFC of income from controlled entities is determined based on the
total percent of economic ownership in those entities. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, we owned approximately
52% of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock and had an approximately 45% ownership interest and 71% voting
interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s business activities currently consist of (i)&nbsp;Real Estate and Other and (ii)
Financial Services. The Company currently reports the results of operations of these business
activities through six reportable segments: BFC Activities, Real Estate Operations, Bluegreen
Resorts, Bluegreen Communities, BankAtlantic and BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company. Bluegreen&#146;s
results of operations are reported through the Bluegreen Resorts and Bluegreen Communities
segments. The Company&#146;s Financial Services business activities include BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
results of operations and are reported in two segments: BankAtlantic and BankAtlantic Bancorp
Parent Company. See Note 34 for additional information about our segments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revisions to Consolidated Financial Statements &#151; </I></B>The allocation of the Bluegreen purchase price was
based on preliminary estimates of the fair value of Bluegreen&#146;s inventory and contracts, and is
subject to change within the measurement period as valuations are finalized. If the amounts are
changed within the measurement period in a business combination, then the adjustment to change
these provisional amounts are retrospectively adjusted as of the date of acquisition. Additionally,
any offset relating to amortization/accretion is also retrospectively adjusted in the appropriate
periods. The company finalized the valuations in the fourth quarter of 2010. These adjustments
resulted in a decrease in total assets and total liabilities of approximately $3.4&nbsp;million and $3.0
million, respectively, and a decrease in total equity of approximately $0.4&nbsp;million. Furthermore,
the net income attributable to BFC decreased by approximately $289,000 and earnings per share from
continuing operations decreased by approximately $0.01 per common share. For further discussion on
such adjustments, See Note 4 &#151; Share Acquisitions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, during the fourth quarter, management identified certain errors in its
previously reported financial statements for 2010 and 2009. Because these errors are not material
to the Company&#146;s financial statements for 2010 or 2009, individually or in the aggregate, the
Company corrected these errors as revisions to its quarterly financial statements in 2010 and its
December&nbsp;31, 2009 financial statements. These adjustments include entries to correct errors in the
following areas: the recognition of interest income associated with the acquired notes receivable
in accordance with the accounting guidance <I>Loans and Debt Securities with Deteriorated Credit
Quality</I>; an adjustment to the provision for loan losses for the acquired notes receivable;
interest expense recognition for notes payable of certain defaulted debt at Core Communities and
Carolina Oak at the defaulted interest rate, where the stated interest rate was previously used;
the recognition of income tax benefits associated with unrealized gains in accumulated other
comprehensive income; and an adjustment to deferred taxes to correct an impairment to real estate
inventory which was reflected post the acquisition date and accounted for as a temporary
difference, which should have been included in the determination of deferred taxes at the
acquisition date, November&nbsp;16, 2009, as part of the Bluegreen purchase price allocation.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accounting policies applied by the Company conform to accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Use of Estimates &#151; </I></B>In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the statements of financial
condition and operations for the periods presented. Actual results could differ significantly from
those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate
to the determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations,
the allowance for loan losses, evaluation of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets for
impairment, valuation of securities, evaluation of securities for impairment and
other-than-temporary declines in value, the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with
foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans, revenue recognition on percent complete projects,
determination of the valuation of real estate assets and impairment, estimated costs to complete
construction, the amount of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, accounting for uncertain
tax positions, contingencies and litigation, and accounting for share-based compensation.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Consolidation Policy &#151; </I></B>The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of all the Company&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiaries, BankAtlantic Bancorp and Bluegreen, as well as
other entities in which the Company and its subsidiaries hold controlling financial interests and
variable interest entities (&#147;VIEs&#148;) if the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary of the entity.
All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated among consolidated
entities.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of operations of Bluegreen have been consolidated since November&nbsp;16, 2009, the
date of the additional share acquisition described above and in Note 4. The Company consolidates
all of Bluegreen&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities in which Bluegreen holds a controlling
financial interest. The Company also consolidates Bluegreen&#146;s non-wholly owned subsidiary,
Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations, LLC (the &#147;Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture&#148;), as Bluegreen holds a
51% equity interest in the Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture, has an active role as the day-to-day
manager of the Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture&#146;s activities, and has majority voting control of
the Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture&#146;s management committee.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008, Woodbridge, indirectly through a wholly-owned subsidiary, made a $3.0&nbsp;million
investment in Pizza Fusion. Pizza Fusion was determined to be a VIE under the provisions of the
accounting guidance for consolidation of variable interest entities and Woodbridge&#146;s wholly-owned
subsidiary was determined to be the primary beneficiary. Therefore, the Company consolidated Pizza
Fusion into its consolidated financial statements as of September&nbsp;18, 2008. Woodbridge has
subsequently made additional investments in Pizza Fusion totaling $1.0&nbsp;million.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;1, 2010, BFC, Bluegreen and BankAtlantic Bancorp adopted an amendment to the
accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets and an amendment to the accounting guidance
associated with the
consolidation of VIEs. As a result of the adoption of these accounting standards, Bluegreen
consolidated seven existing special purpose finance entities (&#147;QSPEs&#148;) associated with prior
securitization transactions which previously qualified</DIV>

revised financial statement presentation for 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2009, Core Communities reinitiated efforts to sell two of its commercial leasing
projects (the &#147;Projects&#148;) and began soliciting bids from several potential buyers to purchase
assets associated with the Projects. Due to this decision, the assets associated with the
Projects were reclassified as assets held for sale and the liabilities related to these assets were
reclassified as liabilities related to assets held for sale in the Consolidated Statements of
Financial Condition. Additionally, the results of operations for the Projects are included in the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Operations in discontinued operations for all the periods
presented. On June&nbsp;10, 2010, Core sold the Projects for approximately $75.4&nbsp;million. As a result of
the sale, a $2.6&nbsp;million gain on sale of discontinued operations was realized in 2010. See Note 6
for further information.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;28, 2007, BankAtlantic Bancorp completed the sale to Stifel Financial Corp
(&#147;Stifel&#148;) of Ryan Beck Holdings, Inc. (&#147;Ryan Beck&#148;), a subsidiary of BankAtlantic Bancorp engaged
in retail and institutional brokerage and investment banking. Discontinued operations in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 included liabilities
recognized for indemnification obligations under the acquisition agreement. Discontinued
operations for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 included earn-out consideration received
in accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement net of indemnification obligations. See
Note 6 for further information.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary </I></B><I>&#151; </I>Under the accounting guidance for
consolidation, consolidation of a majority-owned subsidiary is precluded where control does not
rest with the majority owners. Under these rules, legal reorganization or bankruptcy represents
conditions which can preclude consolidation or equity method accounting as control rests with the
bankruptcy court, rather than the majority owner. As described elsewhere in this report in Note 27,
Levitt and Sons declared bankruptcy on November&nbsp;9, 2007. Therefore, in accordance with the
accounting guidance for consolidation, Levitt and Sons was deconsolidated as of November&nbsp;9, 2007,
eliminating all future operations of Levitt and Sons from the Company&#146;s financial results of
operations, and the Company followed the cost method of accounting to record its interest in Levitt
and Sons.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During June&nbsp;2008, Woodbridge entered into a settlement agreement (the &#147;Settlement Agreement&#148;) with
the Debtors and the Joint Committee of Unsecured Creditors appointed in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases (&#147;the
Joint Committee&#148;). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, as it was subsequently amended, Woodbridge
agreed to (i)&nbsp;pay $8&nbsp;million to the Debtors&#146; Estate, (ii)&nbsp;place $4.5&nbsp;million in a release fund to
be disbursed to third party creditors in exchange for a third party release and injunction, (iii)
make a $300,000 payment to a deposit holders fund and (iv)&nbsp;share a percentage of any tax refund
attributable to periods prior to the bankruptcy with the Debtors&#146; Estate. In addition, Woodbridge
agreed to waive and release substantially all of the claims it had against the Debtors, including
administrative expense claims through July&nbsp;2008, and the Debtors (joined by the Joint Committee)
agreed to waive and release any claims they had against Woodbridge and its affiliates. On February
20, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming a plan of liquidation jointly proposed
by Levitt and Sons and the Joint Committee. That order also approved the settlement pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement, as amended. No appeal or rehearing of the court&#146;s order was filed by any
party, and the settlement was consummated on March&nbsp;3, 2009, at which time payment was made in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement, as amended. Under cost
method accounting, the cost of settlement and the related $52.9&nbsp;million liability (less $500,000
which was determined as the settlement holdback and remained as an accrual pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement) was recognized into income in the first quarter of 2009, resulting in a $40.4
million gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we
accrued $10.7&nbsp;million in connection with the portion of the tax refund required to be paid to the
Debtors&#146; Estate pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and as a result the gain on settlement of
investment in Woodbridge&#146;s subsidiary for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 was $29.7&nbsp;million, net
of the tax refund. Additionally, in 2010, we increased the $10.7&nbsp;million accrual by approximately
$1.0&nbsp;million, representing the portion of an additional tax refund which we expect to receive due
to a recent change in Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) guidance that will likely be required to be
paid to the Debtors&#146; Estate pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The $1.0&nbsp;million accrual was
recorded in the (loss)&nbsp;gain on settlement of investment in Woodbridge&#146;s subsidiary. As of December
31, 2010, we have a liability of approximately
$11.7&nbsp;million, representing the portion of the tax refunds to be shared with the Debtors&#146; Estate

gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary</I></B> &#151; During November&nbsp;2010, Core entered into a settlement agreement with one of its lenders, which
had previously commenced actions seeking foreclosure of mortgage loans totaling approximately
$113.9&nbsp;million collateralized by property in Florida and South Carolina. Under the terms of the
agreement, Core pledged additional collateral to the lender consisting of membership interests in
five of Core&#146;s subsidiaries and granted security interests in the acreage owned by such
subsidiaries in Port St. Lucie, Florida, substantially all of which is undeveloped raw land. Core
also agreed to an amendment of the complaint related to the Florida foreclosure action to include
this additional collateral and an entry into consensual judgments of foreclosure in both the
Florida and South Carolina foreclosure actions. In consideration therefore the lender agreed not to
enforce a deficiency judgment against Core and, during February&nbsp;2011,released Core from any other
claims arising from or relating to the loans. As of November&nbsp;30, 2010, Core deconsolidated the
five subsidiaries, the membership interests in which were transferred to the lender upon entry into
the consensual judgments of foreclosure. In connection therewith and in accordance with accounting
guidance for consolidation, a guarantee obligation &#147;deferred gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary&#148;
of $11.3&nbsp;million was recorded and is included in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Financial
Condition as of December&nbsp;31, 2010. The deferred gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary was
recognized into income in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations at the time Core
received its general release of liability in February&nbsp;2011.</DIV>

on Debt Extinguishment </I></B>&#151; In December&nbsp;2010, Core and one of its subsidiaries entered
agreements, including without limitation, a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure Agreement, with one of
their lenders which resolved the foreclosure proceedings commenced by the lender related to
property at Tradition Hilton Head which served as collateral for a $25&nbsp;million loan. Pursuant to
the agreements, Core&#146;s subsidiary transferred to the lender all of its right, title and interest in
and to the property which served as collateral for the loan as well as certain additional real and
personal property. In consideration therefore the lender released Core and its subsidiary from any
claims arising from or relating to the loan. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance,
this transaction was accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring, and a $13.0&nbsp;million gain on

financial institutions located throughout the United States, Canada and Aruba and exceed federally
insured amounts. However, the Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts and periodic
evaluations of the relative credit standing of financial institutions maintaining the Company&#146;s

assessed real estate taxes are delinquent. Tax certificates are acquired from municipalities
generally through public auction. Tax certificates are carried at cost less an allowance for tax
certificate losses. Tax certificates and resulting deeds are classified as non-accrual when a tax
certificate is 24 to 60&nbsp;months, depending on the municipality, from the acquisition date. At that
time, interest ceases to be accrued.</DIV>

establishing its allowance for tax certificate losses, management considers past loss experience,

conditions and collateral values.</DIV>

balances net of any unearned income, unamortized deferred fees or costs, premiums or discounts and
an allowance for loan losses. Loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are deferred

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance consists of two components. The first component of the allowance is for loans
that are individually evaluated for impairment. The process for identifying loans to be evaluated
individually for impairment is based on management&#146;s identification of criticized loans for
commercial real estate, commercial non-real estate and small business loans. The evaluation of
commercial real estate, commercial non-real estate and small business loans is
part of the on-going monitoring of loan portfolio credit quality and management assigns these
loans a risk classification.</DIV>

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There are seven risk classifications in the &#147;Pass&#148; loan categories and there are four
classifications in the criticized loan categories which are defined based on regulatory guidelines.
Management evaluates criticized commercial real estate, commercial non-real estate and small
business loans greater than $1.0&nbsp;million for impairment quarterly. Once an individual loan is
found to be impaired, an evaluation is performed to determine if a specific reserve needs to be
assigned to the loan based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
loan&#146;s effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, impairment may be measured
based on the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is
collateral dependent. Loans determined to be collateral dependent are measured based on the fair
value of the collateral less costs to sell. Consumer and residential loans past due 120&nbsp;days or
more were also evaluated individually for impairment to determine if a specific reserve needs to be
assigned to the loan by comparing the carrying amount or to the estimated fair value of the loan&#146;s
collateral less cost to sell.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second component of the allowance is for groups of loans with common characteristics that
are evaluated in loan pools to estimate the inherent losses in the portfolio. Management of
BankAtlantic Bancorp segregates loans into segments with certain common characteristics so as to
form a basis for estimating losses as it relates to segment. The loan portfolio has the following
loan segments: residential, consumer, commercial non-real estate, commercial real estate, and
small business loans. The loss experience for each loan segment was derived by calculating a
charge-off history by loan segment adjusted by an expected recovery rate. Based on the nature of
each portfolio, a time frame is selected for the charge-off history in order to estimate the
inherent loss in each segment. The loss factor that was calculated from the charge-off history by
loan segment is adjusted by considering the following factors: delinquency and charge-off levels
and trends; non-accrual levels and trends; lending policy and underwriting procedures; lending
management and staff; nature and volume of portfolio; economic and business conditions;
concentration of credit; quality of loan review system; and external factors. Based on an
analysis of the above factors, management may adjust the historical loss experience up or down to
reflect current conditions that differ from the conditions that existed during the historical loss
experience time frame.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Allowance for Loan Losses on VOI Notes Receivable</I></B><I>. </I>Bluegreen records an estimate of expected
uncollectibility on its VOI notes receivable as a reduction of revenue at the time it recognizes a
timeshare sale. Bluegreen estimates uncollectible VOI notes receivable based on historical
uncollectibles for similar VOI notes receivable over the applicable historical period, using a
technique referred to as static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each year&#146;s sales
over the entire life of those notes.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Non-accrual
and past due loans &#151; </I></B>Loans are considered past due if the required principal and
interest have not been received based on the contractual terms of the loan. Loans are generally
placed on non-accrual status at the earlier of the loan becoming 90&nbsp;days past due as to either
principal or interest or when the borrower has entered bankruptcy proceedings and the loan is
delinquent. Commercial and small business loans may be placed on non-accrual status sooner due to
material deterioration of conditions surrounding the repayment sources, which could include
insufficient borrower capacity to service the debt, significantly delayed property sales or
development schedules, declines in the loan-to-value of the loan&#146;s collateral or other factors
causing the full payment of the loan&#146;s principal and interest to be in doubt. Accordingly,
BankAtlantic Bancorp may place a loan on non-accrual status even when payments of principal or
interest are not currently in default. However, exceptions to this policy may occur if there exists
well secured collateral and the loan is in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on
non-accrual, all accrued interest is reversed against interest income. Any payments received on
non-accrual loans are applied against principal. Commercial and small business loans may be
restored to accrual status when there has been a satisfactory period of performance and the loan is
expected to perform in the future according to its contractual terms. Residential and consumer
loans are returned to accrual status when the loan becomes less than 90&nbsp;days past due. Commercial
and small business loans are charged-off if the collection of principal or interest is considered
doubtful. Consumer and residential real estate loans that are 120&nbsp;days past due are charged down or
a specific valuation allowance is established based on the collateral&#146;s fair value less estimated
selling costs. Consumer non-mortgage loans that are 120&nbsp;days past due are charged off.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Loans Held for Sale </I></B>&#151; Loans held for sale are reported at the lower of aggregate cost or
estimated fair value. Loan origination fees and related direct loan origination costs on loans
held for sale and premiums and discounts on purchased loans held for sale are deferred until the
related loan is sold and included in gains and losses upon sale.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Notes Receivable &#151; </I></B>Bluegreen&#146;s notes receivable are carried at amortized cost less an
allowance for bad debts. Interest income is suspended and previously accrued but unpaid interest
income is reversed on all delinquent notes receivable when principal or interest payments are more
than three months contractually past due and not resumed until
such loans are less than three months past due. Notes receivable are generally charged off as
uncollectible when they have become approximately 120&nbsp;days past due.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncollectibles for vacation ownership interests (&#147;VOI&#148;) notes receivable are estimated in
accordance with timeshare accounting rules. Under these rules, the estimate of uncollectibles is
based on historical uncollectibles for similar VOI notes receivable over the applicable historical
period. Bluegreen uses a static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each year&#146;s sales
over the entire life of the notes. Bluegreen also considers whether the historical economic
conditions are comparable to current economic conditions, as well as variations in underwriting
standards. Additionally, under timeshare accounting rules no consideration is given for future
recoveries of defaulted inventory in the estimate of uncollectible VOI notes receivable. Bluegreen
reviews its reserve for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis. Loan origination costs are
deferred and recognized over the life of the related notes receivable.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen estimates credit losses on its notes receivable portfolios generated in connection
with the sale of homesites in accordance with the accounting rules for contingencies<I>, </I>as its notes
receivable portfolios consist of large groups of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans. Under these
accounting rules, the amount of loss is reduced by the estimated value of the defaulted inventory
to be recovered.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Acquired
Notes Receivable </I></B>&#151; As part of the Bluegreen share acquisition, the Company acquired
assets including a pool of notes receivable consisting principally of homogenous consumer timeshare
loans originated by Bluegreen. Consistent with the accounting guidance, the Company has elected an
accounting policy based on expected cash flows including, following the guidance on maintaining the
integrity of a pool of multiple loans accounted for as a single asset. The loans have common risk
characteristics as defined in the accounting guidance <I>Loans and Debt Securities with Deteriorated
Credit Quality, </I>including similar risk ratings, as defined and monitored by risk rating agencies,
term, purpose and similar collateral type (Vacation Ownership Interests (&#147;VOI&#146;s&#148;)). The Company
evaluates the pool of loans accounted for as a single asset for indications of further impairment.
Purchased loans are considered to be impaired if the Company does not expect to receive all
contractually required cash flows due to concerns about credit quality. The excess of the cash
flows expected to be collected measured as of the acquisition date, over the estimated fair value
is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized into interest income over the remaining
life of the loan using a level yield methodology. The difference between contractually required
payments as of the acquisition date and the cash flows expected to be collected is referred to as
the nonaccretable difference.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent decreases to expected principal cash flows result in a charge to provision for
credit losses and a corresponding increase to a valuation allowance included in the allowance for
loan losses. Subsequent increases in expected principal cash flows result in a recovery of any
previously recorded allowance for loan losses, to the extent applicable, and a reclassification
from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield for any remaining increase. Changes in expected
interest cash flows may result in reclassifications to/from the nonaccretable difference. Loan
disposals, which may include receipt of payments in full from the borrower or foreclosure, result
in removal of the loan from the loan pool at its allocated carrying amount.</DIV>

originated by its vacation ownership business in connection with the sale of VOIs. In connection
with such transactions, Bluegreen retains interest in the notes receivable sold. Prior to the
adoption of Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2009-17, these retained interests were reported as
assets and treated as available-for-sale investments and, accordingly, carried at fair value.
Changes in the fair values of the retained interests in notes receivable sold considered temporary
were included in its shareholders&#146; equity as accumulated other comprehensive income, net of income
taxes. The portion of other-than-temporary declines in fair value that represented credit losses
were charged to operations.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2009-17 Bluegreen consolidated special purpose finance
entities associated with prior securitization transactions that previously qualified for
off-balance-sheet sales treatment and as a result, the retained interests were eliminated. See
Note 5 for additional information related to the impact of the adoption of ASU 2009-17.</DIV>

to the allowance for loan losses or allowance for tax certificates losses. Expenditures for
capital improvements are generally capitalized. Valuation allowance adjustments are made to reflect
any subsequent declines in fair values. The costs of holding REO are charged to operations as
incurred. Provisions and reversals in the REO valuation allowance are reflected in operations.</DIV>

holdings at Core and Carolina Oak, Bluegreen Resorts and Bluegreen Communities. Inventory at Core
and Carolina Oak is stated at the lower of accumulated cost or estimated fair value less cost to
sell and consists of land, land development costs, interest costs and other construction costs. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2010, with the exception of certain assets within Tradition Hilton Head, the
operations of Core have been deconsolidated. See Note 2 and 14 for further detail.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen&#146;s inventory is comprised of (i)&nbsp;in the Bluegreen Resorts segment, completed real
estate-based VOIs, VOIs under construction and land held for future vacation ownership development
and (ii)&nbsp;in the Bluegreen Communities segment, residential land acquired or developed for sale.
Bluegreen carries its completed inventory at the lower of i) cost, including costs of improvements
and amenities incurred subsequent to acquisition, capitalized interest, real estate taxes plus
other costs incurred during construction, or ii) estimated fair value, less costs to sell. VOI
inventory and cost of sales is accounted for under the provisions of timeshare accounting rules,
which defines a specific method of the relative sales value method for relieving VOI inventory and
recording cost of sales. Under the relative sales value method required by timeshare accounting
rules, cost of sales is calculated as a percentage of net sales using a cost-of-sales
percentage&#151;the ratio of total estimated development cost to total estimated VOI revenue, including
the estimated incremental revenue from the resale of VOI inventory repossessed, generally as a
result of the default of the related receivable. Also, pursuant to timeshare accounting rules,
Bluegreen does not relieve inventory for VOI cost of sales related to anticipated credit losses
(accordingly, no adjustment is made when inventory is reacquired upon default of the related
receivable). For Bluegreen Communities real estate projects, costs are allocated to individual
home sites in the projects based on the relative estimated sales value of each home site in
accordance with the accounting guidance for real estate, which defines the accounting for costs of
real estate projects. Under this method, the allocated cost of a unit is relieved from inventory
and recognized as cost of sales upon recognition of the related sale. Home sites reacquired upon
default of the related receivable are considered held for sale and are recorded at fair value less
costs to sell.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen periodically evaluates the recovery of the carrying amount of incomplete or
undeveloped resort and residential communities&#146; properties under the accounting guidelines for
Property, Plant and Equipment, which provides guidance relating to the accounting for the
impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. During 2010, Bluegreen recorded $14.9&nbsp;million in
impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of inventory related to certain developed and
undeveloped phases of its residential communities. See Note 14 for further discussion.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real estate inventory also includes BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s investment in a real estate
development and land acquired for branch expansion that BankAtlantic Bancorp has committed to sell.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Capitalized Interest &#151; </I></B>Interest incurred relating to land under development and
construction is capitalized to real estate inventory or property and equipment during the active
development period. For inventory, interest is capitalized at the effective rates paid on
borrowings during the pre-construction and planning stages and the periods that projects are under
development. Capitalization of interest is discontinued if development ceases at a project.
Capitalized interest is expensed as a component of cost of sales as related homes, land and units
are sold. For property and equipment under construction, interest associated with these assets is
capitalized as incurred to property and equipment and is expensed through depreciation once the
asset is put into use.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Impairment
of Long Lived Assets </I></B>&#151; Long-lived assets consist of real estate inventory, property
and equipment and other amortizable intangible assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the
carrying amount of an asset to estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by
the asset, or by using appraisals of the related assets. Using estimated future undiscounted cash
flows or appraisals requires significant judgment and opinions in developing estimates. Real estate
may also be valued using third party offers to purchase, discounted cash flows or broker price
opinions. Appraisals generally use the market approach valuation technique and use market
observable data to formulate an opinion of the fair value of the properties. However, the appraiser
or brokers use professional judgment in determining the fair value of the properties, and the
Company may also adjust these values for changes in market conditions subsequent to the valuation
date when current
appraisals are not available. As a consequence of using discounted cash flows, broker price
opinions, offers to purchase and adjustments to appraisals, the fair values of the properties use
Level 3 inputs in the determination of fair value.

useful life. An impairment loss is recognized at the date a long-lived asset is exchanged for a

to record its interests in entities in which it does not own the majority of the voting stock and
to record its investment in variable interest entities in which it is not the primary
beneficiary. Under the equity method, the initial investment in the entity is recorded at cost and
is subsequently adjusted to recognize the Company&#146;s share of the entity&#146;s earnings or losses.
Distributions received and other-than temporary impairments reduce the carrying amount of the
investment.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company reviews its equity and cost method investments quarterly for indicators of
other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment in which the
Company evaluates, among other factors, the fair market value of the investments, general market
conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than cost,
and the Company&#146;s intent and ability to hold the investment until it recovers. The Company also
considers specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for
the investee, including industry and sector performance, rating agency actions, changes in
operations and financing cash flow factors. If a decline in the fair value of the investment is
determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the investment to
its fair value and a new cost basis in the investment is established.</DIV>

leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, equipment and computer software, golf course land
and water treatment and irrigation facilities, and are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Land is carried at cost. Depreciation is primarily computed on the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which generally range up to 40&nbsp;years for
buildings, from 3 to 11&nbsp;years for office equipment, furniture and fixtures and up to 39&nbsp;years for
golf course land improvements. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized using the
straight-line method over the shorter of the terms of the related leases or the useful lives of the
assets. Interest expense associated with the construction of certain fixed assets is capitalized as
incurred and relieved to expense through depreciation once the asset is put into use. Direct costs
associated with development of internal-use software are capitalized and amortized over 3 to 5
years. In cases where the Company determines that land and the related development costs are to be
used as fixed assets, these costs are transferred from inventory of real estate to property and
equipment.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditures for new properties, leasehold improvements and equipment and major renewals and
betterments are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, and

Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually or at interim
periods if events occur that might result in a decline in the fair value of the reporting unit.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill testing is a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is
used to identify potential impairment. This step compares the fair value of the reporting unit
with its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value,
goodwill is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary.
If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, then the second step of
the test is used to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, in the reporting unit. This
step compares the current implied goodwill in the reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the
carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the
implied goodwill, impairment is recorded for the excess. The implied goodwill is determined in the
same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined.</DIV>

statements as a result of the November&nbsp;16, 2009 acquisition of additional Bluegreen shares. Such
management contracts have indefinite useful lives and are not amortized, but instead are reviewed
for impairment on at least an annual basis, or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. At December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, other
intangible assets also consist of core deposit intangible assets of approximately $12.7&nbsp;million and
$16.2&nbsp;million, respectively, which were initially recorded at fair value and then amortized over
the average life of the respective assets, ranging from 7&nbsp;years to 10&nbsp;years.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company evaluates the recovery of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets under
applicable accounting guidance which requires that intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
lives not be amortized, but rather be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis or when
events and circumstances indicate that assets may be impaired and when the undiscounted cash flows
estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. The carrying value
of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings. If cash flows decrease
significantly, intangible assets may be impaired and would be written down to their fair value. The
estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require the Company to make significant judgments
regarding future periods that are subject to outside factors.</DIV>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s revenue and all related costs and expenses from house and land sales are
recognized at the time that closing has occurred, when title and possession of the property and the
risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the buyer, and when the Company does not have a
substantial continuing involvement in accordance with the accounting guidance for sales of real
estate. In order to properly match revenues with expenses, the Company estimates construction and
land development costs incurred and to be incurred, but not paid at the time of closing. Estimated
costs to complete are determined for each closed home and land sale based upon historical data with
respect to similar product types and geographical areas and allocated to closings along with actual
costs incurred based on a relative sales value approach. To the extent the estimated costs to
complete have significantly changed, the Company will adjust cost of sales in the current period
for the impact on cost of sales of previously sold homes and land to ensure a consistent margin of
sales is maintained.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue is recognized for certain land sales on the percentage-of-completion method when the
land sale takes place prior to all contracted work being completed. Pursuant to the requirements
of the accounting guidance for sales of real estate, if the seller has some continuing involvement
with the property and does not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership,
profit shall be recognized by a method determined by the nature and extent of the seller&#146;s
continuing involvement. In the case of land sales, this involvement typically consists of final
development activities. The Company recognizes revenue and related costs as work progresses using
the percentage of completion method, which relies on estimates of total expected costs to complete
required work. Revenue is recognized in proportion to the percentage of total costs incurred in
relation to estimated total costs at the time of sale. Actual revenues and costs to complete
construction in the future could differ from current estimates. If the estimates of development
costs remaining to be completed are significantly different from actual amounts, then the revenues,
related cumulative profits and costs of sales may be revised in the period that estimates change.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s other revenues consist primarily of rental property income, marketing revenues,
irrigation service fees, and title and mortgage revenue. Irrigation service connection fees are
deferred and recognized systematically over the life of the irrigation plant. Irrigation usage fees
are recognized when billed as the service is performed. Rental property income consists of rent
revenue from long-term leases of commercial property. The Company reviews all new leases in
accordance with the accounting guidance for leases. If the lease contains fixed escalations for
rent, free-rent periods or upfront incentives, rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the life of the lease.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the requirements of the accounting guidance for real estate time-sharing
activities, Bluegreen recognizes revenue on VOI and home site sales when a minimum of 10% of the
sales price has been received in cash (demonstrating the buyer&#146;s commitment), the legal rescission
period has expired, collectability of the receivable representing the remainder of the sales price

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">reliable methodology to estimate the collectability of the receivables representing the remainder
of the sales price of real estate sold. See further discussion of Bluegreen&#146;s policies regarding
the estimation of credit losses on its notes receivable above. Should Bluegreen&#146;s estimates
regarding the collectability of its receivables change adversely, it may have to defer the
recognition of sales and its results of operations could be negatively impacted. Under the
provisions of timeshare accounting rules the calculation of the adequacy of a buyer&#146;s commitment
for the sale of VOIs requires that cash received towards the purchase of Bluegreen&#146;s VOIs be
reduced by the value of certain incentives provided to the buyer at the time of sale. If after
considering the value of the incentive the 10% requirement is not met, the VOI sale, and the
related cost and direct selling expenses, are deferred until such time that sufficient cash is
received from the customer, generally through receipt of mortgage payments. Changes to the
quantity, type, or value of sales incentives that Bluegreen provides to buyers of its VOIs may
result in additional VOI sales being deferred, and thus its results of operations could be
materially adversely impacted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where all development has not been completed, Bluegreen recognizes revenue in
accordance with the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Should Bluegreen&#146;s estimates of
the total anticipated cost of completing any of its Bluegreen Resorts&#146; or Bluegreen Communities&#146;
projects increase, it may be required to defer a greater amount of revenue or may be required to
defer revenue for a longer period of time, and thus its results of operations could be materially
adversely impacted.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contracts receivable included in other assets in the Company&#146;s consolidated statement of
financial condition consist of: (1)&nbsp;amounts receivable from customers on recent sales of VOIs
pending recording of the customers&#146; notes receivable in Bluegreen&#146;s loan servicing system; (2)
receivables related to unclosed home site sales; and, (3)&nbsp;receivables from third-party escrow
agents on recently closed home site sales.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under timeshare accounting rules, rental operations, including accommodations provided through
the use of Bluegreen&#146;s Sampler program, are accounted for as incidental operations whereby
incremental carrying costs in excess of incremental revenue are charged to expense as incurred.
Conversely, incremental revenue in excess of incremental carrying costs is recorded as a reduction
to VOI inventory. Incremental carrying costs include costs that have been incurred by Bluegreen
during the holding period of the unsold VOIs, such as developer subsidies and maintenance fees on
the unsold VOI inventory. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, all of Bluegreen&#146;s rental
revenue and sampler revenue earned in the Bluegreen Resorts segment were recorded as an off-set to
cost of other resort and communities operations as such amounts were less than the incremental
carrying cost.</DIV>

business combinations which significantly changed the accounting for business combinations. Under
this guidance, subject to limited exceptions, an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value.
Additionally, due diligence and transaction costs incurred to effect a business combination are
expensed as incurred, as opposed to being capitalized as part of the acquisition purchase price.
This guidance also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements. The Company
adopted this guidance on January&nbsp;1, 2009.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for its acquisitions in accordance with the accounting guidance for
business combinations. If the Company makes a &#147;bargain purchase&#148;, the Company recognizes a gain in
the income statement on the acquisition date. A bargain purchase is a business combination in which
the amounts of the identifiable net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, as measured on the
acquisition date in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations, exceeds the
aggregate of (i)&nbsp;the consideration transferred, as measured in accordance with the accounting
guidance, which generally requires acquisition date fair value; (ii)&nbsp;the fair value of any
non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and (iii)&nbsp;in a business combination achieved in stages,
the acquisition date fair value of the Company&#146;s previously held equity interest in the acquiree.
This allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions, including estimates of
future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets. The Company may utilize independent third
parties to assist the Company in assessing market conditions when appropriate. The Company is also
required to periodically review these judgments and estimates and adjust them accordingly. If
conditions change from those expected, it is possible that the results could change in future
periods. Certain identifiable intangible assets, such as management contracts, are not amortized,
but instead are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis, or if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company
accounted for the acquisition of a controlling interest in Bluegreen in November&nbsp;2009 as a bargain
purchase. Accordingly, judgments regarding the value of Bluegreen&#146;s assets and liabilities as of
the acquisition date have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on the Company&#146;s
operating results.</DIV>

that have not been terminated and have no economic benefit to the Company are measured at fair
value.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for income taxes is based on income before taxes reported for financial
statement purposes after adjustment for transactions that do not have tax consequences. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are realized according to the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates
as of the date of the statement of financial condition. The effect of a change in tax rates on
deferred tax assets and liabilities is reflected in the period that includes the statutory
enactment date. A deferred tax asset valuation allowance is recorded when it has been determined
that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. If a valuation
allowance is needed, a subsequent change in circumstances that causes a change in judgment about
the realization of the
related deferred tax amount could result in the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recognizes a liability for uncertain tax positions. An uncertain tax position is
defined as a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that is not based on clear and
unambiguous tax law and which is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and
liabilities for interim or annual periods. The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an
uncertain tax position only if it believes that it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the
position. The Company measures the tax benefits recognized based on the largest benefit that has a
greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Company recognizes
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income taxes.</DIV>

interest and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this guidance requires that a
noncontrolling interest (minority interest) be recognized as equity in the consolidated financial
statements and itemized separately from the parent&#146;s equity. This guidance also established
accounting and reporting standards for the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the
parent and to the noncontrolling interest and it also clarified that changes in a parent&#146;s
ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if
the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, this guidance required that a
parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or
loss is measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the
deconsolidation date. This guidance also included expanded disclosure requirements regarding the
interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. This guidance was effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December&nbsp;15, 2008. The
Company adopted this guidance on January&nbsp;1, 2009. Noncontrolling interests reflect third parties&#146;
ownership interests in entities that are consolidated and less than 100% owned.</DIV>

designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. These loans are
generally underwritten based on the identified cash flows of the borrower&#146;s business and
secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers,
however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Additionally, these borrowers are primarily located in Florida and adverse economic events in
Florida significantly impact the credit quality of this portfolio.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial real estate loans that are not land loans or commercial residential loans are
primarily underwritten based on the cash flow of the borrower&#146;s business and secondarily based on
the fair value of the underlying collateral. Commercial real estate lending typically involves
higher loan balances and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the
operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the
loan. Commercial real estate loans are adversely affected by downturns in the real estate markets
or in the general economy where the property is located. The properties securing the commercial
real estate portfolio are primarily located in Florida which increases the Company&#146;s exposure to
adverse economic events in Florida. BankAtlantic Bancorp monitors and evaluates commercial real
estate loans based on collateral, risk grades and debt service coverage. Commercial land and
commercial residential loans, which include builder land loans, land acquisition and development
loans and land, acquisition, development and construction loans, are generally loans to developers
and builders. These loans are generally underwritten based upon estimates of costs and value
associated with the completed project and the repayment of these loans is often dependent on the
success of the project. These loans are considered to have higher risks than other commercial real
estate loans, as repayment is based on the success of the real estate project as opposed to
established cash flows.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s residential loan portfolio consists primarily of purchased residential
first mortgages that were originated by other financial institutions. BankAtlantic Bancorp
purchases residential loans located throughout the country. The majority of these residential
loans are jumbo residential loans. A jumbo loan has a principal amount above the industry-standard
definition of conventional conforming loan limits. These loans could potentially have outstanding
loan balances significantly higher than related collateral values in distressed areas of the
country as a result of real estate value declines in the housing markets. Also included in this
purchased residential loan portfolio are interest-only loans. The structure of these loans results
in possible future increases in a borrower&#146;s loan payments when the contractually required
repayments change due to interest rate movement and the required amortization of the principal
amount. These payment increases could affect a borrower&#146;s ability to meet the debt service on or
repay the loan and lead to increased defaults and losses. Real estate values nationwide have
significantly declined since these loans were originated exposing BankAtlantic Bancorp to elevated
credit risk in this portfolio.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s consumer loan portfolio consists primarily of home equity loans with
the underlying collateral located in Florida. These loans were originated based primarily on
credit scores and secondarily loan to value ratios. These loans are primarily second mortgages
resulting in a limited ability to realize collateral value upon default. The default rates of
consumer home equity and residential loans are adversely affected by rising unemployment and
declining real estate values.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>New Accounting Standards</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;1, 2010, BFC, Bluegreen and BankAtlantic Bancorp adopted an amendment to the
accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets and an amendment to the accounting guidance
associated with the consolidation of VIEs. As a result of the adoption of these accounting
standards, Bluegreen consolidated seven existing special purpose finance entities associated with
prior securitization transactions that previously qualified for off-balance sheet sales treatment,
and BankAtlantic Bancorp consolidated its joint venture that conducts a factoring business.
Accordingly, Bluegreen&#146;s consolidated special purpose finance entities and BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
consolidated factoring joint venture are now consolidated in BFC&#146;s financial statements. The
consolidation of Bluegreen&#146;s special purpose finance entities resulted in a one-time non-cash
after-tax reduction to retained earnings of $2.4&nbsp;million and the following impacts to the Company&#146;s
Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at January&nbsp;1, 2010: (1)&nbsp;assets increased by $413.8
million, primarily representing the consolidation of notes receivable, net of allowance, partially
offset by the elimination of Bluegreen&#146;s retained interests; (2)&nbsp;liabilities increased by $416.7
million, primarily representing the consolidation of non-recourse debt obligations associated with
third parties, partially offset by the elimination of certain deferred tax liabilities; and
(3)&nbsp;total equity decreased by approximately $2.9&nbsp;million, including a decrease of approximately
$1.4&nbsp;million to noncontrolling interests (see Note 5 for further information). The
consolidation of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s factoring joint venture did not have any impact on our
consolidated financial statements other than a decrease in investments in unconsolidated
affiliates.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning with the period ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 new accounting guidance was implemented requiring
the following additional disclosure regarding fair value measurements: (1)&nbsp;transfers in and out of

Level 3 roll forward. The guidance also included clarifications to existing disclosure requirements
on the level of disaggregation and disclosures regarding inputs and valuation techniques. The
guidance is applicable to all disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements.
The effective date of the guidance was the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after
December&nbsp;15, 2009, except for the gross presentation of the Level 3 roll forward information, which
is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2010 and for interim
reporting periods within those years. The additional disclosures made in accordance with this new
guidance did not have a material effect on the Company&#146;s financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued new disclosure guidance about the &#147;Credit Quality of Financing
Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses.&#148; The new guidance requires enhanced disclosures
related to the credit quality of financing receivables which includes the Company&#146;s loans
receivable and the allowance for loan losses, and provides that new and existing disclosures should
be disaggregated based on how an entity develops its allowance for loan losses and how it manages
credit exposures. Under the new guidance, additional disclosures required for loans receivable
include information regarding the aging of past due receivables, credit quality indicators, and
troubled debt restructure modifications of financing receivables. The new guidance became effective
for periods ending after December&nbsp;15, 2010, with the exception of the amendments to the roll
forward of the allowance for credit losses which are effective for periods beginning after
December&nbsp;15, 2010. Disclosures about troubled debt restructured loans were deferred to coincide
with the effective date of a proposed accounting standards&#146; update related to troubled debt
restructurings, which is currently expected to be effective for periods ending after June&nbsp;15, 2011.
Comparative disclosures are required only for periods ending subsequent to initial adoption. The
additional disclosures made in accordance with the new guidance did not have a material effect on
the Company&#146;s financial statements.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued new disclosure guidance that modifies Step 1 of the goodwill
impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting
units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely
than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than not that
a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative
factors indicating that an impairment may exist such as the occurrence of an event or change in
circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying amount. The new accounting guidance was effective for the Company on January&nbsp;1, 2011 and
the Company believes that the new guidance will not have a material effect on the Company&#146;s
financial statements</DIV>

received as a result of tax law changes, short-term investments, and dividends from Benihana. As
discussed elsewhere in this report, we also expect to receive an additional $10.8&nbsp;million tax

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2007, Woodbridge acquired from Levitt and Sons LLC, a former wholly-owned subsidiary of
Woodbridge (&#147;Levitt and Sons&#148;), all of the outstanding membership interests in Carolina Oak, a
South Carolina limited liability company (formerly known as Levitt and Sons of Jasper County, LLC).
As a result of the significant challenges faced during 2009, Woodbridge made the decision to cease
all activities at Carolina Oak. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the inventory of real estate at
Carolina Oak was reviewed for impairment and a $16.7&nbsp;million impairment charge was recorded to
adjust the carrying amount of Carolina Oak&#146;s inventory to its fair value of $10.8&nbsp;million.
Woodbridge is the obligor under a $37.2&nbsp;million loan that is collateralized by the Carolina Oak
property. During 2009, the lender declared the loan to be in default and filed an action for
foreclosure. While there may have been an issue with respect to compliance with certain covenants
in the loan documents, we do not believe that an event of default occurred. Through participation
in a court-ordered mediation of this matter, the parties agreed to tentative terms to settle the
matter and are currently negotiating a formal settlement agreement. It is currently expected that
this settlement agreement, if finalized, will provide for (i)&nbsp;Woodbridge to pay $2.5&nbsp;million to the
investor group, (ii)&nbsp;Carolina Oak to convey to the investor group the real property securing the
loan via a stipulated foreclosure or deed in lieu, (iii)&nbsp;the investor group to release Woodbridge
and Carolina Oak from their obligations relating to the debt or, alternatively, to agree not to
pursue certain remedies, including a deficiency judgment, that would otherwise be available to
them, in each case subject to certain conditions, and (iv)&nbsp;the litigation to be dismissed. There is
no assurance that the settlement will be finalized on the contemplated terms, or at all.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, under Florida law, holders of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock who
did not vote to approve the merger between Woodbridge and BFC and properly asserted and exercised
their appraisal rights with respect to their shares (&#147;Dissenting Holders&#148;) are entitled to receive
a cash payment in an amount equal to the fair value of their shares as determined in accordance
with the provisions of Florida law in lieu of the shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock that they
would otherwise have been entitled to receive. Dissenting Holders, who collectively held
approximately 4.2&nbsp;million shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, have rejected Woodbridge&#146;s
offer of $1.10 per share and requested payment for their shares based on their respective fair
value estimates of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. Woodbridge is currently a party to legal
proceedings relating to the Dissenting Holders appraisal
process. In December&nbsp;2009, a $4.6&nbsp;million liability was recorded with a corresponding
reduction to additional paid-in capital, which is reflected in the Company&#146;s Consolidated

is currently ongoing and its outcome is uncertain. As a result, there is no assurance as to the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U><B><I>Core Communities </I></B></U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, the activities of Core Communities focused on the development of a
master-planned community in Port St. Lucie, Florida called Tradition, Florida and a community
outside of Hardeeville, South Carolina called Tradition Hilton Head. Until 2009, Tradition,
Florida was in active development as was Tradition Hilton Head, although in a much earlier stage.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2010, demand for residential and commercial inventory showed no signs of recovery,
particularly in the geographic regions where Core&#146;s properties are located. In early 2010,
Woodbridge made the decision to pursue an orderly liquidation of Core and worked cooperatively with
the various lenders to achieve that objective. During November&nbsp;2010, Core entered into a
settlement agreement with one of its lenders, which had previously commenced actions seeking
foreclosure of mortgage loans totaling approximately $113.9&nbsp;million collateralized by property in
Florida and South Carolina. Under the terms of the agreement, Core pledged additional collateral to
the lender consisting of membership interests in five of Core&#146;s subsidiaries and granted security
interests in the acreage owned by such subsidiaries in Port St. Lucie, Florida, substantially all
of which is undeveloped raw land. Core also agreed to an amendment of the complaint related to the
Florida foreclosure action to include this additional collateral and an entry into consensual
judgments of foreclosure in both the Florida and South Carolina foreclosure actions. In
consideration therefore, the lender agreed not to enforce a
deficiency judgment against Core and, in February 2011, released Core from any other claims arising from or relating to the loans. As of November&nbsp;30, 2010,
Core deconsolidated the five subsidiaries, the membership interests in which were transferred to
the lender upon entry into the consensual judgments of foreclosure. In connection therewith and
in accordance with the accounting guidance for consolidation, Woodbridge recorded a guarantee
obligation &#147;deferred gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary&#148; of $11.3&nbsp;million in the Company&#146;s
Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as of December&nbsp;31, 2010. The deferred gain on settlement of
investment in subsidiary was recognized into income in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of
Operations at the time Core received its general release of liability in February&nbsp;2011.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2010, Core and one of its subsidiaries entered agreements, including without
limitation, a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure Agreement, with one of their lenders which resolved the
foreclosure proceedings commenced by the lender related to property at Tradition Hilton Head which
served as collateral for a $25&nbsp;million loan. Pursuant to the agreements, Core&#146;s subsidiary
transferred to the lender all of its right, title and interest in and to the property which served
as collateral for the loan as well as certain additional real and personal property. In
consideration therefore, the lender released Core and its subsidiary from any claims arising from
or relating to the loan. In accordance with the accounting guidance, this transaction was
accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring and accordingly, a $13.0&nbsp;million gain on debt
extinguishment was recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;10, 2010, Core sold its two commercial leasing projects referred to as &#147;the Projects&#148;
to Inland Real Estate Acquisition, Inc. (&#147;Inland&#148;) for approximately $75.4&nbsp;million. As a result of
the sale, Core realized a gain on sale of discontinued operations of approximately $2.6&nbsp;million in
the second quarter of 2010. The sale resulted in net cash proceeds to Core of approximately $1.5
million. See Note 6 for further information regarding the Projects.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Order&#148; and the Company Order and Bank Order are referred collectively to as the &#147;Orders.&#148; The OTS
issued the Orders due to BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s losses over the past three years, high levels of
classified assets and inadequate levels of capital based on BankAtlantic&#146;s risk profile as
determined by the OTS&#146;s recent examination. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company is required to
submit updated written plans by March&nbsp;31, 2011 to the OTS that will address, among other things,
how BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company intends to maintain and enhance its and BankAtlantic&#146;s
capital and set forth BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company&#146;s business plan for the year ending
December&nbsp;31, 2011. In addition, under the terms of the Company Order, BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent
Company is prohibited from taking certain actions without receiving the prior written non-objection
of the OTS, including, without limitation, declaring or paying any dividends or other capital
distributions and incurring certain indebtedness. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company is also
required to ensure BankAtlantic&#146;s compliance with the terms of the Bank Order as well as all
applicable laws, rules, regulations and agency guidance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the terms of the Bank Order, BankAtlantic is required to attain by June&nbsp;30, 2011
and maintain a tier 1 (core)&nbsp;capital ratio equal to or greater than 8% and a total risk-based
capital ratio equal to or greater than 14%. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic had a tier 1 (core)
capital ratio of 6.22% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 11.72%. Under the terms of the Bank
Order, BankAtlantic is required to, among other things, revise certain of its plans, programs and
policies and submit to the OTS certain written plans, including a capital plan, a revised business
plan and a plan to reduce BankAtlantic&#146;s delinquent loans and non-performing assets. If
BankAtlantic fails to comply with the capital plan and/or fails to attain and maintain the
increased capital ratio requirements, or upon any written request from the OTS, BankAtlantic is
required to submit a contingency plan, which must detail actions which BankAtlantic would, in its
case, take to either merge with or be acquired by another banking institution. BankAtlantic will
not be required to implement such contingency plan until such time as it receives written
notification from the OTS to do so. In addition, the Bank Order requires BankAtlantic to limit its
asset growth and restricts BankAtlantic from originating or purchasing new commercial real estate
loans or entering into certain material agreements, in each case without receiving the prior
written non-objection of the OTS. Separately, the OTS has confirmed that it has no objection to
BankAtlantic originating loans to facilitate the sale of certain assets or the renewal, extension
or modification of existing commercial real estate loans, subject in each case to compliance with
applicable regulations and bank policies. The Bank Order prohibits the payment of dividends and
other distributions without the prior written non-objection of the OTS. The Orders also include
certain restrictions on compensation paid to the senior executive officers of BankAtlantic Bancorp
Parent Company and BankAtlantic, and restrictions on agreements with affiliates.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company and BankAtlantic will seek to meet the higher capital
requirements of the Bank Order through the estimated net gain upon consummation of its Tampa branch
sale anticipated to close June&nbsp;2011, subject to regulatory approvals and customary conditions and
through other efforts that may include the issuance of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
through a public or private offering. BankAtlantic is also pursuing other initiatives to improve
its regulatory capital position, including operating strategies to increase revenues and to reduce
non-interest expenses, asset balances and non-performing loans. There can be no assurance that
BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company or BankAtlantic will be able to execute such strategies in
order to meet BankAtlantic&#146;s new minimum regulatory capital levels by the required time frames.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Order became effective on February&nbsp;23, 2011 and will remain in effect until terminated,
modified or suspended by the OTS. No fines or penalties were imposed in connection with either
Order. While the Orders formalize steps that BankAtlantic Bancorp believes are already underway,
any material failure by BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company or BankAtlantic to comply with the
terms of the Orders, or if unanticipated market factors emerge, and/or if BankAtlantic Bancorp is
unable to raise required additional capital, successfully execute its plans, or comply with other
regulatory requirements, then the OTS could take further action, which could include the
imposition of fines, and/or additional enforcement actions. Enforcement actions available to
regulators include the issuance of a capital directive, removal of officers and/or directors,
institution of proceedings for receivership or conservatorship, require dissolution or liquidation
and terminate deposit insurance. Any such action would have a material adverse effect on
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s business, results of operations and financial position.</DIV>

the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 were $6.4&nbsp;million. BankAtlantic&#146;s liquidity is dependent, in
part, on its ability to maintain or increase deposit levels and the availability of its lines of
credit borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#147;FHLB&#148;), as well as the Treasury and Federal
Reserve lending programs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic had $558.8&nbsp;million in cash and short-term investments
and approximately $843&nbsp;million of available unused borrowings, consisting of $612&nbsp;million of unused
FHLB line of credit capacity, $195&nbsp;million of unpledged securities, and $36&nbsp;million of available
borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve. However, such available borrowings are subject to
regular reviews and may be terminated, suspended or reduced at any time at the discretion of the
issuing institution or based on the availability of qualifying collateral. Additionally, interest
rate changes, additional collateral requirements, disruptions in the capital markets, adverse
litigation or regulatory actions, or deterioration in BankAtlantic&#146;s financial condition may reduce
the amounts it is able to borrow, make borrowings unavailable or make terms of the borrowings and
deposits less favorable. As a result, BankAtlantic&#146;s cost of funds could increase and the
availability of funding sources could decrease. Based on current and expected liquidity needs and
sources, BankAtlantic Bancorp expects to be able to meet its obligations at least through
December&nbsp;31, 2011.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>3. Woodbridge Merger</B>
</DIV>
<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, Woodbridge Holdings Corporation and BFC consummated their merger,
pursuant to which Woodbridge Holdings Corporation merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of
BFC. Upon the effectiveness of the merger, the subsidiary was re-named Woodbridge Holdings, LLC,
and Woodbridge Holdings, LLC continued as the surviving company of the merger and the successor
entity to Woodbridge Holdings Corporation. Pursuant to the terms of the merger, which was approved
by the shareholders of Woodbridge and BFC at their respective meetings held on September&nbsp;21, 2009,
each outstanding share of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock automatically converted into the right
to receive 3.47 shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. Shares otherwise issuable to BFC
attributable to the shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock owned by
BFC were canceled in connection with the merger. The merger resulted in a net increase to BFC&#146;s
shareholders&#146; equity of approximately $95&nbsp;million, comprised of an increase in common stock and
additional paid-in capital of approximately $303,000 and $94.7&nbsp;million, respectively, and a
corresponding decrease to noncontrolling interest of approximately $99.6&nbsp;million.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the consummation of the merger, BFC owned approximately 22% of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock and all of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, representing approximately 59% of the
total voting power of Woodbridge. Since BFC had a controlling interest in Woodbridge, the financial
results of Woodbridge prior to the merger were consolidated in BFC&#146;s financial statements and
continue to be consolidated in BFC&#146;s financial statements. The merger was accounted for as an
equity transaction for financial reporting and accounting purposes in accordance with recently
adopted FASB authoritative guidance in connection with noncontrolling interests, which provides
that changes in a parent&#146;s ownership interest which do not result in the parent losing its
controlling interest are reported as equity transactions.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Florida law, holders of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock who did not vote to approve
our merger with Woodbridge and who properly asserted and exercised their appraisal rights with
respect to their shares (&#147;Dissenting Holders&#148;) are entitled to receive a cash payment in an amount
equal to the fair value of their shares (as determined in accordance with the provisions of Florida
law) in lieu of the shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock which they would otherwise have been
entitled to receive. Dissenting Holders, who owned in the aggregate approximately 4.6&nbsp;million
shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, provided written notice to Woodbridge regarding their
intent to exercise their appraisal rights. In accordance with Florida law, Woodbridge provided
written notices and required forms to the Dissenting Holders setting forth, among other things, its
determination that the fair value of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock immediately prior to the
effectiveness of the merger was $1.10 per share. Dissenting Holders were required to return their
appraisal forms by November&nbsp;10, 2009 and indicate on their appraisal forms whether the Dissenting
Holder chose to (i)&nbsp;accept Woodbridge&#146;s offer of $1.10 per share or (ii)&nbsp;demand payment of the fair
value estimate determined by the Dissenting Holder plus interest. One Dissenting Holder, which
held approximately 400,000 shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, has withdrawn its
shares from the appraisal rights process, while the remaining Dissenting Holders, who collectively
held approximately 4.2&nbsp;million</DIV>

and requested payment for their shares based on their respective fair value estimates of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. In December&nbsp;2009, the Company recorded a $4.6&nbsp;million liability
with a corresponding reduction to additional paid-in capital representing, in the aggregate,
Woodbridge&#146;s offer to the Dissenting Holders. The appraisal rights litigation thereafter commenced
and is currently ongoing. The outcome of the litigation is uncertain and there is no assurance as
to the amount of cash that will be required to be paid to the Dissenting Holders, which amount may
be greater than the $4.6&nbsp;million that we have accrued.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U><B><I>Bluegreen Share Acquisition </I></B></U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;16, 2009, the Company purchased approximately 7.4&nbsp;million shares of the common
stock of Bluegreen for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $23&nbsp;million, increasing its
interest from 29% to 52%, and resulting in the Company owning a controlling interest in Bluegreen.
The Company previously accounted for its 29% equity interest in Bluegreen as an equity method
investment. The fair value of the Company&#146;s investment in Bluegreen immediately before the
acquisition was $25.1&nbsp;million after recognizing a loss resulting from the remeasurement of its
investment in Bluegreen of $8.1&nbsp;million, which is included in the gain on bargain purchase of
Bluegreen in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. Bluegreen&#146;s results for the
Bluegreen Interim Period and the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 are consolidated into the Company&#146;s
financial statements. The Company consolidates all of Bluegreen&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiaries and
entities in which Bluegreen holds a controlling financial interest. The Company also consolidates
Bluegreen&#146;s non-wholly owned subsidiary, Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations, LLC (the &#147;Bluegreen/Big
Cedar Joint Venture&#148;), as Bluegreen holds a 51% equity interest in the Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint
Venture, has an active role as the day-to-day manager of the Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture&#146;s
activities, and has majority voting control of the Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture&#146;s management
committee.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in the Company&#146;s consolidated statement of operations is revenue related to Bluegreen
before purchase accounting adjustments of $33.5&nbsp;million for the Bluegreen Interim Period in 2009.
The operating results of Bluegreen for the Bluegreen Interim Period and the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2010 are included in the Company&#146;s Bluegreen Resorts and Bluegreen Communities segments. Prior to
the November&nbsp;16, 2009 acquisition date, the Company reported its interest in Bluegreen&#146;s earnings
and losses in the Woodbridge other operations segment.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounted for the acquisition of a controlling interest in Bluegreen in November
2009 in accordance with the accounting guidance of business combinations. As part of the accounting
for the November&nbsp;2009 Bluegreen share acquisition, management was required to evaluate the fair
value of Bluegreen&#146;s inventory and certain of Bluegreen&#146;s contracts. Based on preliminary estimates
made as part of the evaluation, the Company recorded a $183.1&nbsp;million &#147;bargain purchase gain&#148;
during the fourth quarter of 2009. However, as previously disclosed, the allocation of the
purchase price was based on preliminary estimates of the fair value of Bluegreen&#146;s inventory and
contracts, and is subject to change within the measurement period as valuations are finalized. If
the amounts are changed within the measurement period in a business combination, then the
adjustment to change these provisional amounts are retrospectively adjusted as of the date of
acquisition. Additionally, any offset relating to amortization/accretion is also retrospectively
adjusted in the appropriate periods. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company adjusted the
preliminary value assigned to the assets and liabilities of Bluegreen in order to reflect
additional information obtained since the acquisition date. These adjustments resulted in a
decrease in total assets and total liabilities of approximately $3.4&nbsp;million and $3.0&nbsp;million,
respectively, and a decrease in total equity of approximately $0.4&nbsp;million. Furthermore, the net
income attributable to BFC decreased by approximately $289,000 and earnings per share from
continuing operations decreased by approximately $0.01 per common share.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Company obtaining a controlling interest in Bluegreen, the Company&#146;s
previously held 29% equity interest in Bluegreen was re-measured to fair value. The fair value of
the non-controlling interest was based on a market approach valuation technique and inputs
categorized as Level 1 inputs under the accounting guidance for fair value measurements.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of the assets acquired includes: notes receivable which were fair valued using
an income approach and application of a discounted cash flow method; real estate inventory,
including resorts and communities inventory which was valued using a combination of the income
approach for the resorts inventory and independent appraisals for the communities real estate
projects; retained interest in notes receivable sold representing Bluegreen&#146;s economic interest in
the notes receivable it sold in a structured financing transaction, which was fair valued using an
income approach and a discount of the expected cash flows available to be distributed to investors;
and intangible assets, representing management contracts which consist of Bluegreen&#146;s contracts
with various homeowners associations to manage, service, staff and maintain properties. The
management contracts were fair valued using an income approach and excess earnings method whereby
the revenues and costs attributable to the management contracts less charges for use of the
contributory assets are used to determine excess earnings. The management contracts have
indefinite useful lives and are not amortized, but instead are reviewed for impairment on at least
an annual basis, or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying
amounts may not be recoverable.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liabilities subject to fair value determinations included: receivable-backed notes
payable, notes payable and lines of credit, which were valued based on the underlying terms,
including maturity dates of the loan facilities; junior subordinated debentures, which were valued
based on a discounted cash flow analysis; and non-controlling interest in a joint venture with Big
Cedar LLC, which was valued using a methodology consistent with the methodology used for the
valuation of Bluegreen&#146;s underlying assets and liabilities.</DIV>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;18, 2010, BankAtlantic Bancorp commenced a rights offering (the &#147;2010 Rights
Offering&#148;) to its shareholders of record as of the close of business on June&nbsp;14, 2010 (the &#147;Record
Date&#148;). In the 2010 Rights Offering, BankAtlantic Bancorp distributed to each eligible shareholder
0.327 subscription rights for each share of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock owned as of the close of business on the Record Date. Fractional subscription rights
were rounded up to the next largest whole number. Each subscription right entitled the holder
thereof to purchase one share of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock at the purchase price
of $1.50 per share. Shareholders who exercised their basic subscription rights in full were also
given the opportunity to request to purchase any additional shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class
A Common Stock that remained unsubscribed for at the expiration of the Rights Offering at the same
$1.50 per share purchase price. The 2010 Rights Offering expired on July&nbsp;20, 2010. BFC acquired an
aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock in the 2010 Rights
Offering for an aggregate purchase price of $15.0&nbsp;million. BFC exercised its basic subscription
rights to purchase 5,986,865 shares, and the remaining 4,013,135 shares were acquired by BFC
pursuant to its over-subscription request. The shares acquired in the 2010 Rights Offering
increased BFC&#146;s ownership interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp by approximately 8% to 45% and BFC&#146;s
voting interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp by approximately 5% to 71%.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third quarter of 2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp distributed to its shareholders 4.441
subscription rights for each share of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock held on August&nbsp;24, 2009 (the &#147;2009 Rights Offering&#148;). Each whole subscription right
entitled the holder to purchase one share of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock at a
purchase price of $2.00 per share. The 2009 Rights Offering commenced on August&nbsp;28, 2009 and was
completed on September&nbsp;29, 2009. BFC exercised its subscription rights in the 2009 Rights Offering
to purchase an aggregate of 14.9&nbsp;million shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock for
an aggregate purchase price of $29.9&nbsp;million. This purchase increased BFC&#146;s ownership interest in
BankAtlantic Bancorp by approximately 7% to 37% and increased BFC&#146;s voting interest in BankAtlantic
Bancorp by approximately 7% to 66%.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC&#146;s 2010 and 2009 acquisition of shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock were
accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with applicable Financial Accounting Standards
Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) authoritative guidance effective on January&nbsp;1, 2009, which provides that changes in
a parent&#146;s ownership interest which do not result in the parent losing its controlling interest are
reported as equity transactions.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From August&nbsp;18, 2008 through August&nbsp;28, 2008, BFC purchased an aggregate of 400,000 additional
shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock on the open market for an aggregate purchase
price of $2.8&nbsp;million. BFC&#146;s acquisition of the 400,000 <B>s</B>hares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock increased BFC&#146;s ownership interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp by approximately 4%. The
excess of the fair value over the purchase price (negative goodwill) of $16.7&nbsp;million was allocated
as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that would otherwise have been assigned ratably to all of
the non-current and non-financial assets acquired, except assets to be disposed of by sale and
deferred tax assets, until the basis of such acquired assets was zero. The remaining unallocated
negative goodwill of approximately $9.1&nbsp;million was recognized as an extraordinary gain for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From December&nbsp;2, 2008 through December&nbsp;11, 2008, BFC purchased an aggregate of 323,848
additional shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock on the open market for an
aggregate purchase price of $1.1&nbsp;million. BFC&#146;s acquisition of the 323,848 <B>s</B>hares of BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock increased BFC&#146;s ownership interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp by
approximately 3%. The excess of the fair value over the purchase price (negative goodwill) of $2.9
million was allocated ratably to all of the non-current and non-financial assets acquired, except
assets to be disposed of by sale and deferred tax assets.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition of additional shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock of BankAtlantic Bancorp in August
2008 and December&nbsp;2008 were accounted for as step acquisitions under the purchase method of
accounting in effect prior to January&nbsp;1, 2009.</DIV>

guidance associated with the consolidation of variable interest entities (&#147;VIEs&#148;). As a result of
the adoption of these accounting standards, Bluegreen consolidated seven existing special purpose
finance entities (&#147;QSPEs&#148;) associated with prior securitization transactions that previously
qualified for off-balance sheet sales treatment, which resulted in a one-time non-cash after-tax
reduction to retained earnings of $2.4&nbsp;million.  In addition, BankAtlantic Bancorp consolidated its joint venture that conducts a
factoring business. No charges were recorded to retained earnings in connection with the
consolidation of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s factoring joint venture.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidation of Bluegreen&#146;s special purpose finance entities also resulted in the
following impacts to BFC&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at January&nbsp;1, 2010: (1)
assets increased by $413.8&nbsp;million, primarily representing the consolidation of notes receivable,
net of allowance, partially offset by the elimination of retained interests; (2)&nbsp;liabilities
increased by $416.7&nbsp;million, primarily representing the consolidation of non-recourse debt
obligations to securitization investors, partially offset by the elimination of certain deferred
tax liabilities; and (3)&nbsp;total equity decreased by approximately
$2.9 million, including a decrease
to noncontrolling interest of approximately $1.4 million.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the adoption of the change in accounting principle on the related assets,
related liabilities, noncontrolling interests and total equity are as follows (in thousands):</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2009, Core Communities reinitiated efforts to sell the Projects, its two
commercial leasing projects, and began soliciting bids from several potential buyers for the
immediate sale of the Projects in their present condition. Due to this decision, the assets
associated with the Projects were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with the
accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets were reclassified as assets held for sale and the liabilities related to these
assets were reclassified as liabilities related to assets held for sale in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Condition at December&nbsp;31, 2009. Additionally, the results of operations for
the Projects were reclassified to income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Depreciation
related to these assets held for sale ceased in December&nbsp;2009. The Company elected not to separate
these assets in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010,
2009 and 2008. Management reviewed the net asset value and estimated the fair market value of the
assets based on the bids received related to these assets and determined that an impairment charge
was necessary to write down the aggregate carrying value of the Projects to fair value less the
estimated costs to sell and, accordingly, recorded an impairment charge of approximately $13.6
million in the fourth quarter of 2009.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;10, 2010, Core sold the Projects for approximately $75.4&nbsp;million. As a result of the
sale, a gain on sale of discontinued operations of approximately $2.6&nbsp;million was realized in the
second quarter of 2010. In connection with the sale, the outstanding balance of the loans related
to the assets held for sale was reduced by approximately $800,000 as a result of negotiations with
the lender. Core used the proceeds from the sale to repay these loans. As a result, Core was
released from its obligations to the lender with respect to the loans.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table summarizes the assets held for sale and liabilities related to the assets
held for sale for the Projects as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stifel sales agreement also required BankAtlantic Bancorp to indemnify Stifel for certain
losses arising out of activities of Ryan Beck prior to the sale and asserted through August&nbsp;31,
2009. Included in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations in discontinued operations for
each of the years in the two years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 is $0.5&nbsp;million of indemnification expenses
recognized by BankAtlantic Bancorp.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2011, BankAtlantic Bancorp and Stifel entered into a release and settlement
agreement with respect to outstanding indemnity claims asserted by Stifel. BankAtlantic Bancorp
agreed to pay Stifel $0.5&nbsp;million to satisfy all of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s obligations to Stifel
arising out of the indemnification agreement with the exception of one claim that was not covered
by the settlement agreement. BankAtlantic Bancorp reserved all rights and defenses concerning its
obligation to indemnify Stifel with respect to this claim.</DIV>

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August&nbsp;2010, BankAtlantic announced that, due to the rapidly changing environment in
Florida and the banking industry, it decided to focus on its core markets in South Florida and
BankAtlantic began seeking a buyer for its 19 Tampa, Florida branches. As a consequence,
BankAtlantic reclassified its fixed assets related to the Tampa branches to held-for-sale and
recognized a $4.5&nbsp;million impairment as these held-for-sale assets are accounted for at the lower
of cost or fair value. In January&nbsp;2011, BankAtlantic agreed to sell its 19 branches and 2 related
facilities in the Tampa area and the associated deposits to an unrelated financial institution. The
financial institution has agreed to pay i) a 10% premium for the deposits plus ii) the net book
value of the acquired real estate and fixed assets associated with the branches and facilities. The
transaction is anticipated to close during June&nbsp;2011 and is subject to regulatory approvals and
other customary terms and conditions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets and liabilities associated with the Tampa branches as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 were as

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management reviews its securities available for sale portfolio for other-than-temporary
declines in value quarterly. As a consequence of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s review during the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized a $1.6&nbsp;million and $3.4&nbsp;million,
respectively, other-than-temporary decline in value related to an equity investment in an unrelated
financial institution.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><B><I>BFC &#150; Benihana Investment</I></B></U></DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company owns 800,000 shares of Benihana Series&nbsp;B Convertible Preferred Stock (&#147;Convertible
Preferred Stock&#148;). The Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into an aggregate of 1,578,943
shares of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock at a conversion price of $12.67 per share of Convertible
Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment from time to time upon certain defined events. Based on the
number of currently outstanding shares of Benihana&#146;s capital stock, the Convertible Preferred
Stock, if converted, would represent an approximately 19% voting interest and an approximately 9%
economic interest in Benihana.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Convertible Preferred Stock was acquired pursuant to an agreement with Benihana on June&nbsp;8,
2004 to purchase an aggregate of 800,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock for $25.00 per
share. The shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock have voting rights on an &#147;as if converted&#148;
basis together with Benihana&#146;s Common Stock on all matters put to a vote of the holders of
Benihana&#146;s Common Stock. The approval of a majority of the holders of the Convertible Preferred
Stock then outstanding, voting as a single class, are required for certain events outside the
ordinary course of business. Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive
cumulative quarterly dividends at an annual rate equal to $1.25 per share, payable on the last day
of each calendar quarter. The Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to mandatory redemption at the
original issue price of $20&nbsp;million plus accumulated dividends on July&nbsp;2, 2014 unless BFC elects to
extend the mandatory redemption date to a later date not to extend beyond July&nbsp;2, 2024. At December
31, 2010, the closing price of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock was $8.01 per share. The market value of
the Convertible Preferred Stock if converted at December&nbsp;31, 2010 would have been approximately
$12.6&nbsp;million. During July&nbsp;2010, Benihana announced its intention to engage in a formal review of
strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of the company.
In the event that a sale transaction is consummated, the Company would receive a minimum of $20 million in consideration for its shares
of the Convertible Preferred Stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2008, the Company performed an impairment evaluation of its investment in the
Convertible Preferred Stock and determined that there was an other-than-temporary decline of
approximately $3.6&nbsp;million and, accordingly, the investment was written down to its fair value of
approximately $16.4&nbsp;million. Concurrent with management&#146;s evaluation of the impairment of this
investment at December&nbsp;31, 2008, it made the determination to reclassify this investment from
investment securities to investment securities available for sale. At December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009,
the Company&#146;s estimated fair value of its investment in Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock was
approximately $21.1&nbsp;million and $17.8&nbsp;million, respectively, which includes a gross unrealized gain
of approximately $3.3&nbsp;million and $1.3&nbsp;million, respectively, for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010
and 2009. BFC will continue to monitor this investment to determine whether any further
other-than-temporary impairment charges may be required in future periods. The estimated fair value
of the Company&#146;s investment in Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock was assessed using the income
approach with Level 3 inputs by discounting future cash flows at a market discount rate combined
with the fair value of the underlying shares of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock that BFC would receive upon
conversion of its shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock. See Note 30 for additional
information concerning the Benihana Convertible Preferred Stock.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During March&nbsp;2008, Woodbridge purchased 3,000,200 shares of Office Depot common stock at an
average price of $11.33 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $34.0&nbsp;million.
During June&nbsp;2008, 1,565,200 of the shares were sold at an average price of $12.08 per share for an
aggregate sales price of approximately $18.9&nbsp;million resulting in a gain of approximately $1.2
million.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In prior periods, impairment analyses were performed in connection with the Office Depot
investment, which included an evaluation of, among other things, qualitative and quantitative
factors relating to the performance of Office Depot and its stock price. As a result of these
evaluations, it was determined that other-than-temporary impairment charges were required at
December&nbsp;31, 2008 and March&nbsp;31, 2009 and accordingly, impairment charges of $12.0&nbsp;million and $2.4
million were recorded during the quarters ended December&nbsp;31 2008 and March&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively.</DIV>

who have or had land purchase option agreements with regional and/or national builders. The land
acquisition and development loan category consists of loans secured by residential land which was

development and construction loans are secured by residential land which was intended to be fully
developed by the borrower/developer who also might have plans to construct homes on the property.</DIV>

year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. Residential loans originated for sale as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and
2009 were loans originated through the assistance of an independent mortgage company. The mortgage
company provides processing and closing assistance to BankAtlantic. Pursuant to an agreement, this
mortgage company purchases the loans from BankAtlantic within a defined period of time after the
date of funding. BankAtlantic earns the interest income during the period of ownership. The sales
price is negotiated quarterly for all loans sold during the quarter based on originated loan
balance. Gains from the sale of loans held for sale were $0.4&nbsp;million, $0.5&nbsp;million and $0.3
million, respectively, for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Impaired Loans </I></B>&#151; Loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events,
the Company believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to
the contractual terms of the loan agreement. For a loan that has been restructured, the contractual
terms of the loan agreement refer to the contractual terms specified by the original loan
agreement, not the contractual terms specified by the restructured agreement. Impairment is
evaluated based on past due status for consumer and residential loans. Impairment is evaluated
based on BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s on-going credit monitoring process for commercial and small
business loans which results in the evaluation for impairment of all criticized loans. Factors
considered in determining if a loan is impaired are past payment history, strength of the borrower
or guarantors, and cash flow associated with the collateral or business. If a loan is impaired, a
specific valuation allowance is allocated, if necessary, based on the present value of estimated
future cash flows using the loan&#146;s existing interest rate or at the fair value of collateral if the
loan is collateral dependent. BankAtlantic generally measures commercial and small business loans
for impairment using the fair value of collateral less cost to sell method. Interest payments on
impaired loans for all loan classes are generally applied to principal unless collectibility of the
principal and interest amount is probable, in which case interest is recognized on an accrual
basis. Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible.</DIV>

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impaired loans without specific valuation allowances represent loans that were charged-down to
the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, loans in which the collateral value less cost
to sell was greater than the carrying value of the loan, loans in which the present value of
expected cash flows discounted at the loan&#146;s effective interest rate was equal to or greater than
the carrying value of the loan, or large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans that are
collectively measured for impairment.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp continuously monitors collateral dependent loans and performs an
impairment analysis on these loans quarterly. Generally, a full appraisal is obtained when a real
estate loan becomes adversely classified and an updated full appraisal is obtained within one year
from the prior appraisal date, or earlier if management deems it appropriate based on significant
changes in market conditions. In instances where a property is in the process of foreclosure, an
updated appraisal may be postponed beyond one year, as an appraisal is required on the date of
foreclosure; however, such loans are subject to quarterly impairment analyses. Included in total
impaired loans as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 was $320.8&nbsp;million of collateral dependent loans, of which
$158.1&nbsp;million were measured for impairment using current appraisals and $162.7&nbsp;million were
measured by adjusting appraisals to reflect changes in market conditions subsequent to the
appraisal date. Appraised values were adjusted down by an aggregate amount of $25.5&nbsp;million to
reflect current market conditions on 22 loans due to estimated property value declines since the
last appraisal dates.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, impaired loans with specific valuation allowances had been previously
charged down by $20.2&nbsp;million and impaired loans without specific valuation allowances had been
previously charged down by $130.6&nbsp;million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, impaired loans with specific

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management of BankAtlantic Bancorp monitors net charge-offs, levels of classified loans,
impaired loans and general economic conditions nationwide and in Florida to assess loan credit
quality. BankAtlantic Bancorp uses a risk grading matrix to monitor credit quality for commercial
and small business loans. Risk grades are assigned to each commercial and small business loan upon
origination. The loan officers monitor the risk grades and these risk grades are reviewed
periodically by a third party consultant. BankAtlantic Bancorp assigns risk grades on a scale of 1
to 13. A general description of the risk grades is as follows:</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades 1 to 7 &#151; The loans in these risk grades are generally well protected by the current
net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or guarantors or by the fair value, less cost to
sell, of the underlying collateral.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade 8 to 9 &#151; Not used.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade 10 &#151; These loans have potential weaknesses that deserve management&#146;s close attention.
While these loans do not expose BankAtlantic Bancorp to immediate risk of loss, if left
uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for
the loan.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade 11 &#151; These loans are inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying
capacity of the borrower or guarantors or by the collateral pledged, if any. Loans in this grade
have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the loan and there is a distinct
possibility that BankAtlantic Bancorp may sustain some credit loss if the weaknesses are not
corrected.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade 12 &#151; These loans have all the weaknesses of a Grade 11 with the added characteristic
that the weaknesses make collection of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s investment in the loan highly
questionable and improbable on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and fair values of
the collateral.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade 13 &#151; These loans or portions thereof, are considered uncollectible and of such little
value that continuance on BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s books as an asset is not warranted without the
establishment of a specific valuation allowance or a charge-off. Such loans are generally charged
down or completely charged off.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table presents risk grades for commercial and small business loans as of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performing impaired loans represent loans where BankAtlantic Bancorp anticipates collecting
all of the principal and interest on the loans but where the timing of the payments may not be in
accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans 90&nbsp;days past due and still
accruing are primarily loans that matured and are in the process of renewal, where the borrower
continues to make payments under the matured loan agreement or the loan has collateral sufficient
in management&#146;s judgment to prevent a loss to BankAtlantic Bancorp. Troubled debt restructured
loans are loans in which the original terms were modified granting the borrower loan concessions
due to financial difficulties. Generally, the concessions made to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulties include the reduction of the loan&#146;s contractual interest rate, conversion of
amortizing loans to interest only payments or the deferral of interest payments to the maturity
date of the loan. BankAtlantic Bancorp had commitments to lend $13.5&nbsp;million of additional funds on
non-performing and accruing impaired loans as of December&nbsp;31, 2010.</DIV>

if an entity in which it has a variable interest is a variable interest entity. Bluegreen&#146;s
analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews. Bluegreen bases its quantitative
analysis on the forecasted cash flows of the entity, and it bases its qualitative analysis on its
review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability,
and relevant financial agreements. Bluegreen also uses qualitative analyses to determine if it must
consolidate a variable interest entity as the primary beneficiary.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen sells through special purpose finance entities, VOI notes receivable originated by
Bluegreen Resorts. These transactions are generally structured as non-recourse to Bluegreen, with
the exception of one securitization transaction entered into in 2010, which was guaranteed by
Bluegreen (refer to the description of the Legacy Securitization in Note 23). These transactions
are generally designed to provide liquidity for Bluegreen and transfer the economic risks and
certain of the benefits of the notes receivable to third parties. In a securitization, various
classes of debt securities are issued by the special purpose finance entities that are generally
collateralized by a single tranche of transferred assets, which consist of VOI notes receivable.
Bluegreen services the notes receivable for a fee. With each securitization, Bluegreen generally
retains a portion of the securities.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in effect prior to 2010, seven of
Bluegreen&#146;s eight special purpose finance entities then in existence met the definition of a
qualified special purpose entity, and were not consolidated in its financial statements. Upon the
adoption of the new accounting guidance related to transfers of financial assets (see Note 5 for
additional information), Bluegreen was required to evaluate these entities for</DIV>

assets and related liabilities, and the entities have no equity investment at risk, they are
considered variable interest entities. Furthermore, since Bluegreen continues to service the notes
and retain rights to receive benefits that are potentially significant to the entities, Bluegreen
concluded that it is the entities&#146; primary beneficiary and, therefore, now consolidates these
entities into its financial statements. Please see Note 5 for the impact of initial consolidation
of these entities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the principal balance of VOI notes receivable included within the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition that are restricted to satisfy obligations
of the variable interest entities&#146; obligations totaled $533.3&nbsp;million. In addition, approximately
$41.2&nbsp;million of Bluegreen&#146;s restricted cash is held in accounts for the benefit of the variable
interest entities. Further, at December&nbsp;31, 2010, the carrying amount of the consolidated
liabilities included within the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition for these
variable interest entities totaled $459.0&nbsp;million, comprised of $436.2&nbsp;million of non-recourse
receivable-backed notes payable and $22.8&nbsp;million of receivable-backed notes payable which is
recourse to Bluegreen. See Note 23, Debt<I>.</I></DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of certain of Bluegreen&#146;s timeshare note sales, Bluegreen has the right at its
option to repurchase or substitute for defaulted mortgage notes at the outstanding principal
balance plus accrued interest or, in some facilities, at 24% of the original sale price associated
with the defaulted mortgage note. The transaction documents typically limit such repurchases or
substitutions to 15-20% of the receivables originally funded into the transaction. Voluntary
repurchases or substitutions by Bluegreen of defaulted notes during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2010 were $37.6&nbsp;million.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;1, 2010, we adopted an amendment to the accounting guidance for transfers of
financial assets and an amendment to the accounting guidance associated with the consolidation of
VIEs. As a result of the adoption of these accounting standards, Bluegreen consolidated seven
existing special purpose finance entities (&#147;QSPEs&#148;) associated with prior securitization
transactions which previously qualified for off-balance sheet sales treatment. Accordingly,
Bluegreen&#146;s special purpose finance entities are now consolidated in BFC&#146;s financial statements.
The consolidation of Bluegreen&#146;s special purpose finance entities resulted in the elimination of
the retained interests in notes receivable, for further information see Note 5.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the cash paid for the purchase of defaulted receivables, Bluegreen also
acquires delinquent or defaulted receivables from its qualifying special purpose finance
subsidiaries in exchange for unencumbered receivables (a process known as substitution). During
the Bluegreen Interim Period, Bluegreen acquired notes receivable totaling $4.6&nbsp;million through
substitutions. Although Bluegreen is not obligated to repurchase or substitute for delinquent or
defaulted notes receivable from its qualifying special purpose finance subsidiaries, it may do so
from time to time. The VOIs securing the delinquent and defaulted receivables that Bluegreen
received in this manner are typically recovered and put back in VOI inventory and resold in the
normal course of business.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventory consisted of the combined real estate assets of Bluegreen Resorts, Bluegreen
Communities, Carolina Oak, Core Communities, BankAtlantic&#146;s residential construction development
acquired in 2002, and BankAtlantic land and facilities held for sale for BankAtlantic&#146;s store
expansion program. During the fourth quarter of 2010, Core relinquished to its lenders title to
substantially all of the land Core owned in both Florida and South Carolina and pledged its
ownership interests in several Core subsidiaries.
During February 2011, Core was released from any other claims arising from or relating to the loans.
 With the exception of certain assets within Tradition Hilton Head
with a carrying value of $19.4&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010, which are the subject of separate
foreclosure proceedings that are not expected to begin until later in the first half of 2011, land
and land development costs reflect an adjustment for the carrying value of $121.9&nbsp;million in
satisfaction of Core&#146;s outstanding debt of $112.3&nbsp;million related to those assets. See Note 23
under the caption <I>Notes and Mortgage Notes Payable and Other Borrowings </I>for further information
regarding Core&#146;s settlement of its debt obligations.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real estate inventory is reviewed for impairment on a project-by-project basis. Long-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used
is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future undiscounted
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or by using appraisals of the related assets. If
the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment
charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair
value. As a result of the impairment analyses performed, the Company recorded real estate inventory
impairment charges of approximately</DIV>

$3.5&nbsp;million related to Carolina Oak for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,

from a residential construction development acquired by BankAtlantic in 2002. During the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic sold the real estate project for approximately $5.2&nbsp;million
and recognized a $1.2&nbsp;million loss which is included in Financial Services &#151; other expenses.
During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, BankAtlantic recognized $3.9&nbsp;million and $1.2

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen reviews its undeveloped resort and residential communities&#146; properties for
impairment under the accounting guidelines, which requires that such property be reviewed for
impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
might not be recoverable. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen evaluated the carrying value of it
Bluegreen Communities undeveloped inventory based upon the probability weighted average cashflows
at various outcomes including the development and sale of such inventory as retail homesites. In
connection with this analysis, Bluegreen recorded an impairment charge (included in cost of real
estate sales) of $14.9&nbsp;million to write down the carrying amount of certain undeveloped phases in
several of its residential communities properties in its Bluegreen Communities segment to fair
value, as it determined that the carrying amounts of these homesites would not be recovered by
estimated future cash flows. Bluegreen estimated the fair value of the underlying properties based
on either the prices of comparable properties or its analysis of their estimated future cash flows
(Level 3 inputs), discounted at rates commensurate with the risk inherent in the property.
Bluegreen estimated future cash flows based upon its expectations of performance given current and
projected forecasts of the economy and real estate markets in general. Should adverse conditions in
the real estate market continue longer than forecasted or deteriorate further or if its performance
does not meet the expectations on which its estimates were based, additional charges will be
recorded in the future. Furthermore, should its intentions or estimates relative to its Bluegreen
Communities business change in the future, the carrying values of the related inventory and its
results of operations could be materially adversely affected.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, BankAtlantic invested in a joint venture involved in
the factoring of accounts receivable. While BankAtlantic owns 50% of the entity, the maximum
exposure to BankAtlantic from this investment is $10&nbsp;million and under prior accounting guidance
BankAtlantic was not considered the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the factoring joint venture
was presented under the equity method of accounting as a variable interest entity for the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. The factoring
joint venture was consolidated in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 upon the implementation of new accounting guidance effective January&nbsp;1,
2010. Based on the new accounting guidance, BankAtlantic is considered the primary beneficiary as
it is deemed to have the power to direct the activities of the factoring joint venture and has the
obligation to absorb the majority of the entity&#146;s losses.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><I>Investment in Bluegreen Corporation </I></U></DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously discussed, approximately 7.4&nbsp;million additional shares of Bluegreen&#146;s common
stock were purchased on November&nbsp;16, 2009, increasing our ownership in Bluegreen to 16.9&nbsp;million
shares, or 52%, of Bluegreen&#146;s outstanding common stock. As a result of the purchase, the Company
has a controlling interest in Bluegreen and, accordingly, has consolidated Bluegreen&#146;s results
since November&nbsp;16, 2009 into the Company&#146;s financial statements.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to November&nbsp;16, 2009, the investment in Bluegreen was accounted for using the equity
method of accounting. The cost of the Bluegreen investment was adjusted to recognize the Company&#146;s
interest in Bluegreen&#146;s earnings or losses. The difference between a) the Company&#146;s ownership
percentage in Bluegreen multiplied by its earnings and b) the amount of the Company&#146;s equity in
earnings of Bluegreen as reflected in the Company&#146;s financial statements related to the
amortization or accretion of purchase accounting made at the time of the initial acquisition of
Bluegreen&#146;s common stock and a basis difference due to impairment charges recorded on the
investment in Bluegreen, as described below. Based on the results of the evaluations of the
investment in Bluegreen, other-than-temporary impairment charges of approximately $31.2&nbsp;million and
$94.4&nbsp;million were recorded during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.</DIV>

    <TD>As a result of the impairment charges previously taken under the equity method prior to our
consolidation of Bluegreen in November&nbsp;2009, a basis difference was created between the
investment in Bluegreen and the underlying assets and liabilities carried on the books of
Bluegreen. Therefore, earnings from Bluegreen were adjusted each period to reflect the
amortization of this basis difference. As such, a methodology was established to allocate the
impairment loss to the relative estimates of the fair value of Bluegreen&#146;s underlying assets
based upon the position that the impairment loss was a reflection of the perceived value of
these underlying assets. The appropriate amortization was calculated based on the estimated
useful lives of the underlying assets and other relevant data associated with each asset
category.</TD>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2008, Woodbridge determined that the fair value of its investment
in its unconsolidated trusts, which consists of its common interests in subordinated trust debt
securities of approximately $406,000, was less than the carrying value of this investment of $2.6
million primarily due to the deterioration of the market for these instruments and overall economic
conditions. Accordingly, it was determined that an impairment charge of approximately $2.2&nbsp;million
was required at December&nbsp;31, 2008. See Note 23 under the caption <I>Junior Subordinated Debentures </I>for
additional information about the statutory business trusts which were formed for the purpose of
issuing trust preferred securities and investing the proceeds thereof in junior subordinated

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill is tested for potential impairment annually or during interim periods if impairment
indicators exist. Goodwill of $12.2&nbsp;million (net of purchase accounting of $0.9&nbsp;million) included
in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 is
associated with BankAtlantic&#146;s capital services reporting unit. Goodwill was tested for impairment
on September&nbsp;30, 2010 (the annual testing date) and was determined not to be impaired. As of
September&nbsp;30, 2010, the estimated fair value of BankAtlantic capital services reporting unit
exceeded the estimated fair value of the underlying assets by $14.1&nbsp;million. If market conditions
do not improve or deteriorate further, the Company may recognize goodwill impairment charges in
future periods.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value
of the reporting units. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and
estimates relating to future cash flows, including the view of current economic indicators and
market valuations, and assumptions about BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s strategic plans with regard to its
operations. Due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates, actual results could differ
materially from the estimates.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing its impairment analysis, BankAtlantic Bancorp used a combination of the
discounted cash flow methodology and a market multiple methodology to determine the fair value of
each reporting unit. The aggregate fair value of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s reporting units was
compared to its market capitalization adjusted for a control premium in order to determine the
reasonableness of the financial model output. A control premium represents the value an investor
would pay above minority interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in
the respective company.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of
the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit. The discount rate applied
to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks
of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows. A
five year period is generally used in computing discounted cash flow values. The most significant
assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate, the terminal value
and the forecast of future cash flows.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market multiple methodology establishes fair value by comparing BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
reporting units to other similar publicly traded companies. The market multiples that BankAtlantic
Bancorp used in the determination of the fair value of the reporting units were its market
capitalization to its tangible stockholders&#146; equity.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to deteriorating economic and real estate market conditions and the effects that
the external environment had on BankAtlantic&#146;s business units, BankAtlantic, in the first quarter
of 2009, continued to reduce its asset balances and borrowings with a view toward improving its
regulatory capital ratios and revised its projected operating results to reflect a smaller
organization in subsequent periods. Additionally, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s market capitalization
continued to decline as the average closing price of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock on
the New York Stock Exchange for the month of March&nbsp;2009 was $1.57 compared to $4.23 for the month
of December&nbsp;2008, a decline of 63%. Management of BankAtlantic Bancorp believed that the foregoing
factors indicated that the fair value of its reporting units might have declined below their
carrying amount, and, accordingly, an interim goodwill impairment test was performed as of March
31, 2009. Based on the results of this interim goodwill impairment evaluation, an impairment charge
of $8.5&nbsp;million, net of a purchase accounting adjustment from step acquisition of approximately
$0.6&nbsp;million, was recorded during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009, relating to BankAtlantic&#146;s
tax certificate ($4.7&nbsp;million) and investments ($4.5&nbsp;million) reporting units. Additionally, during
2009, we also determined that all $2.0&nbsp;million of the previously recorded goodwill related to
our investment in Pizza Fusion
was impaired. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $2.0&nbsp;million which is
included in the Company&#146;s Real Estate and Other activities as impairment of goodwill in the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009.

goodwill, relating to BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s commercial lending and community banking reporting
units of $31.0&nbsp;million and $17.3&nbsp;million, respectively, was
determined to be impaired. The goodwill impairment recognized during 2008 generally reflected
the adverse conditions in the financial services industry, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s market
capitalization declining significantly below its tangible book value and the effect that the
continued deterioration in the general economy as well as the Florida real estate markets had on
the credit quality of BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolio.</DIV>

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent transactions where BankAtlantic sells
a portion of its current investment portfolio (usually mortgage-backed securities and real estate
mortgage investment conduits) at a negotiated rate and agrees to repurchase the same assets at a
specified future date. BankAtlantic issues repurchase
agreements to institutions and to its customers. These transactions are collateralized by
securities available for sale. Customer repurchase agreements are not insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#147;FDIC&#148;). At December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, the outstanding balances of
customer repurchase agreements were $21.5&nbsp;million and $24.5&nbsp;million, respectively. There were no
institutional repurchase agreements outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009. BankAtlantic had
$195&nbsp;million of securities that could be sold or pledged for additional repurchase agreement
borrowings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Liberty Bank Facility</I>. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen had a $75.0&nbsp;million revolving
timeshare receivables hypothecation facility with a syndicate of lenders led by Liberty Bank and
assembled by Wellington Financial (&#147;Liberty Bank Facility&#148;). During 2010, Bluegreen pledged $27.6
million of VOI notes receivable to this facility and received cash proceeds of $27.4&nbsp;million.
Bluegreen also repaid $18.9&nbsp;million on the facility.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2011, Bluegreen revised the terms of and extended the Liberty Bank Facility. The
revised $60.0&nbsp;million facility (&#147;New Liberty Bank Facility&#148;) provides for an 85% advance on
eligible receivables pledged under the facility during a two-year period ending in February&nbsp;2013,
subject to customary terms and conditions. Availability under the New Liberty Bank Facility is
reduced by amounts currently outstanding to certain syndicate participants under the existing
Liberty Bank Facility. At February&nbsp;28, 2011, such outstanding amounts under the existing Liberty
Bank Facility were approximately $47.0&nbsp;million, therefore, initial availability under the New
Liberty Bank Facility was approximately $13.0&nbsp;million, but as outstanding amounts on the existing
facility amortize over time, the New Liberty Bank Facility will revolve up to $60.0&nbsp;million,
subject to eligible collateral and customary terms and conditions. Principal and interest will be
paid as cash is collected on the pledged receivables, with the remaining balance due in February
2016.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indebtedness under the New Liberty Bank Facility bears interest at the Prime Rate (as
published in the Wall Street Journal) plus 2.25%, subject to a floor of 6.5%.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the significant non-cash charges associated with loan loss reserves and
Communities&#146; inventory impairments as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen would have been in violation
of one of the original net worth covenants under the Liberty Bank Facility as of that date.
However, in March&nbsp;2011, Liberty Bank confirmed that the covenants contained in the New Liberty Bank
Facility superseded the covenants contained in the original facility. Bluegreen was in compliance
with all applicable covenants as of December&nbsp;31, 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The GE Bluegreen/Big Cedar Receivables Facility. </I>In April&nbsp;2007, the Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint
Venture entered into a $45&nbsp;million revolving VOI receivables credit facility with GE (the &#147;GE
Bluegreen/Big Cedar Facility&#148;). Bluegreen Corporation has guaranteed the full payment and
performance of the Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture in connection with the GE Bluegreen/Big Cedar
Receivable Facility. The advance period under this facility expired on April&nbsp;16, 2009, and all
outstanding borrowings are scheduled to mature no later than April&nbsp;16, 2016. The facility has
detailed requirements with respect to the eligibility of receivables for inclusion and other
conditions funding. The facility includes affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events
of default. All principal and interest payments received on pledged receivables are applied to
principal and interest due under the facility. Indebtedness under the facility bears interest
adjusted monthly at a rate equal to the 30&nbsp;day LIBOR rate plus 1.75%. During 2010, Bluegreen repaid
$8.9&nbsp;million on this facility.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Lecacy Securitization. </I>In September&nbsp;2010, Bluegreen completed a securitization transaction of
the lowest FICO<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">R-</SUP>score loans previously financed in the BB&#038;T Purchase Facility.
Substantially all of the timeshare receivables included in this transaction were generated prior to
December&nbsp;15, 2008, the date that Bluegreen implemented its FICO<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">R</SUP> score-based credit
underwriting program, and had FICO<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">R </SUP>scores below 600.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this private placement transaction, BXG Legacy 2010 LLC, a wholly-owned special purpose
subsidiary of Bluegreen, issued $27&nbsp;million of notes payable secured by a portfolio of timeshare
receivables totaling $36.1&nbsp;million (the&#148; Legacy Securitization&#148;). While the notes payable have a
coupon rate of 12%, they were sold at a $2.7&nbsp;million discount to yield an effective rate of 18.5%.
The notes payable generated gross proceeds to Bluegreen of $24.3&nbsp;million (before fees and customary
reserves and expenses), which was used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under the BB&#038;T
Purchase Facility. During 2010, Bluegreen repaid $1.7&nbsp;million on this facility.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen guaranteed the principal payments for defaulted vacation ownership loans in the
Legacy Securitization at amounts equivalent to the then-current advance rate inherent in the notes,
any shortfalls in monthly interest distributions to the Legacy Securitization investors and any
shortfall in the ultimate principal payment on the notes upon their stated maturity in September
2025.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>NBA Receivables Facility. </I>In September&nbsp;2010, Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture entered into a
$20.0&nbsp;million timeshare receivables hypothecation facility with National Bank of Arizona (&#147;NBA&#148;).
Bluegreen Corporation has guaranteed the full payment and performance of Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint
Venture in connection with this facility. The facility provides for an 85% advance on $23.5&nbsp;million
of eligible receivables, all of which were pledged under the facility at closing, subject to terms
and conditions which Bluegreen believes to be customary for facilities of this type.
All principal and interest payments received on pledged receivables are applied to principal
and interest due under the facility, with the remaining balance due in September&nbsp;2017. Indebtedness
under this facility bears interest at the 30-day LIBOR plus 5.25%, subject to a floor of 6.75%.
During 2010, Bluegreen repaid $1.6&nbsp;million on this facility.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen has received a term sheet from NBA to amend its existing facility to allow Bluegreen
to pledge additional timeshare receivables up to the borrowing limit, with the additional advances
not to exceed $5.0&nbsp;million. There can be no assurances that Bluegreen will close on this amendment
on favorable terms, if at all.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Wells Fargo Facility. </I>Bluegreen has a credit facility with Wells Fargo Capital Finance,
LLC (&#147;Wells Fargo&#148;). Historically, Bluegreen primarily used this facility for borrowings
collateralized by the pledge of certain VOI receivables which typically have been its one-year term
receivables. The borrowing period for advances on eligible receivables expired on December&nbsp;31,
2009, and the facility was fully paid down in 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>BB&#038;T Purchase Facility. </I>Bluegreen has a $75.0&nbsp;million timeshare notes receivable purchase
facility with Branch Banking and Trust Company (&#147;BB&#038;T&#148;) (the &#147;BB&#038;T Purchase Facility&#148;). The BB&#038;T
Purchase Facility provides for a  revolving advance period through December&nbsp;17, 2011. The interest rates
on future advances under the facility are the Prime Rate plus 2.0%, subject to tiered increases
once the outstanding balance equals or exceeds $25.0&nbsp;million, subject to a maximum interest rate of
the Prime Rate plus 3.5%, once the facility equals or exceeds $50.0&nbsp;million. Additionally,
Bluegreen receives all of the excess cash flows generated by the timeshare receivables transferred
to BB&#038;T under the facility (excess meaning after customary payment of fees, interest and principal
under the facility). The BB&#038;T Purchase Facility provides for the financing of Bluegreen&#146;s timeshare
receivables at an advance rate of 67.5%, subject to the terms of the facility.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While ownership of the receivables is transferred for legal purposes, the transfers of
receivables under the facility are accounted for as secured borrowings. Accordingly, the
receivables are reflected as assets and the associated obligations are reflected as liabilities on
our balance sheet. The BB&#038;T Purchase Facility is nonrecourse and is not guaranteed by Bluegreen.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, the entire $75.0&nbsp;million BB&#038;T facility was available, subject to
eligible collateral and customary terms and conditions.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>2010 Term Securitization</I>. On December&nbsp;17, 2010, Bluegreen completed a private offering and
sale of $107.6&nbsp;million of investment-grade, timeshare loan-backed notes (the &#147;2010 Term
Securitization&#148;). The 2010-A Term Securitization consisted of the issuance of $88.0&nbsp;million of A
rated and $19.6&nbsp;million of BBB rated timeshare-loan backed notes with coupon rates of 5.1% and
7.5%, respectively, which blended to a weighted average coupon rate of 5.5%. The advance rate for
this transaction was 85.25%. BB&#038;T Capital Markets acted as the sole placement agent and initial
purchaser.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of the timeshare receivables sold was $126.2&nbsp;million, substantially all of which
was provided at closing. Through the completion of this private offering Bluegreen repaid BB&#038;T
approximately $93.6&nbsp;million, representing all amounts outstanding under the Company&#146;s existing
receivables purchase facility with BB&#038;T, including accrued interest.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While ownership of the timeshare receivables included in the 2010 Term Securitization is
transferred and sold for legal purposes, the transfer of these timeshare receivables is accounted
for as a secured borrowing.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2010 Term Securitization is non-recourse and is not guaranteed by Bluegreen.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Big Cedar Quorum Federal Credit Union. </I>On December&nbsp;22, 2010, Bluegreen entered into a new
timeshare receivables purchase facility (the &#147;Quorum Facility&#148;) with Quorum Federal Credit Union
(&#147;Quorum&#148;). The Quorum Facility allows for the sale of timeshare notes receivable on a non-recourse
basis, pursuant to the terms of the facility and subject to certain conditions precedent. Quorum
has agreed to purchase eligible timeshare receivables from us or certain of our subsidiaries up to
an aggregate $20.0&nbsp;million purchase price through December&nbsp;22, 2011. The terms of the Quorum
Facility reflect an 80% advance rate and a program fee rate of 8% per annum through August&nbsp;31, 2011
and terms to be agreed upon through December&nbsp;22, 2011. Eligibility requirements for receivables
sold include, amongst others, that the obligors under the timeshare notes receivable sold be
members of Quorum at the time of the note sale. The Quorum Facility contemplates the ability of
Quorum to purchase additional receivables subject to advance rates, fees and other terms to be
agreed upon from time to time over and above the initial $20.0&nbsp;million commitment, pursuant to the
terms of the facility and subject to certain conditions precedent. Subject to performance of the
collateral,
Bluegreen will receive all of the excess cash flows generated by the receivables transferred
to Quorum under the facility (excess meaning after customary payment of fees and return of amounts
invested by Quorum under the facility on a pro-rata basis as borrowers make payments on their
timeshare loans).</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While ownership of any timeshare receivables financed through the Quorum facility are
considered transferred and sold to Quorum for legal purposes, the transfer of these timeshare
receivables is accounted for as a secured borrowing.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in further detail in Note 5 above, on January&nbsp;1, 2010, Bluegreen consolidated
special purpose finance entities previously reported &#147;off-balance-sheet&#148; and associated
receivable-backed notes payable. These entities and their associated debt were not required to be
consolidated during periods prior to January&nbsp;1, 2010. Historically, Bluegreen has been a party to
a number of securitization-type transactions, in which it sold receivables to one of its special
purpose finance entities which, in turn, sold the receivables either directly to third parties or
to a trust established for the transaction. These receivables were typically sold on a
non-recourse basis (except for breaches of certain representations and warranties). Under these
arrangements, the cash payments received from obligors on the receivables sold are generally
applied monthly to pay fees to service providers, make interest and principal payments to
investors, and fund required reserves, if any, with the remaining balance of such cash retained by
us; however, to the extent the portfolio of receivables fails to satisfy specified performance
criteria (as may occur due to an increase in default rates or loan loss severity) or other trigger
events, the funds received from obligors are distributed on an accelerated basis to investors.
Depending on the circumstances and the transaction, the application of the accelerated payment
formula may </DIV>

subsidiaries in Port St. Lucie, Florida, substantially all of which is undeveloped raw land. Core
also agreed to an amendment of the complaint related to the Florida foreclosure action to include
this additional collateral and an entry into consensual judgments of foreclosure in both the
Florida and South Carolina foreclosure actions. In consideration therefor, the lender agreed not
to enforce a deficiency judgment against Core and during February 2011, released Core from any other claims arising from
or relating to the loans. As of November&nbsp;30, 2010, Core deconsolidated the five subsidiaries, the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Woodbridge recorded a guarantee obligation &#147;deferred gain on settlement of investment in
subsidiary&#148; of $11.3&nbsp;million in the Company&#146;s consolidated statement of financial position as of
December&nbsp;31, 2010. The deferred gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary was recognized into income
in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations at the time Core received its general release
of liability in February&nbsp;2011.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2010, Core and one of its subsidiaries entered agreements, including without
limitation, a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure Agreement, with one of their lenders which resolved the
foreclosure proceedings commenced by the lender related to property at Tradition Hilton Head which
served as collateral for a $25&nbsp;million loan. Pursuant to the agreements, Core&#146;s subsidiary
transferred to the lender all of its right, title and interest in and to the property which served
as collateral for the loan as well as certain additional real and personal property. In
consideration therefore, the lender released Core and its subsidiary from any claims arising from
or relating to the loan. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, this transaction was
accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring and  a $13.0&nbsp;million gain on debt
extinguishment was recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development activities at Carolina Oak, which is within Tradition Hilton Head, were
suspended in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of, among other things, an overall softening of
demand for new homes and a decline in the overall economy. In 2009, the housing industry continued
to face significant challenges and Woodbridge made the decision to cease all activities at Carolina
Oak. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we reviewed the inventory of real estate at Carolina Oak for
impairment and as a result, recorded a $16.7&nbsp;million impairment charge to adjust the carrying
amount of Carolina Oak&#146;s inventory to its fair value of $10.8&nbsp;million. Woodbridge is the obligor
under a $37.2&nbsp;million loan that is collateralized by the Carolina Oak property. During 2009, the
lender declared the loan to be in default and filed an action for foreclosure. While there may have
been an issue with respect to compliance with certain covenants in the loan documents, we do not
believe that an event of default occurred. Through participation in a court-ordered mediation of
this matter, the parties agreed to tentative terms to settle the matter and are currently
negotiating a formal settlement agreement. It is currently expected that this settlement
agreement, if finalized, will provide for (i)&nbsp;Woodbridge to pay $2.5&nbsp;million to the investor group,
(ii)&nbsp;Carolina Oak to convey to the investor group the real property securing the loan via a
stipulated foreclosure or deed in lieu, (iii)&nbsp;the investor group to release Woodbridge and Carolina
Oak from their obligations relating to the debt or, alternatively, to agree not to pursue certain
remedies, including a deficiency judgment, that would otherwise be available to them, in each case
subject to certain conditions, and (iv)&nbsp;the litigation to be dismissed. There is no assurance that
the settlement will be finalized on the contemplated terms, or at all.</DIV>

the material financial terms of

certain of Bluegreen&#146;s resorts and currently has two outstanding project loans. The maturity date
for the project loan collateralized by our Bluegreen Club 36<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">TM</SUP> resort in Las Vegas,
Nevada (the &#147;Club 36 Loan&#148;) is June&nbsp;30, 2012. Approximately $49.9&nbsp;million was outstanding on the
Club 36 Loan as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, $27.3&nbsp;million of which is due by October&nbsp;31, 2011. The
maturity date for the project loan collateralized by our Fountains resort in Orlando, Florida (the
&#147;Fountains Loans&#148;) is March&nbsp;31, 2011. Approximately $2.4&nbsp;million was outstanding on this loan as of
December&nbsp;31, 2010. Principal payments are effected through agreed-upon release prices as timeshare
interests in the resorts collateralizing the RFA AD&#038;C Facility are sold, subject to periodic
minimum required amortization on the Club 36 Loan and the Fountains Loans. As of December&nbsp;31,
2010, Bluegreen had no availability under this facility. During 2010, Bluegreen repaid $35.2

Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (&#147;Wells Fargo&#148;), which amended, restated and consolidated Bluegreen&#146;s then
existing notes payable and line-of-credit with Wachovia Bank, N.A. into a single term loan with
Wells Fargo (the &#147;Wells Fargo Term Loan&#148;). The notes payable and line-of-credit which were
consolidated into the Wells Fargo Term Loan had a total outstanding balance of $36.4&nbsp;million as of
April&nbsp;30, 2010. In connection with the closing of the Wells Fargo Term Loan, Bluegreen made a
principal payment of $0.4&nbsp;million, reducing the balance to $36.0&nbsp;million, and paid accrued interest
on the then-existing Wachovia debt. Principal payments are effected through agreed-upon release
prices as real estate collateralizing the Wells Fargo Term Loan is sold, subject to minimum
remaining required amortization as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, of $10.6&nbsp;million in 2011 and $20.2&nbsp;million
in 2012. In addition to the resort projects previously pledged as collateral for the various notes
payable to Wachovia, Bluegreen pledged additional timeshare interests, resorts real estate, and the
residual interests in certain of our sold VOI notes receivable as collateral for the Wells Fargo
Term Loan. As required by the terms of the Wells Fargo Term Loan, Wells Fargo received, as
additional collateral, the residual interest in 2010 Term Securitization. The Wells Fargo Term Loan
bears interest at the 30-day LIBOR plus 6.87% (7.13% as of December&nbsp;31, 2010).</DIV>

(the &#147;Textron AD&#038;C Facility&#148;) with Textron Financial Corporation (&#147;Textron&#148;). The Textron AD&#038;C

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;28, 2009, Bluegreen entered into an amendment to the Textron AD&#038;C Facility and a
sub-loan under the Facility used to fund the acquisition and development of our Odyssey Dells
Resort (the &#147;Odyssey Sub-Loan&#148;).
The amendment to the Odyssey Sub-Loan extended the final maturity of outstanding borrowings under
the Odyssey Sub-Loan to December&nbsp;31, 2011, and revised the periodic minimum required principal
amortization. As amended, our next minimum required principal payment will be approximately $0.4
million in March&nbsp;2010 with additional minimum required principal payments of $1.0&nbsp;million per
quarter thereafter through maturity. Bluegreen pays Textron principal payments as it sells
timeshare interests that collateralize the Odyssey Sub-Loan, subject to periodic minimum required
principal amortization. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, our outstanding borrowings under the Sub-Loan
totaled approximately $3.6&nbsp;million.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sub-loan used to acquire Bluegreen&#146;s Atlantic Palace Resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey
was $5.7&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 (the &#147;Atlantic Palace Sub-Loan&#148;). Bluegreen pays Textron
principal payments as it sells timeshare interests that collateralize the Atlantic Palace Sub-Loan,
subject to periodic minimum required principal amortization. The final maturity of outstanding
borrowings under the Atlantic Palace Sub-Loan is April&nbsp;2013.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen has guaranteed all sub-loans under the Textron AD&#038;C Facility. Interest on the
Textron AD&#038;C Facility is equal to the prime rate plus 1.25% &#151; 1.50% and is due monthly. During
2010, Bluegreen repaid $3.5&nbsp;million under this facility.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Fifth Third Bank Note Payable</I>. In April&nbsp;2008, Bluegreen purchased a building in Myrtle Beach,
South Carolina. The purchase price was $4.8&nbsp;million, of which $3.4&nbsp;million was financed by a note
payable to Fifth Third Bank. Interest is payable monthly through the earlier of the construction
completion date or October&nbsp;31, 2009, and bears interest at a rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus
3.00%. Interest and principal payments are currently made monthly until maturity. The note
payable matures in April&nbsp;2023. During 2010, we repaid $0.2&nbsp;million under this facility.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2002, BankAtlantic issued $22&nbsp;million of floating rate subordinated debentures due
in 2012. The subordinated debentures pay interest quarterly and are currently redeemable at a
price based upon then-prevailing market interest rates. The subordinated debentures were issued by
BankAtlantic in a private transaction as part of a larger pooled securities offering. The
subordinated debentures qualify for inclusion in BankAtlantic&#146;s total risk based capital.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 the mortgage-backed bonds were retired. During the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the holder of a mortgage-backed bond issued by a financial
institution acquired by BankAtlantic agreed to accept a $2.8&nbsp;million payment for the retirement of
$3.1&nbsp;million in mortgage-backed bonds. Included in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of
Operations in Financial Services &#151; cost associated with debt redemption for the year ended December
31, 2008 is a $0.3&nbsp;million gain from the early extinguishment of the mortgage-backed bonds.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen formed statutory business trusts, each of which issued trust preferred securities
and invested the proceeds thereof in its junior subordinated debentures. The trusts are variable
interest entities in which Bluegreen is not the primary beneficiary as defined by the accounting
guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities. Accordingly, Bluegreen does not
consolidate the operations of the Trusts; instead, the trusts are accounted for under the equity
method of accounting. In each of these transactions, the applicable Trust issued trust preferred
securities as part of a larger pooled trust securities offering which was not registered under the
Securities Act of 1933. The applicable Bluegreen trust then used the proceeds from issuing the
trust preferred securities to purchase an identical amount of junior subordinated debentures from
Bluegreen. Interest on the junior subordinated debentures and distributions on the trust preferred
securities are payable quarterly in arrears at the fixed rates as described in the above table
until the optional redemption date and thereafter at the floating rates specified in the above
table until the corresponding scheduled maturity date. Distributions on the trust preferred
securities are cumulative and based upon the liquidation value of the trust preferred security.
The trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon
repayment of the junior subordinated debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption. The junior
subordinated debentures are redeemable in whole or in part at Bluegreen&#146;s option at any time after
five years from the issue date or sooner following certain specified events. In addition,
Bluegreen made an initial equity contribution to each Trust in exchange for its common securities,
all of which are owned by Bluegreen, and those proceeds were also used to purchase an identical
amount of junior subordinated debentures from Bluegreen. The terms of each trust&#146;s common
securities are nearly identical to the trust preferred securities.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company has formed thirteen statutory business trusts (&#147;Trusts&#148;)
for the purpose of issuing Trust Preferred Securities (&#147;trust preferred securities&#148;) and investing
the proceeds thereof in junior subordinated debentures of BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company. The
trust preferred securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent
Company. The Trusts used the proceeds from issuing trust preferred securities and the issuance of
its common securities to BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company to purchase junior subordinated
debentures from BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company. Interest on the junior subordinated
debentures and distributions on the trust preferred securities are payable quarterly in arrears.
Distributions on the trust preferred securities are cumulative and are based upon the liquidation
value of the trust preferred security. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company has the right, at any
time, as long as there are no continuing events of default, to defer payments of interest on the
junior subordinated debentures for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarters; but not beyond
the stated maturity of the junior subordinated debentures. Beginning in February and March&nbsp;2009
BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company notified the trustees of the junior subordinated debentures
that it has elected to defer interest payments for the next regularly scheduled quarterly interest
payment dates and BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company has continued to elect to defer interest
payments for each subsequent quarterly interest payment date. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company
has the ability under the junior subordinated debentures to continue to defer interest payments
through ongoing, appropriate notices to each of the trustees, and make a decision each quarter as
to whether to continue the deferral of interest. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company currently
expects to continue to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures for the
foreseeable future. During the deferral period, interest will continue to accrue on the junior
subordinated debentures at the stated coupon rate, including on the deferred interest, and
BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company will continue to record the interest expense associated with
the junior subordinated debentures. During the deferral period, BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent
Company may not, among other things and with limited exceptions, pay cash dividends on or
repurchase its common stock nor make any payment on outstanding debt obligations that rank equally
with or junior to the junior subordinated debentures. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company may end
the deferral by paying all accrued and unpaid interest. Deferred interest on junior subordinated
debentures was $28.2&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 as BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company elected
to defer interest during each quarter of 2010 and 2009. The trust preferred securities are subject
to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the junior subordinated debentures
at maturity or their earlier redemption. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company has the right to

tax-exempt bond financing to fund construction or acquisition of certain on-site and off-site
infrastructure improvements near or at these communities. The obligation to pay principal and
interest on the bonds issued by the districts was assigned to each parcel within the district, and
a priority assessment lien was sometimes placed on benefited parcels to provide security for the
debt service. The bonds, including interest and redemption premiums, if any, and the associated
priority lien on the property was typically payable, secured and satisfied by revenues, fees, or
assessments levied on the property benefited. Core was required to pay the revenues, fees, and
assessments levied by the districts on any properties it owned that benefited by the improvements.</DIV>

2010, Core no longer owns any property within community development, special assessment, or
improvement districts and was released from all debt obligations associated therewith. Core&#146;s bond
financing at December&nbsp;31, 2009 consisted of district bonds totaling $218.7&nbsp;million which was
scheduled to mature from 2035 to 2040, with then outstanding amounts of approximately $170.8

<b>BFC Financial Corporation <br>
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</b></div>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Generally, the amount of tax expense or benefit allocated to continuing operations is
determined without regard to the tax effects of other categories of income or loss, such as other
comprehensive income. However, an exception to the
general rule is provided when, in the presence of a valuation allowance against deferred tax
assets, there is a pretax loss from continuing operations and pretax income from other categories.
In such instances, income from other categories must offset the current loss from operations, the
tax benefit of such offset being reflected in continuing operations. The Company reduced its
deferred tax valuation allowance from continuing operations by $2.8&nbsp;million during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009 of which approximately $2.3&nbsp;million was due to BankAtlantic Bancorp and $517,000
was due to BFC to reflect the future taxable income associated with unrealized gains in accumulated other
comprehensive income. In 2010, BFC reduced its deferred tax valuation allowance from continuing
operations by $1.3&nbsp;million to reflect the future taxable income associated with BFC&#146;s unrealized
gains in accumulated other comprehensive income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC and its subsidiaries evaluate their deferred tax assets to determine if valuation
allowances are required. In the evaluation, management considers net operating loss carryback
availability, expectations of sufficient future taxable income, trends in earnings, existence of
taxable income in recent years, the future reversal of temporary differences, and available tax
planning strategies that could be implemented, if required. Valuation allowances are established
based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard. Based
on evaluations, deferred tax valuation allowances of $67.2&nbsp;million, $44.9&nbsp;million and $190.5
million were established for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be reversed when each of the companies and
their respective subsidiaries generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize the tax
benefits of the related deferred tax assets. The majority of the benefits of the net deferred tax
assets can be carried forward for 20&nbsp;years and applied to offset future taxable income. The
deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be reversed if and when it becomes more likely than not
that BFC and its subsidiaries will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize the
tax benefits of the related deferred tax assets.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2009, the Workers, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 was enacted.
The act extended the net operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;) carry-back period from two years to up to five
years for the 2008 or the 2009 tax years. Included in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of
Financial Condition at December&nbsp;31, 2009 was a current income tax receivable of $31.8 resulting
from BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s election to carryback its 2009 NOL for five years, which  was received in
2010. Also included in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at December
31, 2010 and 2009 are current income tax receivables of $10.8&nbsp;million and $34.6&nbsp;million,
respectively, resulting from Woodbridge&#146;s election to carryback its 2008 NOL for five years. We
have received approximately $29.2&nbsp;million of tax refunds and expect to receive an additional $10.8
million when the final review is completed by the Internal Revenue Service. Under the terms of the
Settlement Agreement entered into with the Joint Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the Chapter&nbsp;11
Cases, we agreed to share with the Debtors&#146; Estate a portion of the tax refund attributable to
periods prior to the bankruptcy. Accordingly, a liability of $11.7&nbsp;million, which is the amount
estimated to be due to the Debtors&#146; Estate under the Settlement Agreement, was established. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, $8.4
million of the $11.7&nbsp;million portion of the tax refund to be paid to the Debtors&#146; Estate was
received and placed in an escrow account. The $8.4&nbsp;million amount is included as restricted cash in
the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recognition of these unrecognized tax benefits would result in a negligible impact to
the Company&#146;s consolidated effective tax rates for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and
2008. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in
tax expense.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries file consolidated U.S. federal and Florida income tax
returns. BFC and its subsidiaries file separate state income tax returns for each jurisdiction,
other than Florida. Subsidiaries in which BFC owns less than 80% of the outstanding equity are not
included in BFC&#146;s consolidated U.S. federal or Florida income tax return. Upon consummation of the
merger with Woodbridge on September&nbsp;21, 2009, Woodbridge became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC
and its activities are included in the Company&#146;s consolidated tax return from the date of the
merger. Prior to the merger, Woodbridge was not included in the Company&#146;s consolidated tax return.
As BFC owns less than 80% of BankAtlantic Bancorp, Bluegreen and Pizza Fusion, those companies are
not included in BFC&#146;s consolidated tax return. BFC&#146;s deferred tax assets and liabilities, including
net operating loss carryforwards are specific to BFC and may not be utilized by BankAtlantic
Bancorp, Bluegreen or Pizza Fusion.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, BFC (excluding BankAtlantic Bancorp, pre-merger Woodbridge, Bluegreen
and Pizza Fusion) had estimated state and federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$266.6&nbsp;million (which expire from 2011 through 2030). A valuation allowance was
established for these NOLs. BFC&#146;s NOL carryforwards include approximately $12.3&nbsp;million that are
attributed to the exercise of stock options, and the tax benefits will be recognized in the
financial statements until such deductions are utilized to reduce taxes payable. As a result of
the merger of Woodbridge into BFC in September of 2009, BFC has likely undergone a &#147;change of
ownership&#148; as that term is defined in the Internal Revenue Code. This change of ownership resulted
in a significant limitation of the amount of BFC&#146;s pre-merger net operating losses that can be
utilized by BFC annually. Of the total net operating loss carryforward, approximately $83.0&nbsp;million
were generated by BFC prior to our merger with Woodbridge. However, Woodbridge&#146;s pre-merger NOL&#146;s
are available to be used by BFC and are not subject to this limitation. On September&nbsp;21, 2009, BFC
adopted the rights agreement described in note 31 in these financial statements in an attempt to
protect our ability to use available NOLs to offset future taxable income.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC&#146;s shift in business strategy, coupled with more recent economic developments, caused BFC
to reconsider its previously disclosed tax planning strategy wherein BFC had intended to sell
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock in order to generate sufficient taxable income to
utilize expiring NOLs. Because BFC believes that its best long term potential is more likely to
occur through the growth of the companies it controls, BFC&#146;s current business strategy is to hold
its investment in BankAtlantic Bancorp indefinitely and no longer intends to pursue such a tax
planning strategy. Accordingly, based on BFC&#146;s change in intent as to the expected manner of
recovery of its investment in BankAtlantic Bancorp, BFC reversed its deferred tax liability of
$29.3&nbsp;million during the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2008. BFC has the ability and intent to
increase its ownership in BankAtlantic Bancorp to a level sufficient to effectuate a tax-free
transaction. BFC also concluded that a valuation allowance was required because based on available
evidence it was determined that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred
tax asset will</DIV>

benefit of the deferred tax asset. Therefore, BFC established a valuation allowance of
approximately $28.3&nbsp;million in 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September&nbsp;21, 2009, the date on which its merger with BFC was consummated, Woodbridge
had federal and Florida NOL carryforwards of approximately $105.3&nbsp;million and $211.0&nbsp;million,
respectively, which expire beginning in 2027 through 2029. Woodbridge had established a valuation
allowance for its entire deferred tax assets, net of the deferred tax liabilities.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the merger, Woodbridge was subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as to income
tax in multiple state jurisdictions. Woodbridge is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state and
local income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2005. In January of 2009,
Woodbridge received a letter from the IRS stating that Woodbridge and its subsidiaries have been
selected for an examination of the tax periods ending December&nbsp;31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. In August
of 2008, Woodbridge received $29.7&nbsp;million from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)&nbsp;in connection
with the filing of a refund claim for the carry back to 2005 and 2006 of tax losses incurred in
2007. The examination of the 2007 tax refund claim was completed in May of 2010 with no changes.
In April of 2010, both BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge were notified by the IRS that it would
examine the 2009 and 2008 tax refund claims, respectively. Both examinations are in process and
are expected to be concluded in 2011. While there is no assurance as to the results of these
examinations, it is not currently anticipated that there will be any material adjustments to the
refund claims.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen and its subsidiaries file income tax return in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and
various states and foreign jurisdictions. With certain exceptions, Bluegreen is no longer subject
to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years
before 2006. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen has federal NOL carryforwards related to continuing
operations of approximately $150.4&nbsp;million, which expire beginning in 2022 through 2029, and
alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $38&nbsp;million, which never expire. Additionally, as
of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Bluegreen had state operating loss carryforwards of approximately $460.7
million, which expire beginning in 2012 through 2030.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2011, Bluegreen received notice from the Minnesota Department of Revenue that
Bluegreen Corporation&#146;s Franchise Tax Returns for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 through 2009
were selected for audit. The audit field work has not yet been scheduled. While there is no
assurance as to the results of the audit, Bluegreen does not currently anticipate any material
adjustments in connection with this examination.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pizza Fusion files separate U.S. Federal and Florida income tax returns and is no longer
subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examination by tax authorities for years before
2006. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Pizza Fusion&#146;s U.S. Federal and state NOL carryforwards was
approximately $6&nbsp;million which expire from 2027 through 2030.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return but
separate state income tax returns. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s state NOL carryforwards were $728.1
million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and expire from 2016 through 2030. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s income
tax returns for all years subsequent to the 2003 tax year are subject to examination. Various state
jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s 2003 through 2009 federal
income tax returns are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service, and no other
income tax filings are under examination by any other taxing authority.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to December&nbsp;31, 1996, BankAtlantic was permitted to deduct from taxable income an
allowance for bad debts which was in excess of the provision for such losses charged to income.
Accordingly, at December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic Bancorp had $21.5&nbsp;million of excess allowance for
bad debts for which no provision for income tax has been provided. If, in the future, this portion
of retained earnings is distributed, or BankAtlantic no longer qualifies as a bank for tax
purposes, federal income tax of approximately $7.5&nbsp;million would be realized.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, deferred tax assets included $320.8&nbsp;million, the amount of
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s federal income tax NOL carry-forwards of which $69.6&nbsp;million expire in 2028,
$67.3&nbsp;million expire in 2029, and $183.9&nbsp;million expire in 2030. BankAtlantic Bancorp federal tax
credit carry-forwards were $2.1&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010 and expire from 2025 to 2029.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At June&nbsp;30, 2009, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC/CCC, Inc. (&#147;BFC/CCC&#148;), had a 10% interest
in a limited partnership as a non-managing general partner. The partnership owns an office building
located in Boca Raton, Florida. In connection with the purchase of the office building in March
2006, BFC/CCC guaranteed repayment of a portion of the non-recourse loan on the property on a joint
and several basis with the managing general partner. BFC/CCC&#146;s maximum exposure under this
guarantee agreement is $2.0&nbsp;million (which is shared on a joint and several basis with the managing
general partner). In July&nbsp;2009, BFC/CCC&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary withdrew as partner of the
limited partnership and transferred its 10% interest to another unaffiliated partner. In return,
the partner to whom this interest was assigned agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the release of BFC/CCC from the guarantee. The partner was unable to secure such a release and that
partner has agreed to indemnify BFC/CCC&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary for any losses that may arise
under the guarantee after the date of the assignment. There are no carrying amounts on our
financial statements at December&nbsp;31, 2010 for this joint venture.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC/CCC has a 10% interest in a limited liability company that
owned two commercial properties in Hillsborough County, Florida. During the fourth quarter of 2010,
the limited liability company recorded an impairment charge related to these properties, $1.9
million of which was recognized by BFC/CCC&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary. The $1.9&nbsp;million impairment
charge exceeded the carrying value of our investment. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company classified
the negative basis of the investment of approximately $1.3&nbsp;million in other liabilities on the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the carrying amount
of this investment was approximately $690,000, and is included as an asset in investments in
unconsolidated affiliates in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. In
connection with the purchase of the commercial properties in November&nbsp;2006, BFC and the
unaffiliated member each guaranteed the payment of up to a maximum of $5.0&nbsp;million for certain
environmental indemnities and specific obligations that are not related to the financial
performance of the assets. BFC and the unaffiliated member also entered into a cross
indemnification agreement which limits BFC&#146;s obligations under the guarantee to acts of BFC and its
affiliates. On March&nbsp;25, 2011, the limited liability company reached a settlement with its lender
and has conveyed the commercial properties securing the loan via a deed in lieu of foreclosure. BFC
and BFC/CCC&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary were released from all obligations and guarantees related to
the two commercial properties.

partnership that has a 10% interest in a limited liability company that owns an office building in
Tampa, Florida. At December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying amount of this investment was
approximately $282,000 and $319,000, respectively, which is included in investments in
unconsolidated affiliates in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. In
connection with the purchase of the office building by the limited liability company in June&nbsp;2007,
BFC guaranteed the payment of certain environmental indemnities and specific obligations that are
not related to the financial performance of the asset up to a maximum of $15.0&nbsp;million, or $25.0
million in the event of any petition or involuntary proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or
similar state insolvency laws or in the event of any transfer of interests not in accordance with
the loan documents. BFC and the unaffiliated members also entered into a cross indemnification
agreement which limits BFC&#146;s obligations under the guarantee to acts of BFC and its affiliates. No
amounts are recorded in the Company&#146;s financial statements for the obligations associated with this
guarantee based on the potential indemnification by unaffiliated members and the limit of the
specific obligations to non-financial matters.

$33.3&nbsp;million of surety bonds related to its ongoing projects at November&nbsp;9, 2007, the date on
which Levitt and Sons and substantially all of its subsidiaries filed voluntary bankruptcy
petitions (the &#147;Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases&#148;). In the event that these obligations are drawn and paid by the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">December&nbsp;31, 2009, Woodbridge had $490,000 and $527,000, respectively, in surety bond accruals
related to certain bonds where management believes it to be probable that Woodbridge will be
required to reimburse the surety under applicable indemnity agreements. Woodbridge reimbursed the
surety approximately $348,000 and $532,000 during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, in accordance with the indemnity agreement for bond claims paid during the period. No
reimbursements were made in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. It is unclear whether and to what
extent the remaining outstanding surety bonds of Levitt and Sons will be drawn and the extent to
which Woodbridge may be responsible for additional amounts beyond the previous accrued amount.
Woodbridge will not receive any repayment, assets or other consideration as recovery of any amounts
it may be required to pay. In September&nbsp;2008, a surety filed a lawsuit to require Woodbridge to
post collateral against a portion of surety bond exposure in connection with demands made by a
municipality. While Woodbridge did not believe that the municipality had the right to demand
payment under the bonds. Based on claims by the municipality on the bonds, the surety requested
that Woodbridge post a $4.0&nbsp;million escrow deposit while the matter was being litigated with the
municipality and Woodbridge complied with that request. In August&nbsp;2010, a motion for summary
judgment was entered in Woodbridge&#146;s favor terminating any obligations under the bonds. The
municipality has appealed the decision.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;20, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court presiding over the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases entered an
order confirming a plan of liquidation jointly proposed by Levitt and Sons and the Official
Committee of Unsecured Creditors. That order also approved the settlement pursuant to the
settlement agreement that was entered into with the Joint Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the
&#147;Settlement Agreement&#148;). No appeal or rehearing of the Bankruptcy Court&#146;s order was filed by any
party, and the settlement was consummated on March&nbsp;3, 2009, at which time payment was made in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement as amended. Under cost method
accounting, the cost of settlement and the related $52.9&nbsp;million liability (less $500,000 which was
determined as the settlement holdback and remained as an accrual pursuant to the settlement
agreement) was recognized into income in the first quarter of 2009, resulting in a $40.4&nbsp;million
gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, we agreed to
share a percentage of any tax refund attributable to periods prior to the bankruptcy with the
Debtors Estate. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we accrued approximately $10.7&nbsp;million in connection
with the portion of the tax refund which may be payable to the Debtors Estate pursuant to the
settlement agreement. As a result, the gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 was reduced to $29.7&nbsp;million. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2010,
we increased the $10.7&nbsp;million accrual by approximately $1.0&nbsp;million, representing a portion of an
additional tax refund which we expect to receive due to a recent change in Internal Revenue Service
(&#147;IRS&#148;) guidance that will likely be required to be paid to the Debtors Estate pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement. We have placed into escrow approximately $8.4&nbsp;million, which represents the
portion of the tax refund received to date from the Internal Revenue Service that would be payable
to the Debtors Estate under the Settlement Agreement. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, this amount is included
as restricted cash in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, under Florida law, holders of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock who
did not vote to approve the merger between Woodbridge and BFC and properly asserted and exercised
their appraisal rights with respect to their shares (&#147;Dissenting Holders&#148;) are entitled to receive
a cash payment in an amount equal to the fair value of their shares as determined in accordance
with the provisions of Florida law in lieu of the shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock that they
would otherwise have been entitled to receive. Dissenting Holders, who collectively held
approximately 4.2&nbsp;million shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, have rejected Woodbridge&#146;s
offer of $1.10 per share and requested payment for their shares based on their respective fair
value estimates of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. Litigation with respect to the appraisal
process is currently ongoing. In December&nbsp;2009, a $4.6&nbsp;million liability was recorded with a
corresponding reduction to additional paid-in capital, which is reflected in the Company&#146;s
Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition representing in the aggregate Woodbridge&#146;s offer to
the Dissenting Holders. However, outcome of the appraisal rights litigation is uncertain. There
is no assurance as to the amount of cash that we will be required to pay to the Dissenting Holders,
and such amount may be greater than the $4.6&nbsp;million that we have accrued.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend funds to a customer subject to conditions
established in the commitment. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future
cash requirements at December&nbsp;31, 2010. BankAtlantic has $20.1&nbsp;million of commitments to extend
credit at a fixed interest rate and $360.9&nbsp;million of commitments to extend credit at a variable
rate. BankAtlantic evaluates each customer&#146;s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount
of collateral required by BankAtlantic in connection with an extension of credit is based on
management&#146;s credit evaluation of the counter-party.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by BankAtlantic to guarantee the
performance of a customer to a third party. BankAtlantic standby letters of credit are generally
issued to customers in the construction industry guaranteeing project performance. These types of
standby letters of credit had a maximum exposure of $8.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010.
BankAtlantic also issues standby letters of credit to commercial lending customers guaranteeing the
payment of goods and services. These types of standby letters of credit had a maximum exposure of
$1.5&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and
private borrowing arrangements and generally have maturities of one year or less. The credit risk
involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan
facilities to customers. BankAtlantic may hold certificates of deposit and residential and
commercial liens as collateral for such commitments which are collateralized similar to other types
of borrowings. Included in other liabilities at December&nbsp;31, 2010 was $34,000 of unearned
guarantee fees.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserves are accrued for matters in which it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the
amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. These accrual amounts as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 are
not material to the Company&#146;s financial statements. The actual costs of resolving these legal
claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for these claims.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A range of reasonably possible losses is estimated for matters in which it is reasonably
possible that a loss has been incurred or that a loss is probable but not reasonably estimable.
Management of BankAtlantic Bancorp currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible
losses as $9.9&nbsp;million to $45.6&nbsp;million in excess of the accrued liability relating to these legal
matters. This estimated range of reasonably possible losses represents the estimated possible
losses over the life of such legal matters, which may span a currently indeterminable number of
years, and is based on information currently available as of December&nbsp;31, 2010. The matters
underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary
significantly from this estimate. Those matters for which a reasonable estimate is not possible
are not included within this estimated range and, therefore, this estimated range does not
represent BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s maximum loss exposure.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain matters BankAtlantic Bancorp is unable to estimate the loss or reasonable range of
loss until additional developments in the case provide information sufficient to support an
assessment of the loss or range of loss. Frequently in these matters the claims are broad and the
plaintiffs&#146; have not quantified or factually supported the claim.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp believes that liabilities arising from litigation and regulatory matters,
discussed below, in excess of the amounts currently accrued, if any, will not have a material
impact to the financial statements. However, due to the significant uncertainties involved in these
legal matters, BankAtlantic Bancorp may incur losses in excess of accrued amounts and an adverse
outcome in these matters could be material to BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is a description of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s ongoing litigation and regulatory
matters:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Class action securities litigation</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2007, BankAtlantic Bancorp and current or former officers of BankAtlantic Bancorp
were named in a lawsuit which alleges that during the period of November&nbsp;9, 2005 through October
25, 2007, BankAtlantic Bancorp and the named officers knowingly and/or recklessly made
misrepresentations of material fact regarding BankAtlantic and specifically BankAtlantic&#146;s loan
portfolio and allowance for loan losses. The Complaint seeks to assert claims for violations of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule&nbsp;10b-5 and seeks unspecified damages. On November&nbsp;18,
2010, a jury returned a verdict awarding $2.41 per share to shareholders who purchased shares
of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock during the period of April&nbsp;26, 2007 to October&nbsp;26,
2007 who retained those shares until the end of the period. The jury rejected the plaintiffs&#146;
claim for the six month period from October&nbsp;19, 2006 to April&nbsp;25, 2007. Prior to the beginning of
the trial, the plaintiffs abandoned any claim for any prior period. BankAtlantic Bancorp has filed
motions to set aside the verdict and the judge has indicated that if those are denied she will
certify the jury verdict to the United States Court of Appeals to the Eleventh Circuit before any
judgment is entered or claims process is commenced.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp, certain officers and Directors were named in a lawsuit
which alleges that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in certain
lending practices with respect to BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Commercial Real Estate Loan Portfolio. The
Complaint further alleges that BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s public filings and statements did not fully
disclose the risks associated with the Commercial Real Estate Loan Portfolio and seeks damages on
behalf of BankAtlantic Bancorp. The case has been stayed pending final resolution of the class
action securities litigation.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Class&nbsp;Action Overdraft Processing Litigation</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2010, the two pending class action complaints against BankAtlantic associated with
overdraft fees were consolidated. The Complaint, which asserts claims for breach of contract and
breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, alleges that BankAtlantic improperly
re-sequenced debit card transactions from largest to smallest, improperly assessed overdraft fees
on positive balances, and improperly imposed sustained overdraft fees on customers. BankAtlantic
has filed a motion to dismiss which is pending with the Court.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Office of Thrift Supervision Overdraft Processing Investigation</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;6, 2011, the Office of Thrift Supervision advised BankAtlantic that it had
determined, subject to receipt of additional information from BankAtlantic, that BankAtlantic had
engaged in deceptive and unfair practices in violation of Section&nbsp;5 of the Federal Trade Commission
Act, relating to certain of BankAtlantic&#146;s deposit-related products. The OTS provided BankAtlantic
the opportunity to respond with any additional or clarifying information, and BankAtlantic
submitted a written response to the OTS on February&nbsp;7, 2011 addressing the OTS&#146;s position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Securities and Exchange Commission Investigation</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp has received a notice of investigation from the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Miami Regional Office and subpoenas for information. The subpoenas request a broad
range of documents relating to, among other matters, recent and pending litigation to which
BankAtlantic Bancorp is or was a party, certain of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s non-performing,
non-accrual and charged-off loans, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s cost saving measures, loan
classifications, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s asset workout subsidiary and the recent
Orders with the OTS entered into by BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company and BankAtlantic. Various
current and former employees have also received subpoenas for documents and testimony.
BankAtlantic Bancorp is fully cooperating with the SEC.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC has a share based compensation plan (the &#147;2005 Stock Incentive Plan&#148;) under which
restricted stock, incentive stock options and non-qualifying stock options are awarded. On May&nbsp;19,
2009, the shareholders of BFC approved an amendment to the Company&#146;s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan to,
among other things, increase the maximum number of shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
available for grant under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan from 3,000,000 shares to 6,000,000 shares.
BFC may grant incentive stock options only to its employees. BFC may grant non-qualified stock
options and restricted stock awards to its directors, independent contractors and agents as well as
employees.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC also had a stock-based compensation plan (&#147;1993 Plan&#148;) which expired in 2004. No future
grants can be made under the 1993 Plan; however, any previously issued options granted under that
plan remain effective until either they expire, are forfeited, or are exercised. BFC&#146;s 1993 Plan
provided for the grant of stock options to purchase shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;B Common Stock. The 1993
Plan provided for the grant of both incentive stock options and non-qualifying options and the maximum term of the options was ten years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 1.8&nbsp;million shares of
common stock, which were previously granted to and held by BFC&#146;s directors and employees, were
re-priced to a new exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
as quoted on the Pink Sheets Electronic Quotation Service on September&nbsp;21, 2009. The re-pricing did
not impact any of the other terms, including the vesting schedules or expiration dates, of the
previously granted stock options. The incremental compensation cost of the re-priced vested options
was approximately $157,000 which was recognized in September&nbsp;2009. The remaining incremental cost
for the re-priced options that were unvested at the re-pricing date was approximately $125,000, of
which approximately $85,000 was recognized in 2010 and $32,000 and $8,000 will be recognized in
2011 and 2012, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, on September&nbsp;21, 2009, following the Woodbridge merger, new options to purchase
an aggregate of 753,254 shares of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.41 per share,
the closing price of a share of the stock on the grant date, were granted principally to
Woodbridge&#146;s directors, executive officers and employees. The weighted average estimated fair value
of the options granted on September&nbsp;21, 2009 was approximately $0.22 per share and the resulting
compensation cost of approximately $166,000 is expected to be recognized over the requisite service
period of four years. The options expire in five years and the options will vest in four equal
annual installments, with the first such installment having vested on September&nbsp;21, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assumptions used in estimating the fair value of employee options granted were formulated in
accordance with FASB guidance under stock compensation and applicable guidance provided by the SEC.
As part of this assessment, management determined that volatility should be based on the Company&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and derived from historical price volatility over the estimated life of the
stock options granted. The expected term of an option is an estimate as to how long the option will
remain outstanding based upon management&#146;s expectation of employee exercise and post-vesting
forfeiture behavior. Because there were no recognizable patterns, the simplified guidance was used
to determine the estimated term of options based on the midpoint of the vesting term and the
contractual term. The estimate of a risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury implied
yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a remaining term equal to the expected term. BFC
has never paid cash dividends and does not currently intend to pay cash dividends on its common
stock. In addition, BFC has committed not to pay dividends on its common stock without the prior
written non-objection of the OTS. Therefore, a 0% dividend yield was assumed. Share-based
compensation costs are recognized based on the grant date fair value. The grant date fair value for
stock options is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model net of an estimated
forfeitures rate and recognizes the compensation costs for those options expected to vest on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. BFC based its estimated
forfeiture rate of its unvested options on its historical experience.

and the stock options which were granted during 2009 and 2008 was the Black-Scholes model. The table below
presents the weighted average assumptions used to value such options. There were no options granted
to employees or non-employee directors during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010, and no option were granted to employees during
the year ended december 31, 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC recognized restricted stock compensation cost of approximately $0, $42,000 and $100,000
for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2008, the Board of Directors granted to non-employee directors an aggregate of 120,480
shares of restricted stock under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan. Restricted stock was granted in
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and vested monthly over a twelve-month service period. The fair value of the
120,480 shares of restricted stock was approximately $100,000, and the cost was recognized over the
12&nbsp;month service period from June&nbsp;2008 through May&nbsp;2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><I>Woodbridge Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan Prior to the Merger</I></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to its merger with BFC, Woodbridge had in place a stock compensation plan. The maximum
term of options granted under the plan was 10&nbsp;years. The vesting period for each grant was
established by the Compensation Committee of Woodbridge&#146;s Board of Directors. The vesting period
for employees was generally five years utilizing cliff vesting. All options granted to directors
vested immediately. Option awards issued became exercisable based solely on fulfilling a service
condition. As of the date of the merger, no stock options granted under the plan had expired.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon consummation of the merger on September&nbsp;21, 2009, all options to purchase shares of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock outstanding at the effective time of the merger were canceled and
the holders did not receive any consideration as a result of the cancellation. Restricted shares
of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock were converted to restricted shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock at the merger exchange ratio of 3.47 shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock for each share of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. Some of the directors, executive officers and employees of
Woodbridge were also granted BFC stock options following the merger, as described above.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of Woodbridge&#146;s stock. Due to the
short period of time that Woodbridge&#146;s stock was publicly traded, the historical volatilities of
similar publicly traded entities were reviewed to validate Woodbridge&#146;s expected volatility
assumption. The expected dividend yield was based on an expected quarterly dividend.
Historically, forfeiture rates were estimated based on historical employee turnover rates. In 2007
and 2008, there were substantial pre-vesting forfeitures as a result of the reductions in force
related to the bankruptcy of Levitt and Sons and Woodbridge&#146;s restructurings. As a result,
Woodbridge adjusted its stock compensation to reflect actual forfeitures. In accordance with the
accounting guidance for stock compensation, pre-vesting forfeitures result in a reversal of
compensation cost whereas a post-vesting cancellation would not.

aggregate amount of $991,000 and $840,000, respectively. Non-cash stock compensation expense for
2009 and 2008 included $1.5&nbsp;million and $2.1&nbsp;million, respectively, of amortization of stock option
compensation, offset by $458,000 and $1.3&nbsp;million, respectively, of a reversal of stock
compensation previously expensed related to forfeited options. Non-cash stock compensation expense
for 2009 and 2008 related to restricted stock awards in the aggregate amount of $88,000 and

Bancorp Class&nbsp;A common stock may be issued for restricted stock awards and upon the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp recognizes stock based compensation costs based on the grant date
fair value. The grant date fair value for stock options is calculated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model incorporating an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizes the compensation
costs for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period
of the award, which is generally the option vesting term of five years.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s stock price exhibited higher
volatility than its peer group. As a consequence, management began using its historical volatility
as an indicator of future volatility. As part of its adoption of new accounting guidance on
January&nbsp;1, 2006, BankAtlantic Bancorp examined its historical pattern of option exercises in an
effort to determine if there were any patterns based on certain employee populations. From this
analysis, BankAtlantic Bancorp could not identify any employee population patterns in the exercise
of its options. As such, BankAtlantic Bancorp used the guidance of SAB 107 to determine the
estimated term of options issued subsequent to the adoption new accounting guidance. Based on this
guidance, the estimated term was deemed to be the midpoint of the vesting term and the contractual
term ((vesting term &#043; original contractual term)/2).

employees and directors during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. There were no options granted to
employees or directors during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2010, BankAtlantic Bancorp Board of Directors granted to its employees 1,600,000
restricted shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;A Common Stock awards (&#147;RSA&#148;) under the
BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. 2005 Restricted Stock and Option Plan. BankAtlantic Bancorp Board of
Directors also granted 75,000 RSAs to employees of BFC that perform services for BankAtlantic
Bancorp. The grant date fair value was calculated based on the closing price of BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock on the grant date. The RSAs vest pro-rata over four years and had a
fair value of $1.24 per share at the grant date.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested
restricted stock compensation was approximately $1.6&nbsp;million. The cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 3&nbsp;years. The fair value of shares
vested during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $15,000, $19,000, and $90,000
respectively.

April&nbsp;18, 2009, the employer match was suspended due to economic conditions. During the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, BFC&#146;s contributions amounted to $0, $49,000 and $118,000,
respectively.

retirement benefit payment, as actuarially determined, in the amount of $482,444, payable as a life
annuity with 120 payments at 6.5% interest.
The interest on the retirement benefit is recognized monthly as compensation expense. At December
31, 2010 and 2009, the deferred retirement obligation balance was approximately $611,000 and
$635,000, respectively, which represents the present value of accumulated benefit obligation and is
included in other liabilities in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition. The
compensation expense for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately
$41,000, $37,000 and $38,000, respectively. Mr.&nbsp;Gilbert retired as Chief Financial Officer on March
29, 2007.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;29, 2008, Woodbridge&#146;s Board of Directors approved the terms of an incentive
program for certain employees, including certain executive officers, pursuant to which a portion of
their compensation may be based on the cash returns realized on investments held by individual
limited partnerships or other legal entities. Certain of the participants in this incentive
program are also employees and executive officers of BFC. This incentive program qualifies as a
liability-based plan and, accordingly, the components of the program are required to be evaluated
in order to determine the estimated fair value of the liability, if any, to be recorded. Based on
the evaluation performed at December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, it was determined that the liability for
compensation under the executive compensation program as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 was not
material.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen&#146;s Employee Retirement Plan is an Internal Revenue Code section 401(k) Retirement
Savings Plan (the &#147;Bluegreen Plan&#148;). All U.S.-based employees at least 21&nbsp;years of age with one
year of employment with Bluegreen and 1,000 work hours are eligible to participate in the Bluegreen
Plan. The Bluegreen Plan provides an annual employer discretionary matching contribution. During
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and for the Bluegreen Interim Period, Bluegreen did not make any
contributions to the Bluegreen Plan.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five of Bluegreen&#146;s employees in New Jersey are subject to the terms of collective bargaining
agreements. These employees are located in New Jersey and comprise less than 1% of Bluegreen&#146;s
total workforce.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 1998, BankAtlantic froze its defined benefit pension plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;). All
participants in the Plan ceased accruing service benefits beyond that date and became vested.
BankAtlantic Bancorp is subject to future pension expense or income based on future actual plan
returns and actuarial values of the Plan obligations to employees.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actuarial estimates and assumptions are based on various market factors and are evaluated on
an annual basis, and changes in such assumptions may impact future pension costs. The discount rate
assumption is based on rates of high quality corporate bonds. The expected long-term rate of
return was estimated using historical long-term returns based on the expected asset allocations.
Current participant data was used for the actuarial assumptions for each of the three years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010. BankAtlantic Bancorp contributed $0.8&nbsp;million to the BankAtlantic Plan during
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2101. BankAtlantic Bancorp did not make any contributions to the
BankAtlantic Plan during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008. It is anticipated that
BankAtlantic Bancorp will be required to contribute $0.5&nbsp;million to the BankAtlantic Plan for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2011.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan&#146;s investment policies and strategies are to invest in mutual funds that are rated
with at least a 3-star rating awarded by Morningstar at the initial purchase. If a fund&#146;s
Morningstar rating falls below a 3-star rating after an initial purchase, it is monitored to
determine that its under-performance can be attributed to market conditions rather than fund
management deficiencies. Fund manager changes or changes in fund objectives could be cause for
replacement of any mutual fund. The Plan also maintains an aggressive growth investment category
which includes investments in equity securities and mutual funds. Both public and private
securities are eligible for this category of investment, but no more than 5% of total Plan assets
at the time of the initial investment may be invested in any one company. Beyond the initial cost
limitation (5% at time of purchase), there is no limitation as to the percentage that any one
investment can represent if it is achieved through growth. As a means to reduce negative market
volatility and concentration, the Plan has a strategy of selling call options against certain stock
positions within the portfolio when considered timely. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2.5% of the Plan&#146;s
assets were invested in the aggressive growth category.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan&#146;s targeted asset allocation was 72% equity securities, 25% debt securities and 3%
cash during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. A rebalancing of the portfolio takes place on a
quarterly basis when there has been a 5% or greater change from the prevailing benchmark
allocation.

</DIV>


<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;7, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company designated 15,000 shares of the
Company&#146;s authorized preferred stock as 5% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (&#147;5% Preferred
Stock&#148;). On June&nbsp;21, 2004, the Company sold all 15,000 shares of the Preferred Stock to an investor
group in a private offering.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5% Preferred Stock has a stated value of $1,000 per share. The shares of 5% Preferred
Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Company, from time to time, at redemption prices (the
&#147;Redemption Price&#148;) ranging from $1,025 per share for the year 2010 to $1,000 per share for the
year 2015 and thereafter. The 5% Preferred Stock liquidation preference is equal to its stated
value of $1,000 per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends or an amount equal to the
Redemption Price in a voluntary liquidation or winding up of the Company. Holders of the 5%
Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors,
cumulative quarterly cash dividends on each such share at a rate per annum of 5% of the stated
value from the date of issuance, payable quarterly. Since June&nbsp;2004, the Company has paid quarterly
dividends on the 5% Preferred Stock of $187,500. The 5% Preferred Stock has no voting rights except
as required by Florida law.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;17, 2008, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation (the &#147;Amendment&#148;) to
change certain of the previously designated relative rights, preferences and limitations of the
Company&#146;s 5% Preferred Stock. The Amendment eliminated the right of the holders of the 5% Preferred
Stock to convert their shares of 5% Preferred Stock into shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock. The Amendment also requires the Company to redeem shares of the 5% Preferred Stock with the
net proceeds it receives in the event (i)&nbsp;the Company sells any of its shares of Benihana Series&nbsp;B
Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#147;Benihana Preferred Stock&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;the Company sells any shares of
Benihana&#146;s common stock received upon conversion of the Benihana Preferred Stock or (iii)&nbsp;Benihana
redeems any shares of the Benihana Preferred Stock owned by the Company. Additionally, in the
event the Company defaults on its obligation to make dividend payments on its 5% Preferred Stock,
the Amendment entitles the holders of the 5% Preferred Stock, in place of the Company, to receive directly from Benihana certain payments
on the shares of Benihana Preferred Stock owned by the Company or on the shares of Benihana&#146;s
common stock received by the Company upon conversion of the Benihana Preferred Stock.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2008, based on an analysis of BFC 5% Preferred Stock after giving effect to the
Amendment, the Company determined that BFC 5% Preferred Stock met the requirements to be
re-classified outside of permanent equity at its fair value at the Amendment date of approximately
$11.0&nbsp;million into the mezzanine category as Redeemable 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock. The
remaining amount of approximately $4.0&nbsp;million continued to be classified as Additional Paid in
Capital in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The fair value of the 5%
Preferred Stock was calculated by using an income approach by discounting estimated cash flows at a
market discount rate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, BFC adopted a rights agreement (&#147;Rights Agreement&#148;) designed to
preserve shareholder value and protect our ability to use available net operating loss (&#147;NOLs&#148;)
carryforwards. The Rights Agreement provides a deterrent to shareholders from acquiring a 5% or
greater ownership interest in BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock without the prior
approval of BFC&#146;s Board of Directors. Shareholders of BFC at September&nbsp;21, 2009 were not required
to divest any shares. The Rights Agreement was substantially similar to the rights agreement that
Woodbridge had in place prior to the consummation of its merger with BFC.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the consummation of BFC&#146;s merger with Woodbridge on September&nbsp;21, 2009,
BFC&#146;s Articles of Incorporation were amended to increase the number of authorized shares of BFC&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock from 100,000,000 shares to 150,000,000 shares. BFC also amended its Articles
of Incorporation on September&nbsp;21, 2009 to set forth the designation and number of preferred shares
as well as the relative rights, preferences and limitations of the preferred shares which may be
issued under the terms and conditions of the Rights Agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, BFC&#146;s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program which
authorizes the repurchase of up to 20,000,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock at an
aggregate cost of no more than $10&nbsp;million. This program replaces the $10&nbsp;million repurchase
program that BFC&#146;s Board of Directors approved in October&nbsp;2006 which placed a limitation on the
number of shares which could be repurchased under the program at 1,750,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, BFC repurchased 100,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock at an aggregate cost of $54,000 under the prior program. The current program, like the prior
program, authorizes management, at its discretion, to repurchase shares from time to time subject
to market conditions and other factors. No shares were repurchased during the year ended December
31, 2010 or 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Articles of Incorporation authorize the Company to issue both Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock, par value $.01 per share, and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, par value $.01 per share. Holders of
the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share held, with all holders
of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock possessing in the aggregate 22% of the total voting power. Holders of
Class&nbsp;B Common Stock possess the remaining 78% of the total voting power. When the number of shares
of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock outstanding decreases to 1,800,000 shares, the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock&#146;s
aggregate voting power will increase to 40% and the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock will have the remaining
60%. When the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock outstanding decreases to 1,400,000 shares,
the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock&#146;s aggregate voting power will increase to 53% and the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock
will have the remaining 47%. These relative voting percentages will remain fixed unless the number
of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock outstanding decreases to 500,000 shares or less, at which time
the fixed voting percentages will be eliminated, and holders of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and holders of
Class&nbsp;B Common Stock would then each be entitled to one vote per share held. Each share of Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock is convertible at the option of the holder thereof into one share of Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock.</DIV>

</DIV>


<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair value is defined as the price that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
There are three main valuation techniques to measuring fair value of assets and liabilities: the
market approach, the income approach and the cost approach. The accounting literature defines an
input fair value hierarchy that has three broad levels and gives the highest priority to quoted
prices (unadjusted)&nbsp;in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valuation techniques are summarized below:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income approach uses financial models to convert future amounts to a single present
amount. These valuation techniques include present value and option-pricing models.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the
service capacity of an asset. This technique is often referred to as current replacement costs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The input fair value hierarchy is summarized below:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted)&nbsp;in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at each reporting date. An active market for
the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. A quoted price
in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and is used to measure fair
value whenever available.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable
for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a
specified (contractual)&nbsp;term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of
the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in
active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are
not active, that is, markets in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the
prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market
makers (for example, some brokered markets), or in which little information is released publicly
(for example, a principal-to-principal market); and inputs other than quoted prices that are
observable for the asset or liability (for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at
commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and
default rates).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs
are only used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby
allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or
liability at the measurement date.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $1.6&nbsp;million equity securities loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 represents
an other-than-temporary impairment associated with a decline in value related to an equity
investment in an unrelated financial institution.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valuation techniques and the inputs used in our financial statements to measure the fair
value of our recurring financial instruments are described below.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair values of agency bonds, municipal bonds, taxable bonds, mortgage-backed and real
estate mortgage conduit securities (&#147;REMICS&#148;) are estimated using independent pricing sources and
matrix pricing. Matrix pricing uses a market approach valuation technique and Level 2 valuation
inputs as quoted market prices are not available for the specific securities that BankAtlantic
owns. The independent pricing sources value these securities using observable market inputs
including: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads and other
reference data in the secondary institutional market which is the principal market for these types
of assets. To validate fair values obtained from the pricing sources, BankAtlantic reviews fair
value estimates obtained from brokers, investment advisors and others to determine the
reasonableness of the fair values obtained from independent pricing sources. BankAtlantic reviews
any price that it determines may not be reasonable and requires the pricing sources to explain the
differences in fair value or reevaluate its fair value.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other bonds and equity securities are generally fair valued using the market approach and
quoted market prices (Level 1) or matrix pricing (Level 2 or Level 3) with inputs obtained from
independent pricing sources, if available. Also non-binding broker quotes are obtained to validate
fair values obtained from matrix pricing. However, certain equity and debt securities in which
observable market inputs cannot be obtained are valued either using the income approach and pricing
models that we have developed or based on observable market data that we adjust based on our
judgment of the factors we believe a market participant would use to value the securities (Level
3).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of foreign currency put options was obtained using the market approach and
quoted market prices using Level 1 inputs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impaired loans are generally valued based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.
Third party appraisals are primarily used to assist in non-homogenous impaired loans. These
appraisals generally use the market or income approach valuation technique and use market
observable data to formulate an opinion of the fair value of the loan&#146;s collateral. However, the
appraiser uses professional judgment in determining the fair value of the collateral or properties
and BankAtlantic may also adjust these values for changes in market conditions subsequent to the
appraisal date. When current appraisals are not available for certain loans, BankAtlantic uses
judgment on market conditions to adjust the most current appraisal. The sales prices may reflect
prices of sales contracts not closed and the amount of time required

projects. As a consequence, the calculation of the fair value of the collateral uses Level 3
inputs. Third party brokered price options or an automated valuation service are generally use to
measure the fair value of the collateral for impaired homogenous loans in the establishment of
specific reserves or charge-downs when these loans become 120&nbsp;days delinquent. These third party
valuations from real estate professionals also use Level 3 inputs in the determination of the fair
values.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real estate inventory and other long-lived real estate assets are evaluated for impairment in
accordance with the accounting guidance for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. In
accordance with this accounting guidance, long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an
asset to estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or by
using appraisals of the related assets. Using estimated future undiscounted cash flows or
appraisals requires significant judgment and opinions in developing estimates. Real estate and
assets held for sale may also be valued using third party offers to purchase the property,
discounted cash flows or broker price opinions. Appraisals generally use the market approach
valuation technique and use observable market data to formulate an opinion of the fair value of the
properties. However, the appraisers or brokers use professional judgments in determining the fair
value of the properties, and we may also adjust these values for changes in market conditions
subsequent to the valuation date. As a consequence of using appraisals, discounted cash flows,
broker price opinions, purchase offers and adjustments to appraisals, the fair values of the
properties use Level 3 inputs in the determination of fair value.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp used discounted cash flow valuation techniques in determining the fair
value of its reporting units in the test of goodwill for impairment. This method requires
assumptions for expected cash flows and applicable discount rates. The aggregate fair value of all
reporting units derived from the above valuation methodology was compared to BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
market capitalization adjusted for a control premium in order to determine the reasonableness of
the financial model output. A control premium represents the value an investor would pay above
minority interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective
company. BankAtlantic Bancorp used financial projections over a period of time considered
necessary to achieve a steady state of cash flows for each reporting unit. The primary assumptions
in the projections were anticipated loan, tax certificates and securities growth, interest rates
and revenue growth. The discount rates were estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model,
which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and unsystematic risk and
size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a
reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in the discount rate and terminal value assumptions
and, accordingly, minor changes in these assumptions could impact significantly the fair value
assigned to a reporting unit. Future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the
estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below
its carrying value. As a result of the significant judgments used in determining the fair value of
the reporting units, the fair values of the reporting units use Level 3 inputs in the determination
of fair value.

because there is no active market for many of these financial instruments and management has
derived the fair value of the majority of these financial instruments using the income approach
technique with Level 3 unobservable inputs, there is no assurance that the Company or its
subsidiaries would receive the estimated value upon sale or disposition of the asset or pay the
estimated value upon disposition of the liability in advance of its scheduled maturity. Management
estimates used in its net present value financial models rely on assumptions and judgments
regarding issues where the outcome is unknown and actual results or values may differ significantly
from these estimates. These fair value estimates do not consider the tax effect that would be
associated with the disposition of the assets or liabilities at their fair value estimates.

guaranteed by the FDIC with maturities of less than one year. Due to the FDIC guarantee and the
short maturity of these certificates of deposit, the fair value of these deposits approximates the
carrying value.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of tax certificates was calculated using the income approach with Level 3

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of performing loans is calculated by using an income approach with Level 3
inputs. The fair value of performing loans is estimated by discounting forecasted cash flows
through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect the interest rate
risk inherent in the loan portfolio. The estimate of average maturity is based on BankAtlantic&#146;s
historical experience with prepayments for each loan classification, modified as required, by an
estimate of the effect of current economic and lending conditions. Management assigns a credit risk

considering contractual payments and estimates of prepayments and defaults, discounted at a market

similar credit risk).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen&#146;s retained interests in VOI notes receivable sold were carried at fair value as of
December&nbsp;31, 2009. See Note 13 for additional information on the methods and assumptions used to
estimate the fair value of these financial instruments.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As permitted by applicable accounting guidance, the fair value of deposits with no stated
maturity, such as non-interest bearing demand deposits, savings and NOW accounts, and money market
and checking accounts, is shown in the above table at book value. The fair value of certificates
of deposit is based on an income approach with Level 3 inputs. The fair value is calculated by the
discounted value of contractual cash flows with the discount rate estimated using current rates
offered by BankAtlantic for similar remaining maturities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of short-term borrowings is calculated using the income approach with Level 2

of these borrowings approximates fair value as maturities are generally less than thirty days.

The fair value was based on discounted cash flows using rates offered for debt with comparable

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated fair values of notes and mortgage notes payable and other borrowings, including
receivable-backed notes payable, were based upon current rates and spreads a party would pay to
obtain similar borrowings. In addition, the fair value of BankAtlantic&#146;s mortgage-backed bond for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 was based on discounted values of contractual cash flows at a
market discount rate. The mortgage-backed bond was repaid in full during the year ended December
31, 2010.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the fair value of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s junior subordinated debentures,
BankAtlantic Bancorp used NASDAQ price quotes available with respect to its $67.5&nbsp;million of
publicly traded trust preferred securities related to its junior subordinated debentures (&#147;public
debentures&#148;). However, $254.9&nbsp;million of the outstanding trust preferred securities related to its
junior subordinated debentures are not traded, but are privately held in pools (&#147;private
debentures&#148;) and with no liquidity or readily determinable source for valuation. BankAtlantic
Bancorp has deferred the payment of interest with respect to all of its junior subordinated
debentures as permitted by the terms of these securities. Based on the deferral status and the lack
of liquidity and ability of a holder to actively sell such private debentures, the fair value of
these private debentures may be subject to a greater discount to par and have a lower fair value
than indicated by the public debenture price quotes. However, due to their private nature and the
lack of a trading market, fair value of the private debentures was not readily determinable at
December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, and as a practical alternative, BankAtlantic Bancorp used the NASDAQ
price quotes of the public debentures to value its remaining outstanding junior subordinated
debentures whether privately held or publicly traded.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated fair value of Woodbridge&#146;s and Bluegreen&#146;s junior subordinated debentures as of
December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 were based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows at a market
discount rate or market price quotes from the over-the-counter bond market.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carrying amount and fair values of BankAtlantic&#146;s commitments to extend credit, standby

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vacation ownership and real estate industries are subject to extensive and complex
federal, state, and local governmental regulation. Bluegreen is subject to various federal, state,
local and foreign environmental, zoning, consumer protection and other statutes and regulations
regarding the acquisition, subdivision, marketing and sale of real estate and VOIs and various
aspects of its financing operations. On a federal level, the Federal Trade Commission has taken an
active regulatory role through the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or
deceptive acts or unfair competition in interstate commerce. In addition, many states have what
are known as &#147;Little FTC Acts&#148; that apply to intrastate activity. In addition to the laws
applicable to its customer financing and other operations discussed below, Bluegreen is or may be
subject to the Fair Housing Act and various other federal statutes and regulations. Bluegreen is
also subject to various foreign laws with respect to La Cabana Beach and Racquet Club in
Oranjestad, Aruba. In addition, there can be no assurance that in the future, VOIs will not be
deemed to be securities subject to regulation as such, which could have a material adverse effect
on Bluegreen. There is no assurance that the cost of complying with applicable laws and
regulations will not be significant or that we will maintain compliance at all times with all
applicable laws, including those discussed below. Any failure to comply with current or future
applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen&#146;s customer financing activities are also subject to extensive regulation, which can
include, but are not limited to: the Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation&nbsp;Z; the Fair Housing Act;
the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation&nbsp;B; the
Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation&nbsp;E; the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation&nbsp;C;
Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices and Regulation&nbsp;AA; the Patriot Act; the Right to Financial
Privacy Act; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act; and
anti-money laundering laws, among others.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a public company, Bluegreen is subject to reporting and other requirements of the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC and BankAtlantic Bancorp are unitary savings bank holding companies subject to regulatory
oversight. This oversight includes examination and supervision by, and reporting requirements to,
the OTS. BFC and BankAtlantic Bancorp are  also subject to the reporting and other requirements of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into
law permanently raising the maximum standard deposit insurance to $250,000 per depositor, for each
ownership category as defined by the FDIC. The Act also provides for full deposit insurance
coverage on non-interest bearing deposit accounts until December&nbsp;31, 2012.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability of BankAtlantic to pay dividends or make other distributions to BankAtlantic
Bancorp in subsequent periods is subject to regulations and OTS approval and is based upon
BankAtlantic&#146;s regulatory capital levels and net income. Under the terms of the Order entered into
by BankAtlantic with the OTS during the first quarter of 2011 (&#147;the Bank Order&#148;), BankAtlantic is
prohibited from paying dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp without the prior written non-objection of
the OTS. The OTS would not approve any distribution that would cause BankAtlantic to fail to meet
its capital requirements or if the OTS believes that a capital distribution by BankAtlantic
constitutes an unsafe or unsound action or practice, and there is no assurance that the OTS will
approve future capital distributions from BankAtlantic. Accordingly, BankAtlantic Bancorp does not
expect to receive cash dividends from BankAtlantic in the foreseeable future. However,
BankAtlantic Bancorp may receive dividends from its asset work-out subsidiary upon the monetizing
of the subsidiaries&#146; non-performing loans. There is no assurance that BankAtlantic Bancorp will be
able to monetize the loans on acceptable terms, if at all. During the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2008, BankAtlantic paid $15&nbsp;million of dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp. BankAtlantic did not pay
dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC did not receive dividends from BankAtlantic Bancorp during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2010. Under the terms of the Order entered into by BankAtlantic Bancorp with the OTS during the first
quarter of 2011, BankAtlantic Bancorp is restricted from paying dividends on its common stock
without the prior written non-objection of the OTS. In</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">addition, during February&nbsp;2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp elected to exercise its right to defer
payments of interest on its trust preferred junior subordinated debt. BankAtlantic Bancorp is
permitted to defer quarterly interest payments for up to 20 consecutive quarters. During the
deferral period, BankAtlantic Bancorp is prohibited from paying dividends to its shareholders,
including BFC. While BankAtlantic Bancorp can end the deferral period at any time, BankAtlantic
Bancorp has indicated that it anticipates that is may continue to defer such interest payments for
the foreseeable future.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC, on a parent company only basis, has committed that it will not, without the prior
written non-objection of the OTS declare or pay any dividends or other capital distributions other
than dividends payable on BFC&#146;s currently outstanding preferred stock of approximately $187,500 a
quarter, as discussed further in Note 30. The Company has never paid cash dividends to its common
shareholders.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the terms of the Bank Order, BankAtlantic is required to attain by June&nbsp;30, 2011
and maintain a tier 1 (core)&nbsp;capital ratio equal to or greater than 8% and a total risk-based
capital ratio equal to or greater than 14%. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, BankAtlantic had a tier 1 (core)
capital ratio of 6.22% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 11.72%. During the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company contributed $28&nbsp;million and $105
million, respectively, of capital to BankAtlantic. BankAtlantic may not meet the required
regulatory capital ratios in the timeframe set forth by the Bank Order or at all.</DIV>

Woodbridge became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC. For additional information see Note 3.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, BFC received dividends from BankAtlantic

operating activities in the Parent Company Condensed Statements of Cash Flow. BankAtlantic Bancorp
did not pay dividends to BFC during 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, securities available for sale included approximately $17.6

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2008, BFC Parent Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of

litigation that arose in connection with exchange transactions that BFC entered into in 1989 and
1991. BFC is required to repay this obligation as settlement holders submit their claims to BFC.
During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company paid claims of approximately
$24,600, $59,000 and $10,300, respectively, related to this obligation.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Florida law, holders of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock who did not vote to approve
our merger with Woodbridge  and who properly asserted and exercised their appraisal rights with respect
to their shares (&#147;Dissenting Holders&#148;) are entitled to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to
the fair value of their shares (as determined in accordance with the provisions of Florida law) in
lieu of the shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock which they would otherwise have been entitled to
receive. Dissenting Holders, who owned in the aggregate approximately 4.6&nbsp;million shares of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, provided written notice to Woodbridge regarding their intent to
exercise their appraisal rights. In accordance with Florida law, Woodbridge provided written
notices and required forms to the Dissenting Holders setting forth, among other things, its
determination that the fair value of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock immediately prior to the
effectiveness of the merger was $1.10 per share. Dissenting Holders were required to return their
appraisal forms by November&nbsp;10, 2009 and indicate on their appraisal forms whether the Dissenting
Holder chose to (i)&nbsp;accept Woodbridge&#146;s offer of $1.10 per share or (ii)&nbsp;demand payment of the fair
value estimate determined by the Dissenting Holder plus interest. One Dissenting Holder which held
approximately 400,000 shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock has withdrawn its shares from the
appraisal rights process, while the remaining Dissenting Holders, who collectively held
approximately 4.2&nbsp;million shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, have rejected Woodbridge&#146;s
offer of $1.10 per share and requested payment for their shares based on their respective fair
value estimates of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. In December&nbsp;2009, the Company recorded a $4.6
million liability with a corresponding reduction to additional paid-in capital representing, in the
aggregate, Woodbridge&#146;s offer to the Dissenting Holders.  The appraisal rights litigation thereafter commenced and
is currently ongoing. The outcome of the letigation is uncertain and  there is no assurance as to the
amount of cash that  will be required to be paid to the Dissenting Holders, which amount may be
greater than the $4.6&nbsp;million that we have accrued.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During November&nbsp;2009, AmTrust Bank filed a two count complaint against Woodbridge and Carolina
Oak, alleging default under a promissory note and breach of a guaranty related to an approximately
$37.2&nbsp;million loan that is collateralized by property owned by Carolina Oak. During December&nbsp;2009,
the OTS closed AmTrust and appointed the FDIC as receiver. On March&nbsp;3, 2010, the FDIC filed a
motion to substitute as the real party in interest and filed a notice of removal. The FDIC
subsequently sold the loan to an investor group. While there may have been an issue with respect to
compliance with certain covenants in the loan documents, we do not believe that an event of default
occurred. Through participation in a court-ordered mediation of this matter, the parties agreed to
tentative terms to settle the matter and are currently negotiating a formal settlement agreement.
It is currently expected that this settlement agreement, if finalized, will provide for (i)
Woodbridge to pay $2.5&nbsp;million to the investor group, (ii)&nbsp;Carolina Oak to convey to the investor
group the real property securing the loan via a stipulated foreclosure or deed in lieu, (iii)&nbsp;the
investor group to release Woodbridge and Carolina Oak from their obligations relating to the debt
or, alternatively, to agree not to pursue certain remedies, including a deficiency judgment, that
would otherwise be available to them, in each case subject to certain conditions, and (iv)&nbsp;the
litigation to be dismissed. There is no assurance that the settlement will be finalized on the
contemplated terms, or at all.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This litigation arose from a dispute regarding liability under two performance bonds for
infrastructure issued in connection with a plat issued by the City of Brooksville for a single
family housing project that was not commenced. The project had been abandoned by Levitt and Sons
prior to its bankruptcy filing as non-viable as a consequence of the economic downturn and, in
connection with the Levitt and Sons bankruptcy, the mortgagee, Key Bank, was permitted by agreement
to initiate and conclude a foreclosure leading to the acquisition of the property by Key Bank&#146;s
subsidiary. The City of Brooksville contended that, notwithstanding that the development had not
proceeded and was not likely to proceed at any known time in the future, it was entitled to recover
the face amount of the bonds in the approximate amount of $5.4&nbsp;million. Woodbridge filed a suit
for declaratory judgment (in the name of its surety, Westchester) against the City of Brooksville
contending that the obligation under the bonds had terminated. In August&nbsp;2010, Woodbridge was
granted a motion for summary judgment. Subsequent to the motion being granted, the municipality
appealed the decision.

impose such a tax is contrary to Tennessee law and have vigorously opposed, and intend to continue

2007 to discuss this matter with representatives of the Division. No formal resolution of the issue
was reached during the conference and no further action has to date been initiated by the State of

Laird and MSB of Destin, Inc. as seller, were entitled to the $1.4&nbsp;million escrow deposit being
maintained with the escrow agent pursuant to a purchase and sale contract for real property located
in Destin, Florida. Both Bluegreen and the seller brought cross-claims for breach of the
underlying purchase and sale contract. The seller&#146;s complaint, as amended, includes a fraud
allegation, contends that Bluegreen failed to perform under the terms of the purchase and sale
contract and claims entitlement to the full amount in escrow. Bluegreen maintains that its
decision not to close on the purchase of the property was proper under the terms of the purchase
and sale contract and therefore are entitled to a return of the full escrow deposit. A trial date
of May&nbsp;31, 2011 has been set for this matter. Bluegreen believes the seller&#146;s allegations are

Lesley et a1. v. Bluff Dale Development Corporation, Bluegreen Southwest One. L.P. et al.,</U> in
the 266th Judicial District Court, Erath County, Texas, the plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment
action against Southwest seeking to develop their reserved mineral interests in, on and under the
Mountain Lakes subdivision. The plaintiffs&#146; claims are based on property law, oil and gas law,
contract and tort theories. The property owners association and some of the individual landowners
have filed cross actions against Bluegreen, Southwest and individual directors of the property
owners association related to the mineral rights and certain amenities in the subdivision as
described below. On January&nbsp;17, 2007, the court ruled that the restrictions placed on the
development that prohibited oil and gas production and development were invalid and not enforceable
as a matter of law, that such restrictions did not prohibit the development of the plaintiffs&#146;
prior reserved mineral interests and that Southwest breached its duty to lease the minerals to
third parties for development. The court further ruled that Southwest was the sole holder of the
right to lease the minerals to third parties. The order granting the plaintiffs&#146; motion was

Appeals, Eastland, Texas, the Appellate Court reversed the trial court&#146;s decision and ruled in
Southwest&#146;s favor and determined that all executive rights were owned by Southwest and then
transferred to the individual property owners in connection with the sales of land. All property
owner claims were decided in favor of Southwest. It was also decided that Southwest did not breach
a fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs as an executive rights holder. On May&nbsp;14, 2009, the plaintiffs
filed an appeal with the Texas Supreme Court asking the Court to reverse the Appellate Court&#146;s
decision in favor of Southwest. On September&nbsp;15, 2010 the Court heard oral arguments on whether to
reverse or affirm the Appellate Court&#146;s decision. No information is available as to when the Texas

    <TD>As part of the shared service arrangement, BFC pays BankAtlantic
and Bluegreen for the cost of office facilities utilized by BFC

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had cash and cash equivalents accounts at
BankAtlantic with balances of approximately $1.8&nbsp;million and $20.9&nbsp;million, respectively. These
accounts were on the same general terms as deposits made by unaffiliated third parties.
Additionally, during 2009, the Company invested funds through the Certificate of Deposit Account
Registry Service (&#147;CDARS&#148;) program at BankAtlantic, which facilitates the placement of funds into
certificates of deposits issued by other financial institutions in increments of less than the
standard FDIC insurance maximum to insure that both principal and interest are eligible for full
FDIC insurance coverage. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company had $7.7&nbsp;million invested through the
CDARS program at BankAtlantic. The Company did not have any funds invested through the CDARS
program at BankAtlantic at December&nbsp;31, 2010. The aggregate interest income recognized by the
Company in connection with these funds held at BankAtlantic was approximately $1,000, $39,000 and
$80,000 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2010, BankAtlantic Bancorp and BankAtlantic entered into a real estate advisory
service agreement with BFC for assistance relating to the work-out of loans and the sale of real
estate owned. Under the terms of the agreement, BFC receives a monthly fee of $12,500 from each of
BankAtlantic and BankAtlantic Bancorp and, if BFC&#146;s efforts result in net recoveries of any
non-performing loan or the sale of real estate owned, BFC will receive a fee equal to 1% of the net
value recovered. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, BFC was paid an aggregate of
approximately $787,000 of real estate advisory service fees under this agreement.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;28, 2010, BFC loaned approximately $8.0&nbsp;million to BankAtlantic Bancorp, and
BankAtlantic Bancorp executed a promissory note in favor of BFC with a maturity date of July&nbsp;30,
2010. The note provided for payment either in cash or shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock, depending on the results of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s rights offering and the number of
shares allocable to BFC pursuant to its exercise of subscription rights in the rights offering. In
July&nbsp;2010, BankAtlantic Bancorp satisfied the promissory note in full through the issuance of
5,302,816 shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock to BFC. These shares were in
addition to the 4,697,184 shares previously issued to BFC in the
rights offering.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company leases office space to Pizza Fusion for approximately $68,000 annually pursuant to
a month-to-month lease which commenced in September&nbsp;2008. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010,
2009 and 2008, Pizza Fusion paid approximately $48,000, $68,000 and $20,000, respectively, under
the lease agreement.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, Bluegreen reimbursed the Company and
Woodbridge approximately $1.4&nbsp;million and $2.4&nbsp;million, respectively, for certain expenses incurred
in assisting Bluegreen in its efforts to explore potential additional sources of liquidity.
Additionally, during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, Bluegreen paid Snapper Creek, a
subsidiary of BFC, approximately $1.3&nbsp;million and $500,000, respectively, for a variety of
management advisory services.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in 2009, Bluegreen entered into a land lease with Benihana, who
constructed and operates one of its restaurants on Bluegreen&#146;s
land parcel. During each of 2010 and 2009
Bluegreen received lease payments from Benihana of approximately
$0.1&nbsp;million.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During December&nbsp;2009, Snapper Creek was engaged by Benihana to provide certain management,
financial advisory and other consulting services. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, the
consulting fees payable to Snapper Creek under this arrangement were approximately $650,000. The
engagement ceased during November&nbsp;2010. During 2010, Benihana engaged Risk Management Services (&#147;RMS&#148;), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC, to provide insurance and risk management services. For the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, RMS received approximately $45,000 under this arrangement. The engagement
ceased during January&nbsp;2011.</DIV>

in accordance with the terms of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s stock option plans, not to cancel the stock
options held by those former employees. There were no options exercised by former BankAtlantic
Bancorp employees during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 or 2008. BankAtlantic Bancorp from
time to time also issues options and restricted stock awards to BFC employees that perform services

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) to make known material information concerning the Company, including its
subsidiaries, to those officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of our
senior management. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, our management evaluated, with the participation of
our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, our disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial
Officer and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that, as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief
Accounting Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all improper conduct. A control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must
be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
improper conduct, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
Further, the design of any control system is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules&nbsp;13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Internal
control over financial reporting includes controls over the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with the instruction to the consolidated financial statements for savings and loan
holding companies (OTS Form&nbsp;H-(b) 11) to comply with the reporting requirements of Section&nbsp;112 of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. Our internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As of December&nbsp;31,
2010, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial
Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in <I>Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on such
evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered certified public accounting firm, has
audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2010
as stated in its report which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Item&nbsp;8 &#147;Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.&#148;
