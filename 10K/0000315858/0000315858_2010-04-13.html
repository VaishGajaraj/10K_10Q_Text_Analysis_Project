<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the risks and factors identified above and in PART I, Item&nbsp;1A of this report,
reference is also made to other risks and factors detailed in reports filed by the Company,
BankAtlantic Bancorp and Bluegreen with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;). The
Company cautions that the foregoing factors are not exclusive.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>The Company</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a diversified holding company whose principal holdings include a controlling interest
in BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries (&#147;BankAtlantic Bancorp&#148;), a controlling interest
in Bluegreen Corporation and its subsidiaries (&#147;Bluegreen&#148;), a non-controlling interest in
Benihana, Inc. (&#147;Benihana&#148;) and an indirect interest in Core Communities, LLC (&#147;Core&#148; or &#147;Core
Communities&#148;). As a result of our position as the controlling shareholder of BankAtlantic
Bancorp, we are a &#147;unitary savings bank holding company&#148; regulated by the Office of Thrift
Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;). As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had total consolidated assets of approximately
$6.0&nbsp;billion and shareholders&#146; equity attributable to BFC of approximately $245.1&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, BFC&#146;s business strategy has been to invest in and acquire businesses in diverse
industries either directly or through controlled subsidiaries. BFC believes that in the short term
that the Company&#146;s and shareholders&#146; interests are best served by providing strategic support for
its existing investments. In furtherance of this strategy, the Company took several steps in 2009
which it believes will enhance the Company&#146;s prospects. Key actions taken in 2009 included the
merger of BFC with Woodbridge Holdings; the purchase of an additional 7% interest in BankAtlantic
Bancorp, increasing our economic interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp to 37% and increasing our voting
interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp to 66%; and the purchase of an additional 23% interest in
Bluegreen increasing our ownership in Bluegreen to 52%. The acquisition of this control position in
Bluegreen resulted in a bargain purchase gain of approximately $183.1&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter
and net income attributable to BFC of $25.7&nbsp;million for the year. In addition, we took actions to
restructure Core in recognition of the continued depressed real estate market and its inability to
meet its obligations to its lenders. Over the longer term and as the economy improves, we may look
to increase our ownership in our affiliates or seek to make other opportunistic investments, with
no pre-determined parameters as to the industry or structure of the investment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, we consummated our merger with Woodbridge Holdings Corporation pursuant
to which Woodbridge Holdings Corporation merged with and into Woodbridge Holdings, LLC (&#147;Woodbridge&#148;), which
continued as the surviving company of the merger and the successor entity to Woodbridge Holdings
Corporation. Pursuant to the terms of the merger, which was approved by each company&#146;s shareholders
at their respective meetings held on September&nbsp;21, 2009, each outstanding share of Woodbridge&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock automatically converted into the right to receive 3.47 shares of our Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock. Shares otherwise issuable to us attributable to the shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock owned by us were canceled in connection with the merger. As
a result of the merger, Woodbridge Holdings Corporation&#146;s separate corporate existence ceased and
its Class&nbsp;A Common Stock is no longer publicly traded. See Note 3 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements&#148; for additional information about the merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;16, 2009, we purchased approximately 7.4&nbsp;million additional shares of Bluegreen&#146;s
common stock, which increased our ownership in Bluegreen from 9.5&nbsp;million shares, or 29%, to 16.9
million shares, or 52% of Bluegreen&#146;s outstanding stock. As a result of the purchase, we now hold a
controlling interest in Bluegreen and, accordingly, have consolidated Bluegreen&#146;s results since
November&nbsp;16, 2009 into our financial statements. Any references to Bluegreen&#146;s results of
operations includes only 45&nbsp;days of activity for Bluegreen relating to the period from November&nbsp;16,
2009, the date of the share purchase, through December&nbsp;31, 2009 <B>(</B>the &#147;Bluegreen Interim Period&#148;<B>).</B>
Prior to November&nbsp;16, 2009, our approximate 29% equity investment in Bluegreen was accounted for
under the equity method. See Note 4 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; of this
report for additional information about the Bluegreen share acquisition on November&nbsp;16, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a holding company with controlling positions in BankAtlantic Bancorp and Bluegreen,
generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) requires the consolidation of the financial
results of both entities. As a consequence, the assets and liabilities of both entities are
presented on a consolidated basis in BFC&#146;s financial statements. However, except as otherwise
noted, the debts and obligations of the consolidated entities, including Woodbridge, are not direct
obligations of BFC and are non-recourse to BFC. Similarly, the assets of those entities are not
available to BFC absent a dividend or distribution. The recognition by BFC of income from
controlled entities is determined based on the total percent of economic ownership in those
entities. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, BFC owned approximately 37% of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A and
Class&nbsp;B common stock, representing approximately 66% of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s total voting power.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Investment in Benihana</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benihana is a NASDAQ-listed company with two classes of common shares: Common Stock (BNHN)&nbsp;and
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock (BNHNA). We own 800,000 shares of Benihana Series&nbsp;B Convertible Preferred
Stock (&#147;Convertible Preferred Stock&#148;). The Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into an
aggregate of 1,578,943 shares of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock at a conversion price of $12.67 per share
of Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment from time to time upon certain defined
events. Based on the number of currently outstanding shares of Benihana&#146;s capital stock, the
Convertible Preferred Stock, if converted, would represent an approximate 19% voting interest and
an approximate 9% economic interest in Benihana. Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock are
entitled to receive cumulative quarterly dividends at an annual rate equal to $1.25 per share,
payable on the last day of each calendar quarter. The Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to
mandatory redemption of $20&nbsp;million plus accumulated dividends on July&nbsp;2, 2014 unless we elect to
extend the mandatory redemption date to a date no later than July&nbsp;2, 2024. At December&nbsp;31, 2009,
the closing price of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock was $4.20 per share. The market value of the
Convertible Preferred Stock if converted to Benihana&#146;s Common Stock at December&nbsp;31, 2009 would have
been approximately $6.6&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2008, the Company performed an impairment evaluation of its investment in the
Convertible Preferred Stock and determined that there was an other-than-temporary decline of
approximately $3.6&nbsp;million and, accordingly, the investment was written down to its fair value at
that time of approximately $16.4&nbsp;million. Concurrent with management&#146;s evaluation of the
impairment of this investment at December&nbsp;31, 2008, it made the determination to reclassify this
investment from investment securities to investment securities available for sale. At December&nbsp;31,
2009, the Company&#146;s estimated fair value of its investment in Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred
Stock was approximately $17.8&nbsp;million. BFC will continue to monitor this investment to determine
whether any further other-than-temporary impairment charges may be required in future periods. The
estimated fair value of the Company&#146;s investment in Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock was
assessed using the income approach with Level 3 inputs by discounting future cash flows at a market
discount rate combined with the fair value of the underlying shares that BFC would receive upon
conversion of its shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock. See Note 7 of the &#147;Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; in Item&nbsp;8 of this report for further information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Other Operations</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other operations includes the consolidated operations of Pizza Fusion Holdings, LLC (&#147;Pizza
Fusion&#148;) (which is a restaurant franchisor operating within the quick service and organic food
industries), and the activities of Cypress Creek Capital Holdings, LLC (&#147;Cypress Creek Capital&#148;)
and Snapper Creek Equity Management, LLC (&#147;Snapper Creek&#148;) and other investments and joint
ventures. In addition, prior to obtaining a controlling interest in Bluegreen on November&nbsp;16, 2009,
we accounted for our investment in Bluegreen under the equity method of accounting and Bluegreen&#146;s
earnings or loss was included in the BFC Activities segment. Historically, the cost of the
Bluegreen investment was adjusted to recognize our interest in Bluegreen&#146;s earnings or losses. The
difference between a) our ownership percentage in Bluegreen multiplied by its earnings and b) the
amount of our equity in earnings of Bluegreen as reflected in our financial statements related to
the amortization or accretion of purchase accounting adjustments made at the time of the initial
acquisition of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock in 2002 and a basis difference due to impairment charges
recorded on the investment in Bluegreen, as described in Note 14 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our overall strategy to diversify our business, during the third quarter of 2009,
we exercised our option to purchase 521,740 shares of Series&nbsp;B Convertible Preferred Stock of Pizza
Fusion at a price of $1.15 per share or an aggregate purchase price of $600,000, resulting in an
ownership interest of approximately 45% in Pizza Fusion. On January&nbsp;15, 2010 we participated in
Pizza Fusion&#146;s $3&nbsp;million private placement by investing another $400,000. As of March&nbsp;31, 2010,
Pizza Fusion had 18 restaurants, including 2 restaurants owned by Pizza Fusion and 16 franchised
restaurants, operating in nine states and had entered into franchise agreements for an additional
12 stores by September&nbsp;2010. Pizza Fusion is in its early stages and it will likely require
additional financial support. Pizza Fusion is facing several challenges, including the effect of
the current economic downturn on consumer spending patterns. In addition, adding to the adverse
impact of the economy on the restaurant industry, the tightening of the credit markets has made it
difficult for new franchisees to obtain financing. During 2009, the Company performed its annual
review of goodwill for impairment and determined that the discounted value of estimated cash flows
was below the carrying value of Pizza Fusion, resulting in a write-off of the entire $2.0&nbsp;million
of goodwill relating to the investment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Real Estate Operations</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Real Estate Operations segment is comprised of the subsidiaries through which Woodbridge
historically conducted its real estate business activities. It includes the operations of Core,
Carolina Oak ,which engaged in homebuilding activities in South Carolina prior to the suspension of
those activities in the fourth quarter of 2008, and Cypress Creek Holdings, LLC (&#147;Cypress Creek
Holdings&#148;), which engages in leasing activities. These activities are concentrated primarily in
Florida and South Carolina and have included the development and sale of land, the construction and
sale of single family homes and town homes and the leasing of commercial properties and office
space.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levitt and Sons was included in the Real Estate Operations segment until November&nbsp;9, 2007 at
which time it filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition and was deconsolidated from our audited
consolidated financial statements. Levitt Commercial was also included in this segment until it
ceased development activities after it sold all of its remaining units in 2007. Levitt Commercial
which is also included in this segment disposed of its last asset in 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Core Communities</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core Communities was founded in May&nbsp;1996 to develop a master&#151;planned community in Port St.
Lucie, Florida now known as St. Lucie West. Historically, its activities focused on the development
of a master-planned community in Port St. Lucie, Florida called Tradition, Florida and a community
outside of Hardeeville, South Carolina called Tradition Hilton Head. Until 2009, Tradition,
Florida was in active development as was Tradition Hilton Head, although in a much earlier stage.
As a master-planned community developer, Core Communities historically was engaged in four primary
activities: (i)&nbsp;the acquisition of large tracts of raw land; (ii)&nbsp;planning, entitlement and
infrastructure development; (iii)&nbsp;the sale of entitled land and/or developed lots to homebuilders
and commercial, industrial and institutional end-users; and (iv)&nbsp;the development and leasing of
income producing commercial real estate to commercial, industrial and institutional end-users.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2009, the recession continued and the demand for residential and commercial inventory
showed no signs of recovery, particularly in the geographic regions where Core&#146;s properties are
located. The decrease in land sales in 2009 and continued cash flow deficits contributed to,
among other things, the deterioration of Core&#146;s liquidity. As a result, Core has severely limited
its development expenditures in Tradition, Florida and has completely discontinued development
activity in Tradition Hilton Head. Its assets have been impaired significantly and in an effort to
bring about an orderly liquidation without a bankruptcy filing, Core commenced negotiations with
all of its lenders to restructure its outstanding debt in light of its cash position. Core is
currently in default under the terms of all of its outstanding debt and Core continues to pursue
all options with its lenders, including offering deeds in lieu and other similar transactions
wherein Core would relinquish title to substantially all of its assets. As of February&nbsp;5, 2010,
with Core&#146;s concurrence, a significant portion of the land in Tradition Hilton Head had been placed
under the control of a court appointed receiver. There is no assurance that Core will be
successful in restructuring its debts or achieving an orderly liquidation of its assets. In
consideration of the foregoing, we evaluated Core&#146;s real estate inventory for impairment on a
project-by-project basis. As a result of the impairment analyses performed, we recorded impairment
charges of $63.3&nbsp;million related to Core&#146;s real estate inventory to reduce the carrying amount of
Core&#146;s real estate inventory to its fair value at December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2009, Core reinitiated efforts to sell two of its commercial leasing projects (the
&#147;Projects&#148;) and began soliciting bids from several potential buyers to purchase assets associated
with the Projects. The assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition and Core
determined that it is probable that it will sell the Projects in 2010. Due to this decision, the
assets associated with the Projects that are for sale have been classified as discontinued
operations for all periods presented in accordance with the accounting guidance for the disposal of
long-lived assets. Core has accepted an offer to sell the Projects, which has been approved by the
lender with substantially all of the proceeds going to satisfy its obligations to the lender.
However, there can be no assurance that the transaction will close or that the lender will release
Core from its obligations. See Note 22 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for
further information.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2007, Woodbridge acquired from Levitt and Sons all of the outstanding membership interests
in Carolina Oak, a South Carolina limited liability company (formerly known as Levitt and Sons of
Jasper County, LLC). The development activities at Carolina Oak, which is within Tradition Hilton
Head, were suspended in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of, among other things, a
deterioration in consumer confidence, overall softening of demand for new homes, a decline in the
overall economy, increasing unemployment, a deterioration in the credit markets, and the direct and
indirect impact of the turmoil in the mortgage loan market. In 2009, the housing industry continued
to face significant challenges and Woodbridge made the decision to cease all activities at Carolina
Oak. Furthermore, the lender declared a default of the $37.2&nbsp;million loan that is collateralized by
the Carolina Oak property. Subsequently, the lender was taken over by the FDIC and accordingly, the
FDIC now holds the loan. While there may be issues with respect to compliance with certain loan
covenants, we do not believe that an event of default occurred. Woodbridge is negotiating with
representatives of the FDIC in an effort to bring about a satisfactory resolution with regard to
the debt; however, the outcome of the negotiations is currently uncertain.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, we reviewed inventory of real estate at Carolina Oak for
impairment in accordance with the accounting guidance for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
assets. As a result of the analysis, we recorded impairment charges of $16.7&nbsp;million and $3.5
million in cost of sales for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which are
reflected in the Real Estate Operations segment. See Note 12 of the &#147;Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements&#148; for further information.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2005, Cypress Creek Holdings has owned an 80,000 square foot office building in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida. The building was previously 50% occupied by an unaffiliated third party
pursuant to a lease which expired in March&nbsp;2010. The tenant opted not to renew the lease and
vacated the space as of March&nbsp;31, 2010. We intend to seek to sell the building or lease the vacant
space in the building to third parties, including our affiliates, in 2010. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009,
we evaluated the value of the office building for impairment in accordance with the accounting
guidance for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and determined that the carrying value
exceeded the fair value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $4.3&nbsp;million in our
statement of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009.

formed in 2001 to develop industrial, commercial, retail and residential properties. In 2007,
Levitt Commercial ceased development activities after it sold all of its remaining units. Levitt
Commercial&#146;s revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 amounted to $6.6&nbsp;million which reflected
the delivery of the 17 flex warehouse units at its remaining development project.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Levitt and Sons</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquired in December&nbsp;1999, Levitt and Sons was a developer of single family homes and town
home communities for active adults and families in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.
Increased inventory levels combined with weakened consumer demand for housing and tightened credit
requirements negatively affected sales, deliveries and margins throughout the homebuilding
industry. Levitt and Sons experienced decreased orders, decreased margins and increased
cancellation rates on homes in backlog. Excess supply, particularly in previously strong markets
like Florida, in combination with a reduction in demand resulting from tightened credit
requirements and reductions in credit availability, as well as buyers&#146; fears about the direction of

subsidiaries (collectively, the &#147;Debtors&#148;) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter&nbsp;11 of
Title 11 of the United States Code (the &#147;Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases&#148;) in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the Southern District of Florida (the &#147;Bankruptcy Court&#148;).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the filing of the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases, we deconsolidated Levitt and Sons as of
November&nbsp;9, 2007, eliminating all future operations from our financial results of operations. As a
result of the deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons, we recorded our interest in Levitt and Sons under
the cost method of accounting. Under cost method accounting, income is recognized only to the
extent of cash received or upon the release of Levitt and Sons from its bankruptcy obligations
through the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, at which time any recorded loss in excess of the
investment in Levitt and Sons is recognized into income. As of November&nbsp;9, 2007, Woodbridge had a
negative investment in Levitt and Sons of $123.0&nbsp;million and outstanding advances of $67.8&nbsp;million
due to Woodbridge resulting in a net negative investment of $55.2&nbsp;million. Included in the
negative investment was approximately $15.8&nbsp;million associated with deferred revenue related to
intra-segment sales between Levitt and Sons and Core Communities. During the fourth quarter of
2008, we identified approximately $2.3&nbsp;million of deferred revenue on intercompany sales between
Core and Carolina Oak that had been misclassified against the negative investment in Levitt and
Sons. As a result, we recorded a $2.3&nbsp;million reclassification between inventory of real estate and
the loss in excess of investment in subsidiary in the consolidated statements of financial
condition. Accordingly, as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, our net negative investment was $52.9&nbsp;million.
During the pendency of the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases, we also incurred certain administrative costs in the
amount of $1.6&nbsp;million and $748,000 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, respectively,
relating to certain services and benefits provided by us in favor of the Debtors. These costs
included the cost of maintaining employee benefit plans, providing accounting services, human
resources expenses, general liability and property insurance premiums, payroll processing expenses,
licensing and third-party professional fees (collectively, the &#147;Post Petition Services&#148;). These
costs were not significant in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously reported, on February&nbsp;20, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order
confirming a plan of liquidation jointly proposed by Levitt and Sons and the Official Committee of
Unsecured Creditors. That order also approved the settlement pursuant to the settlement agreement
that was entered into on June&nbsp;27, 2008, as amended. No appeal or rehearing of the Bankruptcy
Court&#146;s order was filed by any party, and the settlement was consummated on March&nbsp;3, 2009, at
which time, payment was made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the settlement
agreement. Under cost method accounting, the cost of settlement and the related $52.9&nbsp;million
liability (less $500,000 which was determined as the settlement holdback and remained as an
accrual pursuant to the settlement agreement), was recognized into income in the first quarter of
2009, resulting in a $40.4&nbsp;million gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary. In the fourth
quarter of 2009, we accrued approximately $10.7&nbsp;million in connection with a portion of a tax
refund of which the Levitt and Sons estate is entitled to pursuant to the Settlement Agreement
entered into with the Joint Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases and, as a
result, the gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009
was $29.7&nbsp;million. See Note 25 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for more
information regarding the tax refund.

common stock, which increased our ownership in Bluegreen from 9.5&nbsp;million shares, or 29%, to 16.9

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen is a leading provider of &#147;Colorful Places to Live and Play&#153;&#148; through two divisions:
Bluegreen Resorts and Bluegreen Communities. For the Bluegreen Interim Period, Bluegreen
Resorts sales represented 83% of Bluegreen&#146;s sales of real estate and Bluegreen Communities
represented 17% of its sales of real estate. Bluegreen Resorts markets, sells and manages real
estate-based vacation ownership interests (&#147;VOIs&#148;) in resorts generally located in popular,
high-volume, &#147;drive-to&#148; vacation destinations, which were developed or acquired by Bluegreen or
developed by others. Bluegreen also earns fees from third parties for providing sales, marketing,
mortgage servicing, construction management, title, and resort management services to third party
resort developers and owners. Bluegreen Communities acquires, develops and subdivides property and
markets residential land home sites. The majority of these home sites are sold directly to retail
customers who seek to build a home, in some cases on properties featuring a golf course and related
amenities. Bluegreen Communities recently began offering real estate consulting and other services
to third parties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Bluegreen Resorts</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen Resorts has been involved in the vacation ownership industry since its inception in
1994. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, Bluegreen managed approximately 222,600 VOI owners, including
approximately 168,500 members in the Bluegreen Vacation Club, and it sells VOIs in the Bluegreen
Vacation Club at 21 sales offices located at resorts located in the United States and Aruba. A
deeded real estate interest in a Bluegreen Vacation Club VOI in any of Bluegreen resorts entitles
the buyer to an annual or biennial allotment of &#147;points&#148; in perpetuity. Club members may use their
points to stay in one of 27 Bluegreen Vacation Club &#151; Club Resorts and 27 other Club Associated
resorts as well as for other vacation options, including cruises and stays at over 4,000 resorts
offered through Resort Condominiums International, LLC (&#147;RCI&#148;), an external exchange network. Club
members who acquired or upgraded their VOIs on or after November&nbsp;1, 2007 also have access to 21
Shell Vacation Club (&#147;Shell&#148;) resorts, through Bluegreen&#146;s Select Connections&#153; joint venture with
Shell. Shell is an unaffiliated privately-held resort developer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Bluegreen&#146;s inception, it has generated approximately 328,000 VOI sales transactions,
which include 2,593 VOI sales transactions on behalf of third party developers. Bluegreen Resorts&#146;
estimated remaining life-of-project sales at December&nbsp;31, 2009, were approximately $3.3&nbsp;billion,
which included $1.0&nbsp;billion of completed inventory. For the Bluegreen Interim Period, Bluegreen Resorts recognized Sales and Segment Operating Profit of $15.3&nbsp;million
and $3.2&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen Resorts uses a variety of methods to attract prospective purchasers of VOIs,
including marketing of mini-vacations either through face-to-face contact at kiosks in retail and
leisure locations or through telemarketing campaigns and marketing to current owners of VOIs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen&#146;s Bluegreen Vacation Club system permits its VOI owners to purchase a real estate
timeshare interest which provides owners with an annual or biennial allotment of points, which can
be redeemed for occupancy rights at Bluegreen Vacation Club and Club Associate resorts. Bluegreen
believes the Bluegreen Vacation Club allows its VOI owners to customize their vacation experience
in a more flexible manner than traditional fixed-week vacation ownership programs. Bluegreen also
offers a Sampler program. The Sampler program allows package purchasers to enjoy substantially the
same amenities, activities and services offered to Bluegreen Vacation Club members during a
one-year trial period. Bluegreen believes that it benefits from the Sampler program as it gives
them an opportunity to market their VOIs to customers when they use their trial
memberships at Bluegreen resorts and to recapture some of the costs incurred in connection
with the initial marketing to prospective customers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen&#146;s emphasis on cash resulted in Bluegreen providing financing to approximately 68%
of its vacation ownership customers in 2009. Customers are required to make a down payment of at
least 10% of the VOI sales price and typically finance the balance of the sales price over a period
of ten years. In 2009, Bluegreen began incentivizing its sales associates to encourage higher cash
down payments, and Bluegreen has increased both the percentage of its sales that are 100% cash and
its average down payment on financed sales. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, Bluegreen serviced $795.9
million of VOI receivables and its on-balance sheet vacation ownership receivables portfolio
totaled approximately $348.7&nbsp;million in principal amount. See &#147;Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet
Adopted&#148; for further discussion. Historically Bluegreen has maintained vacation ownership
receivables warehouse facilities and separate vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities to
maintain liquidity associated with its vacation ownership receivables; however, the term
securitization market had experienced significantly reduced activity and transactions that were
consummated were on significantly more adverse terms. As a result of this and other factors,
financial institutions are reluctant to enter into new credit facilities for the purpose of
providing financing on consumer receivables. Several lenders to the timeshare industry, including
certain of Bluegreen&#146;s lenders, have announced that they either have or will be exiting the resort
finance business or will not be entering into new financing commitments for the foreseeable future.
In addition, the availability of financing for real estate acquisition and development and the
capital markets for corporate debt have likewise been adversely impacted. See &#147;Liquidity and
Capital Resources&#148; for a further discussion of Bluegreen&#146;s vacation ownership receivables
facilities and certain risks relating to such facilities.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen Communities focuses on developing and subdividing property and marketing residential
home sites. The majority of sites are sold directly to retail customers who seek to build a home
generally in the future (in some cases on properties featuring a golf course and other related
amenities). Bluegreen Communities has historically sought to acquire and develop land near major
metropolitan centers, but outside the perimeter of intense subdivision development, and in popular
retirement areas. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in response to the challenging
economic environment, Bluegreen began to sell home sites in only completed sections of its
communities and significantly reduced its overall spending on development activities. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2009, Bluegreen Communities was actively engaged in marketing and selling home sites
directly to retail consumers in communities primarily located in Texas, Georgia, and North
Carolina. Bluegreen Communities had approximately $100.9&nbsp;million of inventory at carrying value as
of December&nbsp;31, 2009. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, Bluegreen Communities recognized sales
of $3.1&nbsp;million and Segment Operating Loss of $3.3&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically Bluegreen has marketed its communities through a combination of newspaper, direct
mail, television, billboard, internet and radio advertising. Bluegreen Communities also
historically utilized a customer relationship management computer software system to assist it in
compiling, processing, and maintaining information concerning future sales prospects. During 2009,
its marketing of communities shifted to focus on internet advertising, consumer and broker outreach
programs and billboards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen Communities also currently owns and operates two daily fee golf courses which it
believes will increase the marketability of adjacent home sites and communities.

seven-day banking in Florida. This banking initiative has contributed to a significant increase in
core deposits (demand deposit accounts, NOW checking accounts and savings accounts). BankAtlantic&#146;s
core deposits increased from approximately $600&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2001 to $2.6&nbsp;billion as

management strategy in 2008 and our relationship marketing strategy in 2009
have enhanced our visibility in our market, increased customer loyalty and contributed
significantly to the increase in core deposit balances.

Capital Requirements&#148; for an explanation of capital standards. Management has implemented
initiatives with a view toward maintaining adequate capital in response to the current adverse
economic environment. These initiatives primarily include the reduction of risk-based asset levels
through loan and securities repayments in the ordinary course, eliminating cash dividends to
BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company, and reducing expenses. These initiatives, while important to
maintaining capital ratios, have also negatively impacted operations as the reduction in asset
levels resulted in the reduction in earning assets adversely impacting our net interest income.
Another source of regulatory capital for BankAtlantic was capital contributions from BankAtlantic
Bancorp. During 2009 and 2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp contributed $105&nbsp;million and $65&nbsp;million,
respectively, of capital to BankAtlantic. The $105&nbsp;million capital contribution during 2009 was

$137.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008 to $187.2&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009 reflecting the continued
deterioration of economic conditions in our markets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also continued our initiatives to decrease operating expenses during 2009. These
initiatives included lowering advertising and marketing expenditures, maintaining reduced store and
call center hours and reducing back-office operations, and staffing levels, and renegotiating
vendor contracts. During 2010, management intends to seek further efficiencies and to maintain
its decreased expense organizational structure. BankAtlantic is also continuing to evaluate its
products and services as well as its delivery systems and back-office support infrastructure with a
view toward enhancing its operational efficiency.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of BankAtlantic&#146;s efforts to diversify its loan portfolio, during 2009, BankAtlantic
focused on originating small business and middle market commercial loans through its retail and
lending networks. BankAtlantic anticipates a continued emphasis on small business and middle
market lending and expects the percentage represented by its commercial real estate and
residential mortgage loan portfolio balances to decline during 2010 through the scheduled repayment
of existing loans and significant reductions in commercial real estate loan originations and
residential loan purchases.

</DIV>


<DIV align="right" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">&nbsp;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Residential: </I>Historically, BankAtlantic has purchased residential loans in the secondary
markets that have been originated by other institutions. These loans, which are serviced by
independent servicers, are secured by properties located throughout the United States. Residential
loans are typically purchased in bulk and are generally non-conforming loans under agency
guidelines due to the size of the individual loans (&#147;jumbo loans&#148;). BankAtlantic set general
guidelines for loan purchases relating to loan amount, type of property, state of residence,
loan-to-value ratios, the borrower&#146;s sources of funds, appraised amounts and loan documentation,
but actual purchases will generally reflect availability and market conditions, and may vary from
BankAtlantic&#146;s general guidelines. Included in these purchased residential loans are interest-only
loans. These loans result in possible future increases in a borrower&#146;s loan payments when the
contractually required repayments increase due to interest rate adjustments and when required
amortization of the principal amount commences. These payment increases could affect a borrower&#146;s
ability to repay the loan and lead to increased defaults and losses. At December&nbsp;31, 2009,
BankAtlantic&#146;s residential loan portfolio included $776.2&nbsp;million of interest-only loans, $65.2
million of which will become fully amortizing and have interest rates reset in 2010. The credit
scores and loan-to-value ratios for interest-only loans are similar to those of amortizing loans.
BankAtlantic has attempted to manage the credit risk associated with these loans by limiting
purchases of interest-only loans to those originated to borrowers that it believes to be credit
worthy, with loan-to-value and total debt to income ratios within agency guidelines. BankAtlantic
does not purchase or originate sub-prime, option-arm, &#147;pick-a-payment&#148; or negative amortizing
residential loans. Loans in the purchased residential loan portfolio generally do not have
prepayment penalties. As part of its initiative to reduce assets with a view toward improving
liquidity and regulatory capital ratios, BankAtlantic did not purchase any bulk residential loans
during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic also originates residential loans to customers that are then sold on a servicing
released basis to a correspondent. It also originates and holds certain residential loans, which
are made primarily to &#147;low to moderate income&#148; borrowers in accordance with requirements of the
Community Reinvestment Act. The underwriting of these loans generally follows government agency
guidelines and independent appraisers typically perform on-site inspections and valuations of the
collateral.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Commercial Real Estate: </I>BankAtlantic provides commercial real estate loans for acquisition,
development and construction of various types of properties including office buildings, retail
shopping centers, residential construction and other non-residential properties. BankAtlantic
also provides loans to acquire or refinance existing income-producing properties. These loans are
primarily secured by property located in Florida. Commercial real estate loans are generally
originated in amounts based upon the appraised value of the collateral or estimated cost to
construct, generally have a loan to value ratio at the time of origination of less than 80%, and
generally require that one or more of the principals of the borrowing entity guarantee these
loans. Most of these loans have variable interest rates and are indexed to either prime or LIBOR
rates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, we made three categories of commercial real estate loans that we believe have
resulted in significant exposure to BankAtlantic based on declines in the Florida residential real
estate market. These categories are Builder land bank loans, Land acquisition and development
loans, and Land acquisition, development and construction loans. The Builder land bank loan
category consists of land loans to borrowers who have or had land purchase option agreements with
regional and/or national builders. These loans were originally underwritten based on projected
sales of the developed lots to the builders/option holders, and timely repayment of the loans is
primarily dependent upon the sale of the property pursuant to the options. If the lots are not
sold as originally anticipated, BankAtlantic anticipates that the borrower may not be in a
position to service the loan, with the likely result being an increase in nonperforming loans and
loan losses in this category. The Land acquisition and development loan category consists of
loans secured by residential land which was intended to be developed by the borrower and sold to
homebuilders. We believe that the underwriting on these loans was generally more stringent than
Builder land bank loans, as an option agreement with a regional or national builder did not exist
at the origination date. The Land acquisition, development and construction loans are secured by
residential land which was intended to be fully developed by the borrower who also might have
plans to construct homes on the property. These loans generally involved property with a longer
investment and development horizon, and are guaranteed by the borrower or individuals such that it
is expected that the borrower will have the ability to service the debt for a longer period of
time. However, based on the declines in value in the Florida real estate market, all loans
collateralized by Florida real estate expose the Bank to significant risk.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic has also originated commercial non-residential land loans and commercial
non-residential construction loans. These loans generally have higher credit exposure than
commercial income producing commercial loans. BankAtlantic has significantly decreased the
origination of these commercial land and commercial non-residential construction loans beginning
in 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic has historically sold participations in certain commercial real estate loans
that it originated, and administers the loan and provides participants periodic reports on the
progress of the project for which the loan was made. Major decisions regarding the loans are made
by the participants on either a majority or unanimous basis. As a result, BankAtlantic generally
cannot significantly modify the loans without either majority or unanimous consent of the
participants. BankAtlantic&#146;s sale of loan participations has the effect of reducing its exposure
on individual projects and was required in some cases, in order to comply with the regulatory
&#147;loans to one borrower&#148; limitations. BankAtlantic has also purchased commercial real estate loan
participations from other financial institutions and in such cases, BankAtlantic may not be in a
position to control decisions made with respect to the loans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Standby Letters of Credit and Commitments: </I>Standby letters of credit are conditional
commitments issued by BankAtlantic to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is the same as extending loans to customers.
BankAtlantic may hold certificates of deposit, liens on corporate assets and liens on residential
and commercial property as collateral for letters of credit. BankAtlantic issues commitments for
commercial real estate and commercial business loans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Consumer: </I>Consumer loans primarily consist of loans to individuals originated through
BankAtlantic&#146;s retail network. Approximately 97% of consumer loans are home equity lines of
credit secured by a first or second mortgage on the primary residence of the borrower.
Approximately 24% of home equity lines of credit balances are secured by a first mortgage on the
property. Home equity lines of credit have pime-based interest rates and generally mature in 15
years. Other consumer loans generally have fixed interest rates with terms ranging from one to
five years. The credit quality of consumer loans is adversely impacted by increases in the
unemployment rate and declining real estate values. During 2008 and 2009, BankAtlantic experienced
higher than historical losses in this portfolio as a result of deteriorating economic conditions.
In an attempt to address this issue, BankAtlantic has adopted more stringent underwriting criteria
for consumer loans which have had the effect of significantly reducing consumer loan originations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Middle Market commercial business</I>: BankAtlantic lends on both a secured and unsecured basis,
although the majority of its loans are secured. Middle market business loans are typically
secured by the receivables, inventory, equipment, real estate, and/or general corporate assets of
the borrowers. These loans generally have variable interest rates that are Prime or LIBOR based
and are typically originated for terms ranging from one to five years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Small Business: </I>BankAtlantic originates small business loans to companies located primarily
in markets within BankAtlantic&#146;s store network. Small business loans are primarily originated on
a secured basis and generally do not exceed $1.0&nbsp;million for non-real estate secured loans and
$2.0&nbsp;million for real estate secured loans. These loans are generally originated with maturities
ranging from one to three years or upon demand; however, loans collateralized by real estate could
have terms of up to fifteen years. Lines of credit extended to small businesses are due upon
demand. Small business loans have either fixed or variable prime-based interest rates.

guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies, such as mortgage-backed securities and real
estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs), which are accounted for as securities available for
sale. BankAtlantic&#146;s securities available for sale portfolio at December&nbsp;31, 2009 reflects a
decision to seek high credit quality and securities guaranteed by government sponsored enterprises
in an attempt to minimize credit risk in its investment portfolio to the extent possible. The
available for sale securities portfolio serves as a source of liquidity as well as a means to
moderate the effects of interest rate changes. The decision to purchase and sell securities from
time to time is based upon a current assessment of the economy, the interest rate environment, and
capital and liquidity strategies and requirements. BankAtlantic&#146;s investment portfolio does not
include credit default swaps, commercial paper,
collateralized debt obligations, structured investment vehicles, auction rate securities,
trust preferred securities or equity securities in Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Tax Certificates: </I>Tax certificates are evidences of tax obligations that are sold through
auctions or bulk sales by various state and local taxing authorities. A tax obligation arises
when the property owner fails to timely pay the real estate taxes on the property. Certain
municipalities bulk sale their entire tax certificates for the prior year by auctioning the
portfolio to the highest bidder instead of auctioning each certificate separately. Tax
certificates represent a priority lien against the real property for the delinquent real estate
taxes. The minimum repayment to satisfy the lien is the certificate amount plus the interest
accrued through the redemption date, plus applicable penalties, fees and costs. Tax certificates
have no payment schedule or stated maturity. If the certificate holder does not file for the deed
within established time frames, the certificate may become null and void and lose its value.
BankAtlantic&#146;s experience with this type of investment has generally been favorable because the
rates earned are generally higher than many alternative investments and substantial repayments
typically occur over a one-year period. During 2008, BankAtlantic discontinued acquiring tax
certificates through bulk acquisitions as it experienced higher than historical losses from these
types of acquisitions. During 2009 BankAtlantic purchased tax certificates primarily in Florida
and expects that the majority of tax certificates it acquires in 2010 will be in Florida.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company operations primarily consist of financing the capital
needs of BankAtlantic and its subsidiaries and management of the asset work-out subsidiary. In
March&nbsp;2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company used a portion of the proceeds obtained from the
sale of Ryan Beck to Stifel to purchase from BankAtlantic $101.5&nbsp;million of non-performing loans at
BankAtlantic&#146;s carrying value. These loans are held in an asset workout subsidiary wholly-owned by
the BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company, which has entered into an agreement with BankAtlantic to
service the transferred non-performing loans. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company also has
arrangements with BFC for BFC to provide certain human resources, insurance management, investor
relations, and other administrative services to BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company and its
subsidiaries. The largest expense of BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company is interest expense on
junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities. BankAtlantic
Bancorp has the right to defer quarterly payments of interest on the junior subordinated debentures
for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive quarters without default or penalty. During all four
quarters during 2009 and during the first quarter of 2010, BankAtlantic Bancorp notified the
trustees under its junior subordinated debentures that it has elected to defer its quarterly
interest payments. During the deferral period, the respective trusts will likewise suspend the
declaration and payment of dividends on the trust preferred securities. Additionally, during the
deferral period, BankAtlantic Bancorp may not pay dividends on or repurchase its common stock.
BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company deferred the interest and dividend payments in order to
preserve its liquidity in response to current economic conditions. In January&nbsp;2010, BankAtlantic
Bancorp commenced cash offers to purchase the outstanding trust preferred securities. See Note 23
of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for more information regarding BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s cash tender offer for its trust preferred securities.

acquisition of another savings institution or of a savings institution that meets the QTL test and
is deemed to be a savings institution by the OTS and that will be held as a separate subsidiary,
then we would become a multiple savings and loan holding company within the meaning of HOLA and
would be subject to limitations on the types of business activities in which we can engage. HOLA
limits the activities of a multiple savings institution holding company and its non-insured

BankAtlantic must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, such as

permissible for BankAtlantic, including certain real estate equity investments and securities and
insurance brokerage. These investment powers are subject to limitations, including, among others,
limitations that require debt securities acquired by BankAtlantic to meet certain rating criteria
and that limit BankAtlantic&#146;s aggregate investment in various types of loans to certain percentages
of capital and/or assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Loans to One Borrower</I>. Under HOLA, savings banks are generally subject to the same limits on
loans to one borrower as are imposed on national banks. Generally, under these limits, the total
amount of loans and extensions of credit made by a savings bank to one borrower or related group of
borrowers outstanding at one time and not fully secured by collateral may not exceed 15% of the
savings bank&#146;s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. In addition to, and separate from, the
15% limitation, the total amount of loans and extensions of credit made by a savings bank to one
borrower or related group of borrowers outstanding at one time and fully secured by
readily-marketable collateral may not exceed 10% of the savings bank&#146;s unimpaired capital and
unimpaired surplus. Readily-marketable collateral includes certain debt and equity securities and
bullion, but generally does not include real estate. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic&#146;s limit on
loans to one borrower was approximately $76.6&nbsp;million. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic&#146;s
largest aggregate amount of loans to one borrower was approximately $37.8&nbsp;million and the second
largest borrower had an aggregate balance of approximately $36.9&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QTL Test</I>. HOLA requires a savings bank to meet a QTL test by maintaining at least 65% of its
&#147;portfolio assets&#148; in certain &#147;qualified thrift investments&#148; on a monthly average basis in at least
nine months out of every twelve months. A savings bank that fails the QTL test must either operate
under certain restrictions on its activities or convert to a bank charter. At December&nbsp;31, 2009,
BankAtlantic maintained approximately 74% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments.
BankAtlantic had also satisfied the QTL test in each of the nine months prior to December&nbsp;2009 and,
therefore, was a QTL.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of the risk-based capital
requirement, a savings bank must compute its risk-based assets by multiplying its assets and
certain off-balance sheet items by risk-weights assigned by the OTS capital regulations. The OTS
monitors the risk management of individual institutions. The OTS may impose an individual minimum
capital requirement on institutions that it believes exhibit a higher degree of risk.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements.
See Note 35 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for actual capital amounts and
ratios.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There currently are no regulatory capital requirements directly applicable to us as a unitary
savings and loan holding company apart from the regulatory capital requirements for savings banks
that are applicable to BankAtlantic; however, changes in regulations could result in additional
requirements being imposed on us.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Limitation on Capital Distributions</I>. The OTS regulations impose limitations upon certain
capital distributions by savings banks, such as certain cash dividends, payments to repurchase or
otherwise acquire its shares, payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash-out merger
and other distributions charged against capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OTS regulates all capital distributions by BankAtlantic directly or indirectly to us,
including dividend payments. BankAtlantic currently must file an application to receive the
approval of the OTS for a proposed capital distribution, as the total amount of all of
BankAtlantic&#146;s capital distributions (including any proposed capital distribution) for the
applicable calendar year exceeds BankAtlantic&#146;s net income for that year-to-date period plus
BankAtlantic&#146;s retained net income for the preceding two years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic may not pay dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp if, after paying those dividends,
it would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk-based capital guidelines and the
minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements, or in the event the OTS notified
BankAtlantic that it was in need of more than normal supervision. Under the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act, or FDIA, an insured depository institution such as BankAtlantic is prohibited from
making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such
distribution, the institution would become &#147;undercapitalized.&#148; Payment of dividends by
BankAtlantic also may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the appropriate regulator if
it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Liquidity</I>. BankAtlantic is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and
sound operation, in accordance with OTS regulations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Assessments</I>. The OTS charges assessments to recover the costs of examining savings banks and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OTS assigns institutions a rating of &#147;outstanding,&#148; &#147;satisfactory,&#148; &#147;needs to improve,&#148; or
&#147;substantial non-compliance.&#148; The CRA requires all institutions to disclose their CRA ratings to
the public. BankAtlantic received a &#147;satisfactory&#148; rating in its most recent CRA evaluation.
Regulations also require all institutions to disclose certain agreements that are in fulfillment of
the CRA. BankAtlantic has no such agreements in place at this time.

Regulation&nbsp;W of the Federal Reserve Board, or FRB, implementing Sections&nbsp;23A and 23B of the FRA,
and by OTS regulations. The applicable OTS regulations for savings banks regarding transactions
with affiliates generally conform to the requirements of Regulation&nbsp;W, which is applicable to
national banks. In general, an affiliate of a savings bank is any company that controls, is
controlled by, or is under common control with, the savings bank, other than the savings bank&#146;s
subsidiaries. For instance, we are deemed an affiliate of BankAtlantic under these regulations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, Section&nbsp;23A limits the extent to which a savings bank may engage in &#147;covered
transactions&#148; with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of the savings bank&#146;s capital stock
and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an
amount equal to 20% of the savings bank&#146;s capital stock and surplus. A covered transaction

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Enforcement</I>. Under the FDIA, the OTS has primary enforcement responsibility over savings
banks and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all &#147;institution-affiliated
parties,&#148; including any controlling stockholder or any shareholder, attorney, appraiser and
accountant who knowingly or recklessly participates in any violation of applicable law or
regulation, breach of fiduciary duty, or certain other wrongful actions that have, or are likely to
have, a significant adverse effect on an insured savings bank or cause it more than minimal loss.
In addition, the FDIC has back-up authority to take enforcement action for unsafe and unsound
practices. Formal enforcement action can include the issuance of a capital directive, cease and
desist order, removal of officers and/or directors, institution of proceedings for receivership or
conservatorship and termination of deposit insurance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Examination</I>. A savings institution must demonstrate to the OTS its ability to manage its
compliance responsibilities by establishing an effective and comprehensive oversight and monitoring
program. The degree of compliance oversight and monitoring by the institution&#146;s management impacts
the scope and intensity of the OTS&#146; examinations of the institution. Institutions with significant
management oversight and monitoring of compliance will generally receive less extensive OTS
examinations than institutions with less oversight.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Standards for Safety and Soundness</I>. Pursuant to the requirements of the FDIA, the OTS,
together with the other federal bank regulatory agencies, has adopted the Interagency Guidelines
Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness, or the Guidelines. The Guidelines establish
general safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls, information and internal
audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset
quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the Guidelines require, among
other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures
specified in the Guidelines. If the OTS determines that a savings bank fails to meet any standard
established by the Guidelines, then the OTS may require the savings bank to submit to the OTS an
acceptable plan to achieve compliance. If a savings bank fails to comply, the OTS may seek an
enforcement order in judicial proceedings and impose civil monetary penalties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shared National Credit Program</I>. The Shared National Credit Program is an interagency program,
established in 1977, to provide a periodic credit risk assessment of the largest and most complex
syndicated loans held or agented by financial institutions subject to supervision by a federal bank
regulatory agency. The Shared National Credit Program is administered by the FRB, FDIC, OTS and
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Shared National Credit Program covers any loan
or loan commitment of at least $20&nbsp;million (i)&nbsp;which is shared under a formal lending agreement by
three or more unaffiliated financial institutions or (ii)&nbsp;a portion of which is sold to two or more
unaffiliated financial institutions with the purchasing financial institutions assuming their pro
rata share of the credit risk. The Shared National Credit Program is designed to provide
uniformity and efficiency in the federal banking agencies&#146; analysis and rating of the largest and
most complex credit facilities in the country by avoiding duplicate credit reviews and ensuring
consistency in rating determinations. The federal banking agencies use a combination of
statistical and judgmental sampling techniques to select borrowers for review each year. The
selected borrowers are reviewed and the credit quality rating assigned by the applicable federal
banking agency&#146;s examination team will be reported to each financial institution that participates
in the loan as of the examination date. The assigned ratings are used during examinations of the
other financial institutions to avoid duplicate reviews and ensure consistent treatment of these
loans. BankAtlantic has entered into participations with respect to certain of its loans and has
acquired participations in the loans of other financial institutions which are subject to this
program and accordingly these loans may be subject to this additional review.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Real Estate Lending Standards</I>. The OTS and the other federal banking agencies adopted
regulations to prescribe standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens on or
interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing the construction of improvements
on real estate. The OTS regulations require each savings bank to establish and maintain written
internal real estate lending standards that are consistent with OTS guidelines and with safe and
sound banking practices and which are appropriate to the size of the savings bank and the nature
and scope of its real estate lending activities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action</I>. Under the OTS Prompt Corrective Action Regulations, the
OTS is required to take certain, and is authorized to take other, supervisory actions against
undercapitalized savings banks, such as requiring compliance with a capital restoration plan,
restricting asset growth, acquisitions, branching and new lines of business and, in extreme cases,
appointment of a receiver or conservator. The severity of the action required or authorized to be
taken increases as a savings bank&#146;s capital deteriorates. Savings banks are classified
into five categories of capitalization as &#147;well capitalized,&#148; &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148;
&#147;undercapitalized,&#148; &#147;significantly undercapitalized,&#148; and &#147;critically undercapitalized.&#148;
Generally, a savings bank is categorized as &#147;well capitalized&#148; if:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OTS categorized BankAtlantic as &#147;well capitalized&#148; following its last examination and
BankAtlantic remained categorized &#147;well capitalized&#148; as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. However, there is no
assurance that it will continue to be deemed &#147;well capitalized&#148; even if current capital ratios are
maintained where asset quality continues to deteriorate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Insurance of Deposit Accounts</I>. Savings banks are subject to a risk-based assessment system
for determining the deposit insurance assessments to be paid by them.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until December&nbsp;31, 2006, the FDIC had assigned each savings institution to one of three
capital categories based on the savings institution&#146;s financial information as of its most recent
quarterly financial report filed with the applicable bank regulatory agency prior to the assessment
period. The FDIC had also assigned each savings institution to one of three supervisory
subcategories within each capital category based upon a supervisory evaluation provided to the FDIC
by the savings institution&#146;s primary federal regulator and information that the FDIC determined to
be relevant to the savings institution&#146;s financial condition and the risk posed to the previously
existing deposit insurance funds. A savings institution&#146;s deposit insurance assessment rate
depended on the capital category and supervisory subcategory to which it was assigned. Insurance
assessment rates ranged from 0.00% of deposits for a savings institution in the highest category
(i.e., well capitalized and financially sound, with no more than a few minor weaknesses) to 0.27%
of deposits for a savings institution in the lowest category (i.e., undercapitalized and
substantial supervisory concern).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;1, 2007, the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005, or the Reform Act,
became effective. The Reform Act, among other things, merged the Bank Insurance Fund and the
Savings Association Insurance Fund, both of which were administered by the FDIC, into a new fund
administered by the FDIC known as the Deposit Insurance Fund, or DIF, and increased the coverage
limit for certain retirement plan deposits to $250,000, but maintained the basic insurance coverage
limit of $100,000 for other depositors. On October&nbsp;3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act of 2008, or the Stabilization Act, temporarily raised the basic insurance coverage limit to
$250,000. This temporary increase in the basic insurance coverage limit will expire on December
31, 2013 and the basic insurance coverage limit will return to $100,000 on January&nbsp;1, 2014.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Reform Act, the FDIC now assigns each savings institution to one of four
risk categories based upon the savings institution&#146;s capital evaluation and supervisory evaluation.
The capital evaluation is based upon financial information as of the savings institution&#146;s most
recent quarterly financial report filed with the applicable bank regulatory agency at the end of
each quarterly assessment period. The supervisory evaluation is based upon the results of
examination findings by the savings institution&#146;s primary federal regulator and information that
the FDIC has determined to be relevant to the savings institution&#146;s financial condition and the
risk posed to the DIF. A savings institution&#146;s deposit insurance base assessment rate depends on
the risk category to which it is assigned. In April&nbsp;2009, the FDIC implemented regulations to
improve the way its insurance base assessment rates differentiate risk among insured institutions
and make the risk-based system fairer by limiting the subsidization of riskier institutions by
safer institutions. For the quarter which began January&nbsp;1, 2010, insurance base assessment rates
range from 12 cents per $100 (but could be as low as 7 cents per $100, after computing applicable
adjustments) in assessable deposits for a savings institution in the least risk category (i.e.,
well capitalized and financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses) to 45 cents per $100 (but
could be as high as 77.5 cents per $100, after computing applicable adjustments) in assessable
deposits for a savings institution in the most risk category (i.e., undercapitalized and poses a
substantial probability of loss to the DIF unless effective corrective action is taken)
BankAtlantic&#146;s FICE deposit insurance premium increased from $2.8&nbsp;million for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008 to $8.6&nbsp;million for the same 2009 period.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIC is authorized to raise the assessment rates in certain circumstances, which would
affect savings institutions in all risk categories. The FDIC is also authorized to impose special
assessments. The FDIC has exercised its authority to raise assessment rates and impose special
assessments several times in the past, including during 2009, and could raise rates and impose
special assessments in the future. Increases in deposit insurance premiums and the imposition of
special assessments would have an adverse effect on our earnings. BankAtlantic paid a $2.4&nbsp;million
FDIC special assessment for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Privacy and Security Protection</I>. BankAtlantic is subject to the OTS regulations implementing
the privacy and security protection provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA. These
regulations require a savings bank to disclose to its customers and consumers its policy and
practices with respect to the privacy, and sharing with nonaffiliated third parties, of its
customers and consumers&#146; &#147;nonpublic personal information.&#148; Additionally, in certain instances,
BankAtlantic is required to provide its customers and consumers with the ability to &#147;opt-out&#148; of
having BankAtlantic share their nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties.
These regulations also require savings banks to maintain policies and procedures to safeguard their
customers and consumers&#146; nonpublic personal information. BankAtlantic has policies and procedures
designed to comply with GLBA and applicable privacy and security regulations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Insurance Activities</I>. BankAtlantic is generally permitted to engage in certain insurance
activities through its subsidiaries. The OTS regulations implemented pursuant to GLBA prohibit,
among other things, depository institutions from conditioning the extension of credit to
individuals upon either the purchase of an insurance product or annuity or an agreement by the
consumer not to purchase an insurance product or annuity from an entity that is not affiliated with
the depository institution. The regulations also require prior disclosure of this prohibition to
potential insurance product or annuity customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Federal Home Loan Bank System</I>. BankAtlantic is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank, or
FHLB, of Atlanta, which is one of the twelve regional FHLB&#146;s composing the FHLB system. Each FHLB
provides a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions as well as other entities
involved in home mortgage lending. Any advances from a FHLB must be secured by specified types of
collateral, and all long-term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for
residential housing finance. As a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, BankAtlantic is required to
acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB of Atlanta. BankAtlantic was in compliance
with this requirement with an investment in FHLB of Atlanta stock at December&nbsp;31, 2009 of
approximately $48.8&nbsp;million. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, the FHLB of Atlanta paid
dividends of approximately $0.2&nbsp;million on the capital stock held by BankAtlantic. The FHLB did
not pay a dividend during the first six months of 2009 and in February&nbsp;2009 suspended excess stock
redemptions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Federal Reserve System</I>. BankAtlantic is subject to provisions of the FRA and the FRB&#146;s
regulations, pursuant to which depository institutions may be required to maintain
non-interest-earning reserves against their deposit accounts and certain other liabilities.
Currently, federal savings banks must maintain reserves against transaction accounts (primarily NOW
and regular interest and non-interest bearing checking accounts). The FRB regulations establish
the specific rates of reserves that must be maintained, which are subject to adjustment by the FRB.
BankAtlantic is currently in compliance with those reserve requirements. The required reserves
must be maintained in the form of vault cash, a non-interest-bearing account at a Federal Reserve
Bank, or a pass-through account as defined by the FRB. The FRB pays targeted federal funds rates
on the required reserves which are lower than the yield on our traditional investments.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Anti-Terrorism and Anti-Money Laundering Regulations</I>. The Uniting and Strengthening America
by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA
PATRIOT Act, provides the federal government with additional powers to address terrorist threats
through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information
sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy
Act, or BSA, the USA PATRIOT Act puts in place measures intended to encourage information sharing
among bank regulatory and law enforcement agencies. In addition, certain provisions of the USA
PATRIOT Act impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including
savings banks.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the USA PATRIOT Act requires each financial institution to develop a customer
identification program, or CIP, as part of its anti-money laundering program. The key components
of the CIP are identification, verification, government list comparison, notice and record
retention. The purpose of the CIP is to enable the financial institution to determine the true
identity and anticipated account activity of each customer. To make this determination, among
other things, the financial institution must collect certain information from customers at the
time they enter into the customer relationship with the financial institution. This information
must be verified within a reasonable time through documentary and non-documentary methods.
Furthermore, all customers must be screened against any CIP-related government lists of known or
suspected terrorists.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The USA Patriot Act established the Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#147;OFAC&#148;), which is a
division of the Treasury Department, and is responsible for helping to ensure that United States
entities do not engage in transactions with &#147;enemies&#148; of the United States, as defined by various
Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC has sent banking regulatory agencies lists of names of
persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts. If
BankAtlantic identifies a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC
list, it must freeze or reject such account or transaction, evaluate the need to file a suspicious
activity report and notify the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&#147;FinCEN&#148;).

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vacation ownership and real estate industries are subject to extensive and complex
federal, state, and local governmental regulation. Federal, state, local and foreign environmental,
zoning, consumer protection and other statutes regulate the acquisition, subdivision, marketing and
sale of real estate and VOIs. On a federal level, the Federal Trade Commission has taken an active
regulatory role through the Federal Trade Commission Act, prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts and
unfair competition in interstate commerce. Vacation ownership interests are subject to various
regulatory requirements including state and local approvals. The laws of most states require the
filing of a detailed offering statement which provides disclosure of all material aspects of the
project and sale of VOIs. Laws in each state where VOIs are sold generally grant the purchaser of
a VOI the right to cancel a purchase contract at any time within a specified rescission period.
There is also no assurance that in the future, VOIs will not be deemed to be securities subject to
securities regulation. Most states also have other laws that regulate: real estate licensure;
sellers of travel licensure; anti-fraud laws; telemarketing laws; prize, gift and sweepstakes laws;
and, labor laws. In addition, we may be subject to the Fair Housing Act and various other federal
statutes and regulations. The sales and marketing of homesites are subject to various consumer
protection laws and to the Federal Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, which establishes strict guidelines with respect to
the marketing and sale of land in interstate commerce.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no assurance that the cost of complying with applicable laws and regulations will not
be significant. Any failure to comply with current or future laws or regulations applicable to the
sale of VOIs or real estate could have a material adverse effect on us.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been significant dislocation in the real estate markets. Land values have
deteriorated significantly, and lenders who have foreclosed on properties throughout the United
States and particularly in those areas where the Company and its subsidiaries operate are selling
properties at significant discounts. The purchasers of such properties may have a significantly
lower basis than we have and accordingly such purchasers have a competitive advantage with respect
to the development or resale of those properties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen Resorts competes with various high profile and well-established operators, many of
which have greater liquidity and financial resources than Bluegreen. Many of the world&#146;s most
recognized lodging, hospitality and entertainment companies develop and sell VOIs in resort
properties. Major companies that now operate or are developing or planning to develop vacation
ownership resorts directly or through subsidiaries include Marriott International, Inc., the Walt
Disney Company, Hilton Hotels Corporation, Hyatt Corporation, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts,
Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Inc. and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation. Bluegreen Resorts
also competes with numerous other smaller owners and operators of vacation ownership resorts. In
addition to competing for sales leads, prospects and service contracts, Bluegreen Resorts competes
with other VOI developers for marketing, sales, and resort management personnel.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Financial Services</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banking and financial services industry is very competitive and is in transition. The
financial services industry is experiencing a severe downturn and there is increased competition in
the marketplace. We expect continued consolidation in the financial service industry creating
larger financial institutions. BankAtlantic&#146;s primary method of competition is emphasis on
relationship banking, customer service and convenience, including its Florida&#146;s Most Convenient
Bank initiative.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic faces substantial competition for both loans and deposits. Competition for loans
comes principally from other banks, savings institutions and other lenders. This competition could
decrease the number and size of loans that BankAtlantic makes and the interest rates and fees that
BankAtlantic receives on these loans. .BankAtlantic competes for deposits with banks, savings
institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives,
including money market funds and mutual funds, many of which are uninsured. These competitors may
offer higher interest rates than BankAtlantic, which could decrease the deposits that Bank Atlantic
attracts or require BankAtlantic to increase its rates to attract new deposits. Increased
competition for deposits could increase BankAtlantic&#146;s cost of funds, reduce its net interest
margin and adversely affect its results of operations.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>We have in the past incurred cash flow deficits at the BFC parent company level which we expect
will continue in the future.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC is engaged in making investments in operating businesses and, in the past, BFC Parent has
not had revenue generating operating activities. We have in the past incurred cash flow deficits
at BFC Parent and expect to continue to incur cash flow deficits in the foreseeable future. We
have financed these operating cash flow deficits with available working capital, issuances of
equity or debt securities, and with dividends from our subsidiaries. BFC Parent is dependent upon
dividends from its subsidiaries to fund its operations. Currently, BankAtlantic Bancorp is
restricted from paying dividends and these restrictions may continue in the future. In addition,
Bluegreen has historically not paid dividends on its common stock. As a result, if cash flow is
not sufficient to fund our operating expenses in the future, we may be forced to reduce operating
expenses, to liquidate some of our investments or to seek to fund our operations from the proceeds
of additional equity or debt financing. There is no assurance that any such financing would be
available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that we would not be forced to liquidate
our investments at depressed prices.

in which our subsidiaries operate could continue to adversely impact our results and future growth.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s business, the location of BankAtlantic&#146;s branches and the real estate
collateralizing its commercial real estate loans and home equity loans are concentrated in Florida.
Further, our operations are concentrated in Florida and South Carolina. Economic conditions
generally, and the economies of both Florida and South Carolina in particular have adversely
impacted our results and operations. Further, each of these states is subject to the risks of
natural disasters, such as tropical storms and hurricanes. The continued impact of the economic
downturn, natural disasters or adverse changes in laws or regulations applicable to the companies
could impact the credit quality of BankAtlantic&#146;s assets, the desirability of our properties, the
financial condition and performance of our customers and our overall success. In addition,
Bluegreen&#146;s operations, which are primarily conducted within the vacation ownership and real estate
industry, have also been adversely impacted by the current economic downturn. The persistence or
further deterioration of the current adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse
effect on our business and results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our primary holdings consist of our direct and indirect investments in BankAtlantic Bancorp,
Bluegreen, Core, Pizza Fusion and Benihana. As a result, we are subject to the risks faced by these
companies in their respective industries. Each has been adversely affected by a downturn in the
economy, loss of consumer confidence and disruptions in the credit markets. Our current business
plan includes a focus on providing strategic support to the companies within our consolidated
group, and in which we hold investments. Such support may include further investments in those
companies. Any such additional investments will further expose us to the risks faced by those

rights in connection with the Merger.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Florida law, holders of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock who did not vote to approve
the Woodbridge Merger and who properly asserted and exercised their appraisal rights with respect
to their shares (&#147;Dissenting Holders&#148;) are entitled to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to
the fair value of their shares (as determined in accordance with the provisions of Florida law) in
lieu of the shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock which they would otherwise have been entitled to
receive. Dissenting Holders, who owned in the aggregate approximately 4.6&nbsp;million shares of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, provided written notice to Woodbridge regarding their intent to
exercise their appraisal rights. In accordance with Florida law, Woodbridge provided written
notices and required forms to the Dissenting Holders setting forth, among other things, its
determination that the fair value of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock immediately prior to the
effectiveness of the Merger was $1.10 per share. Dissenting Holders were required to return their
appraisal forms by November&nbsp;10, 2009 and indicate on their appraisal forms whether the Dissenting
Holder chose to (i)&nbsp;accept Woodbridge&#146;s offer of $1.10 per share in cash, or (ii)&nbsp;demand payment of
the fair value estimate determined by the Dissenting Holder plus interest. As of the date of this
filing, one Dissenting Holder which held approximately 400,000 shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock had withdrawn its shares from the appraisal rights process, while the remaining
Dissenting Holders, who collectively held approximately 4.2&nbsp;million shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock, have rejected Woodbridge&#146;s offer of $1.10 per share and requested payment for their
shares based on their respective views of the fair value of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock prior
to the merger. In December&nbsp;2009, the Company recorded a $4.6&nbsp;million liability with a corresponding
reduction to additional paid-in capital representing, in the aggregate, Woodbridge&#146;s offer to the
Dissenting Holders. However, the appraisal rights litigation is currently ongoing and its outcome
is uncertain. As a result, there is no assurance as to the amount of cash that Woodbridge will be
required to pay to the Dissenting Holders and such amount may be greater than the $4.6&nbsp;million that
we have accrued. Any significant increase in Woodbridge&#146;s obligation to Dissenting Holders who
exercise their appraisal rights could have a material adverse effect on BFC&#146;s and Woodbridge&#146;s
businesses.

Exchange. Decisions made by BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Board are not within our control and may not be
made in our best interests.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The declaration and payment of dividends and the ability of BankAtlantic Bancorp to meet its
debt service obligations will depend upon adequate cash holdings, which are driven by the results
of operations, financial condition and cash requirements of BankAtlantic Bancorp, and the ability
of BankAtlantic to pay dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp. The ability of BankAtlantic to pay
dividends or make other distributions to BankAtlantic Bancorp is subject to regulations and prior
approval of the Office of Thrift Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;). The OTS would not approve any distribution
that would cause BankAtlantic to fail to meet its capital requirements or if the OTS believes that
a capital distribution by BankAtlantic would constitute an unsafe or unsound action or practice,
and there is no assurance that the OTS would approve future applications for capital distributions
from BankAtlantic. During the first quarter of 2009, BankAtlantic suspended the payment of
dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp and BankAtlantic has indicated that it does not intend to seek to
make any capital distributions for the foreseeable future. In February&nbsp;2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp
elected to exercise its right to defer payments of interest on its trust preferred junior
subordinated debt. BankAtlantic Bancorp is permitted to defer quarterly interest payments for up to
20 consecutive quarters. During the deferral period, BankAtlantic Bancorp is prohibited from
paying dividends to its shareholders, including BFC. While BankAtlantic Bancorp can end the
deferral period at any time, BankAtlantic Bancorp has indicated that it anticipates that is may
continue to defer such interest payments for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, BFC does not
expect to receive dividends from BankAtlantic Bancorp for the foreseeable future.

assessing the amortization /accretion of purchase accounting fair value differences and the future

may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If any estimates,
judgments or assumptions change in the future, or our actual results differ from our estimates or

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have experienced and continue to experience net operating losses. Under the Internal
Revenue Code, we may utilize our net operating loss carryforwards in certain circumstances to
offset future taxable income and to reduce federal income tax liability, subject to certain
requirements and restrictions. The Woodbridge merger, which was consummated on September&nbsp;21, 2009,
resulted in an &#147;ownership change&#148;, as defined in Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a
result, our ability in the future to use our historic net operating loss carryforwards will be
substantially limited, which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of
operations. However, we believe that BFC may utilize Woodbridge&#146;s net operating loss
carryforwards. Accordingly, in September&nbsp;2009, our Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights
plan designed to preserve shareholder value and protect our ability to use Woodbridge&#146;s net
operating loss carryforwards by providing a deterrent to holders of less than 5% of our common
stock from acquiring a 5% or greater ownership interest in our common stock. However, there is no
assurance that the shareholder rights plan will successfully prevent against an &#147;ownership change&#148;
or otherwise preserve our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset any
future taxable income, nor is there any assurance that we will be in a position to utilize our net
operating loss carryforwards in the future even if we do not experience an &#147;ownership change.&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock generally vote together as a single class.
The Class&nbsp;A Common Stock possesses in the aggregate 22% of the total voting power of all our common
stock and the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock possesses in the aggregate the remaining 78% of the total voting
power. These relative voting percentages will remain fixed unless the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock outstanding decreases to 1,800,000 shares, at which time the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock&#146;s
aggregate voting power will increase to 40% and the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock will have the remaining
60%. If the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock outstanding decreases to 1,400,000 shares, the
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock&#146;s aggregate voting power will increase to 53% and the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock
will have the remaining 47%. These relative voting percentages will remain fixed unless the number
of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock outstanding decreases to 500,000 shares, at which time the fixed
voting percentages will be eliminated. These changes in the relative voting power represented by
each class of our common stock are based only on the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock
outstanding. Thus issuances of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock will have no effect on these provisions. If
additional shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock are issued, it is likely that the disparity between the
equity interest represented by the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock and its voting power will widen. While the

the trading price and market for our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock would be adversely affected.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenders with respect to approximately $37.2&nbsp;million of debt owed by Woodbridge and all of the
approximately $209.9&nbsp;million of debt owed by Core have declared the debt to be in default. While
Woodbridge is disputing the fact that an event of default occurred under the terms of its
indebtedness and is currently in negotiations with respect to the purported default with the FDIC
(which holds the debt as a result of the failure of the lender), Core is currently pursuing all
options with its lenders, including offering deeds in lieu of foreclosure with respect to the
property collateralizing its loans. If these negotiations and efforts are not successful, the
lenders may exercise remedies available to them as a result of the defaults, which may result in
judgments against the obligors, the loss of the collateral and related losses beyond those
previously incurred. This would be expected to materially and adversely impact our financial
condition and operating results.

orderly liquidation of its assets.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed throughout this report, Core is experiencing cash flow deficits. The significant
decrease in land sales in 2009 and continued cash flow deficits contributed to, among other things,
the deterioration of Core&#146;s liquidity. As a result, Core has severely limited its development
expenditures in Tradition, Florida and has completely discontinued development activity in
Tradition Hilton Head. The value of Core&#146;s assets has decreased, resulting in $78.0&nbsp;million of
impairment charges, including $13.6&nbsp;million of impairment charges related to assets held for sale during 2009. Further, as described above, Core is currently in default under
the terms of all of its loans. Core has commenced negotiations with its lenders in an effort to
achieve an orderly liquidation of its operations without a bankruptcy filing, but there is no
assurance that Core will be successful in its negotiations. If Core is not successful in its
efforts to liquidate its assets or otherwise renegotiate its debt with its lenders, Core may need
to pursue a bankruptcy filing and may be required to record additional impairment charges and
losses beyond those previously incurred, which would likely have a material and adverse impact on
our financial condition and operating results.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core established community development district and special assessment district bonds to
access tax-exempt bond financing to fund infrastructure development at Core&#146;s master-planned
communities. Core is responsible for any assessed amounts until the underlying property is sold.
Accordingly, if Core continues to hold certain of its properties longer than originally projected
(as a result of a continued downturn in the real estate markets or otherwise), Core may be required
to pay a higher portion of annual assessments on such properties. In addition, Core could be
required to pay down a portion of the bonds in the event its entitlements were to decrease as to
the number of residential units and/or commercial space that can be built on the properties
encumbered by the bonds. Moreover, Core has guaranteed payments for assessments under the district
bonds in Tradition, Florida which would require funding if future assessments to be allocated to
property owners are insufficient to repay the bonds.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may not be able to maintain our overall occupancy levels in the commercial property we own.
Our ability to continue to lease or re-lease vacant space in our commercial properties will be
affected by many factors, including our properties&#146; locations, current market conditions and the
provisions of the leases we enter into with the tenants at our properties. In fact, many of the
factors which could cause our current tenants to vacate their space could also make it more
difficult for us to re-lease that space. If we are able to re-lease vacated space, there is no
assurance that rental rates will be equal to or in excess of current rental rates. In addition, we
may incur substantial costs in obtaining new tenants, including brokerage commission fees paid by
us in connection with new leases or
lease renewals, and the cost of leasehold improvements. The failure to lease or to re-lease
vacant space on satisfactory terms will have an adverse effect on our operating results.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>RISKS RELATED TO BLUEGREEN</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Bluegreen presents its results in two reportable segments. Bluegreen&#146;s results of operations
for the Bluegreen Interim Period are consolidated in BFC Financial Corporation&#146;s financial
statements. Bluegreen is a separate public company and its management prepared the following
discussion regarding Bluegreen which was included in Bluegreen&#146;s Annual Report on </I><I>Form 10-K</I><I> for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
March&nbsp;31, 2010. Accordingly, references to &#147;we&#148;, &#147;us&#148; or &#147;our&#148; in this section are references to
Bluegreen and its subsidiaries, and are not references to BFC, Woodbridge, or BankAtlantic Bancorp.</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to or arising out of the nature of
our business and general business, economic, financing, legal and other factors or conditions that
may affect us. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive, highly regulated and rapidly changing
environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to
either predict all risk factors, or assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the
extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may affect our business. These risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited, to the risk factors set forth below and those
identified elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in the section entitled
&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148;. Investors
should also refer to our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K (available
on our website and the SEC&#146;s website) in future periods for information relating to risks and
uncertainties with respect to us and our business.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>The state of the economy, generally, interest rates and the availability of financing affect our
ability to market VOIs and residential homesites.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our business has been adversely affected by unfavorable general economic and industry conditions,
including effects of weak domestic and world economies, rising unemployment and job insecurity, a
decrease in discretionary spending, a decline in housing values, limited availability of
financing, and geopolitical conflicts. If such conditions continue, or deteriorate further, our
business and results may continue to be adversely impacted, particularly if the availability of
financing for us or for our customers continues to be limited or if changes in general economic
conditions adversely affect our customers ability to pay amounts owed under our notes receivable.
Further, because our operations are conducted mainly within the vacation ownership industry, any
adverse changes affecting the industry, such as an oversupply of vacation ownership units, a
reduction in demand for such units, changes in travel and vacation patterns, changes in
governmental regulation of the industry, continued disruptions in the credit markets and
unavailability of financing, imposition of increased taxes by governmental authorities, the
declaration of bankruptcy and/or credit defaults by other vacation ownership companies and
negative publicity for the industry, could also have a material adverse effect on our business.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>We would incur substantial losses if the customers we finance default on their obligations, and
new credit underwriting standards may not have the anticipated favorable impact on performance.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Historically, we did not perform credit checks of the purchasers of our VOIs at the time of sale
in connection with our financing of their purchases. From time to time, however, we obtained
FICO<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> scores on the overall VOI portfolio originated by us. Based on a review conducted in
October&nbsp;2008, approximately 30.4% of VOI borrowers in our serviced loan portfolio had a FICO<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>
score below 620. Effective December&nbsp;15, 2008, we implemented a formal FICO<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> score based credit
underwriting program. However, there is no assurance that any of these FICO<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> score-based underwriting standards will result in decreased default rates or otherwise improve the
performance of our receivables. Conditions in the mortgage industry, including both credit
sources as well as borrowers&#146; financial profiles, have deteriorated in recent years. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2009, approximately 5.4% of our vacation ownership receivables and approximately
22.5% of residential land receivables which we held or which third parties held under sales
transactions were more than 30&nbsp;days past due. Although in many cases we may have recourse
against a buyer for the unpaid purchase price, certain states have laws that limit our ability to
recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans or the cost of
doing so may not be justified. Historically, we have generally not pursued such recourse against
our customers. In the case of our VOI receivables, if we are unable to collect the defaulted
amount due, we traditionally have terminated the customer&#146;s interest in the Bluegreen Vacation
Club and then remarketed the recovered VOI. Irrespective of our remedy in the event of a
default, we cannot recover the marketing, selling and administrative costs associated with the
original sale, and we would have to incur such costs again to resell the VOI or home site. If
default rates for our borrowers increase further, it may require an increase in the provision for
loan losses and an impairment of the value of our retained interests in notes receivable sold.
In addition, it may cause buyers of, or lenders whose loans are secured by, our VOI notes
receivable to reduce the amount of availability under receivables purchase and credit facilities,
or to increase the interest costs associated with such facilities. In such an event, the cost of
financing may increase and we may not be able to secure financing on terms acceptable to us, if
at all, which would adversely affect our earnings, financial position and liquidity.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Under the terms of our pledged and receivable sale facilities, we may be required, under certain
circumstances, to replace receivables or to pay down the loan to within permitted loan-to-value
ratios. Additionally, the terms of our securitization-type transactions i.) require us to
repurchase or replace loans if we breach any of the representations and warranties we made at the
time we sold the receivables and ii.) include provisions that in the event of defaults by
customers in excess of stated thresholds would require substantially all of our cash flow from
our retained interest in the receivable portfolios sold to be paid to the parties who purchased
the receivables from us.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Further, if defaults and other performance criteria adversely differ from estimates used to value
our retained interests in notes receivable sold in the securitization transactions, we may be
required to write down these assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations. Accordingly, we bear some risks of delinquencies and defaults by buyers who finance
the purchase of their VOIs or residential land through us, regardless of whether or not we sell
or pledge the buyer&#146;s loan to a third party.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Our business plan historically has depended on our ability to sell or borrow against our notes
receivable to support our liquidity and profitability</I></B><B>.</B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We offer financing of up to 90% of the purchase price to purchasers of our VOIs and homesites.
Approximately 68% of our VOI customers and approximately 6% of our home site customers utilized
our in-house financing during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. However, we incur selling,
marketing and administrative cash expenditures prior to and concurrent with the sale. These costs
generally exceed the down payment we receive at the time of the sale. Accordingly, our ability to
borrow against or sell the notes receivable we receive from our customers has been a critical
factor in our continued liquidity.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have also been a party to a number of customary securitization-type transactions under which we
sell receivables to a wholly-owned special purpose entity which, in turn, sells the receivables to
a trust established for the transaction. We typically recognized gains on the sale of receivables
and such gains have historically comprised a significant portion of our income. In recent years,
the markets for notes receivable facilities and receivable securitization transactions were
negatively impacted by problems in the residential mortgage markets and credit markets in general
and an associated reduction in liquidity which resulted in reduced availability of financing and
less favorable pricing. If our pledged receivables facilities terminate or expire and we are
unable to replace them with comparable facilities, or if we are unable to continue to participate
in securitization-type transactions on acceptable terms, our liquidity, cash flow, and
profitability would be materially and adversely affected. If any of our current facilities
terminate or expire, there is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the pledge or sale of
our notes receivable at favorable rates, or at all.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>While we have attempted to restructure our business to reduce our need for and reliance on
financing for liquidity in the short term, there is no assurance that such restructuring will be
successful or that our business and profitability will not otherwise continue to depend on our
ability to obtain financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have historically depended on funds from our credit facilities and securitization transactions
to finance our operations. In recent years, there have been unprecedented disruptions in the credit
markets, which has made obtaining additional and replacement external sources of liquidity more
difficult and more costly. The term securitization market has experienced significantly reduced
volumes in recent years and, as a result, financial institutions are reluctant to enter into new
credit facilities for the purpose of providing financing on consumer receivables. Several lenders
to the timeshare industry, including certain of our lenders, have announced that they will be
either be exiting the finance business or will not be entering into new financing commitments for
the foreseeable future, although such lenders continue to honor existing commitments. In addition,
financing for real estate acquisition and development and the capital markets for corporate debt
have been generally unavailable. In response to these conditions, we adopted strategic initiatives
in an attempt to conserve cash. Further, because we had debt facilities maturing or
requiring partial repayment in 2009 and 2010, as well as facilities for which the advance period
has or will expire, the implementation of our strategic initiatives was needed to address these
matters with our lenders. However, there is no assurance that our implementation of these
strategic initiatives will enhance our financial position or otherwise be successful. If these
initiatives do not have their intended results, our financial condition may be materially and
adversely impacted.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, notwithstanding our implementation of the strategic initiatives described above, we
anticipate that we will continue to finance our future business activities, in part, with funds
that we obtain pursuant to additional borrowings under our existing credit facilities, under
credit facilities that we may obtain in the future, under securitizations in which we may
participate in the future or pursuant to other borrowing arrangements. Moreover, we are, and will
be, required to seek continued external sources of liquidity to:</DIV>

credit markets and on our future performance, which is subject to a number of factors, including
the success of our business, results of operations, leverage, financial condition and business
prospects, prevailing interest rates, general economic conditions and perceptions about the
residential land and vacation ownership industries. We have approximately $87.5&nbsp;million of
indebtedness which becomes due during 2010. While we have received a non-binding term sheet to
refinance $40.2&nbsp;million of this amount which would reduce our contractual obligations less than one year by $26.6&nbsp;million, there
can be no assurances that this transaction will close on favorable terms, if at all. Historically,
much of Bluegreen&#146;s debt has been renewed or refinanced in the ordinary course of business. But
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient external sources of liquidity on
attractive terms, or at all, or otherwise renew, extend or refinance a significant portion of our

of which are as yet unknown and many economists and financial analysts, as well as the media in
general, believe that we are in the midst of a general economic recession. These circumstances
have exerted pressure upon our Bluegreen Communities and Bluegreen Resorts divisions. Further, a
continued deterioration of the economy in general or the market for residential land or VOIs
would have a material adverse effect on our business.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The availability of land at favorable prices for the development of our Bluegreen Resorts and
Bluegreen Communities real estate projects by the time we will need more real estate inventory to
sell is critical to our profitability and the ability to cover our significant selling, general
and administrative expenses, cost of capital and other expenses. While we believe that the
property we have purchased at our adjusted carrying amounts will generate appropriate margins,
land prices have fallen significantly and the projects we bought in the last several years may
have been bought at higher price levels than available in the current market. If we are unable
to acquire such land or, in the case of Bluegreen Resorts, resort properties, at a favorable
cost, it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The profitability of our real estate development activities is also impacted by the cost of
construction materials and services. Should the cost of construction materials and services
rise, the ultimate cost of our Bluegreen Resorts&#146; and Bluegreen Communities&#146; inventories when
developed could increase and have a material, adverse impact on our results of operations.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The initial adoption of FASB ASC 860-10 and FASB ASC 810-10 in our 2010 first quarter will require
us to consolidate our existing qualifying special purpose entities associated with past
securitization transactions. As such, we will record a one-time non-cash after-tax charge
directly to shareholders&#146; equity of approximately $35.0&nbsp;million to $55.0&nbsp;million, representing the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, in the first quarter of 2010. The cumulative
effect will consist primarily of the reestablishment of notes receivable (net of reserves)
associated with those securitization transactions, the elimination of residual interests that we
initially recorded in connection with those transactions, the impact of recording debt obligations
associated with third party interests held in the special purpose entities and related adjustments

standards will have the following impacts on our balance sheet: (1)&nbsp;assets will increase by
approximately $335.0&nbsp;million to $345.0&nbsp;million primarily related to the consolidation of notes
receivable; (2)&nbsp;liabilities will increase by approximately $380.0&nbsp;million to $390.0&nbsp;million,
primarily representing the consolidation of debt obligations associated with third party interests;
and (3)&nbsp;shareholders&#146; equity will decrease by approximately $35.0&nbsp;million to $55.0&nbsp;million. There
can be no assurances that this change in accounting principle will not adversely affect the market
value of our common stock or the assessment of our financial position by investors and lenders.</DIV>

In addition, certain state and local laws may impose liability on property developers with

<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Based on our experience at our resorts and at destination resorts owned by third parties, we
believe that resales of VOIs generally are made at net sales prices below their original customer
purchase prices. The relatively lower sales prices are partly attributable to the high marketing
and sales costs associated with the initial sales of such VOIs. Accordingly, the initial
purchase of a VOI may be less attractive to prospective buyers. Also, buyers who seek to resell
their VOIs compete with our efforts to sell our VOIs. While VOI resale clearing houses or
brokers currently do not have a material impact on our business, if a secondary market for VOIs
were to become more organized and
liquid, the resulting availability of resale VOIs at lower prices could adversely affect our
sales prices and the number of sales we can close, which in turn would adversely affect our
business and results of operations.</DIV>

during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, December&nbsp;31, 2008 and December&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively. As
part of its efforts to maintain regulatory capital ratios, BankAtlantic has reduced its assets and
repaid borrowings. However, the reduction of earning asset balances has resulted in reduced income
while at the same time BankAtlantic has experienced significant credit losses.

offerings, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. We could also pursue these financings
at the BankAtlantic Bancorp level or directly at BankAtlantic or both. Issuances of equity directly
at BankAtlantic would dilute BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s interest in BankAtlantic. During February
2010, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC pursuant to which we may issue up to $75

contribute additional capital to BankAtlantic will depend on its
ability to raise capital in the secondary markets and on its ability to liquidate its
portfolio of non-performing loans. The OTS has the right to impose additional capital requirements
on banks at its discretion and could impose additional capital requirements on BankAtlantic. Our
ability to raise additional capital will depend on, among other things, conditions in the financial
markets at the time, which are outside of our control, and our financial condition, results of
operations and prospects. The ongoing liquidity crisis and the loss of confidence in financial
institutions may make it more difficult or more costly to obtain financing. There is no assurance
that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. The terms and pricing of
any future transaction by BankAtlantic Bancorp or BankAtlantic could result in additional
substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and could adversely impact the price of our Class

anticipates that it will continue to defer this interest for the foreseeable future which could
adversely affect its financial condition and liquidity.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp began deferring interest on all of its $294&nbsp;million of junior
subordinated debentures as of March&nbsp;2009 which resulted in the deferral and accrual of $14.1
million of regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments that would otherwise have been paid
during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. The terms of the junior subordinated debentures allow
BankAtlantic Bancorp to defer interest payments for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods, and
BankAtlantic Bancorp anticipates that it will continue to defer such interest for the foreseeable
future. During the deferral period, interest continues to accrue on the junior subordinated
debentures, as well as on the deferred interest, at the relevant stated coupon rate, and at the end
of the deferral period BankAtlantic Bancorp will be required to pay all interest accrued during the
deferral period. In the event that BankAtlantic Bancorp elects to defer interest on its junior
subordinated debentures for the full 20 consecutive quarterly periods permitted under the terms of
the junior subordinated debentures, BankAtlantic Bancorp would owe approximately $72&nbsp;million of
accrued interest as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 (based on average interest rates applicable at December
31, 2009, which were at historically low interest rate levels). As most of the outstanding junior
subordinated debentures bear interest at rates that are indexed to LIBOR, if LIBOR rates increase
the interest that would accrue during the deferral period would be significantly higher and
likewise increase the amount BankAtlantic Bancorp would owe at the conclusion of the deferral
period.

statutory business trusts formed by BankAtlantic Bancorp may not be consummated.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During January&nbsp;2010, BankAtlantic Bancorp commenced cash offers to purchase all outstanding
trust preferred securities having an aggregate principal amount of approximately $285&nbsp;million at a
purchase price of $200 per $1,000 liquidation amount, or an aggregate of $57&nbsp;million. During
February&nbsp;2010, the cash offer with respect to the approximate $55&nbsp;million of publicly traded trust
preferred securities expired without any such trust preferred securities being repurchased, while
the expiration date for the offers relating to the remaining $230&nbsp;million of trust preferred
securities was extended until March&nbsp;22, 2010. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s ability to complete the offers
to purchase $230&nbsp;million of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s trust preferred securities is contingent upon
the completion of a financing transaction sufficient to pay the purchase price, and the receipt of
tenders and consents from Holders of the requisite amount of the relevant series of trusts
preferred securities. The structure of the ownership of the trust preferred securities (the
majority of which are held in pools with the securities of other issuers as collateral for
collateralized debt obligations) has made it very difficult to communicate with the beneficial
owners or negotiate the repurchase or modification of the terms of the outstanding securities.
Accordingly, there is no assurance that BankAtlantic Bancorp will be able to repurchase or redeem
any or a significant portion of the trust preferred securities. Further, as noted above,
BankAtlantic Bancorp has deferred making interest payments on the trust preferred securities and
BankAtlantic Bancorp financial condition would be adversely affected if interest payments on the
trust preferred securities were deferred for a prolonged period of time. While BankAtlantic
Bancorp anticipates that it will continue to defer interest payments for the foreseeable future, in
the event that BankAtlantic Bancorp completes offers to purchase for less than all of its series of
trust preferred securities, BankAtlantic Bancorp expects that it may cease the deferral of interest
on the series of trust preferred securities which will not be repurchased prior to completing the
repurchase of the other series and immediately thereafter once again commence the deferral of
interest with respect to all remaining series of trust preferred securities not repurchased. Any
issuance of our Class&nbsp;A common stock to raise funds to finance the purchase of any or all of
the trust preferred securities subject to these offers could be extremely dilutive to existing
shareholders.

affect, our earnings and financial condition.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continued deterioration of economic conditions in the Florida residential real estate
market, including the continued decline in median home prices year-over-year in all major
metropolitan areas in Florida, and the downturn in the Florida commercial real estate market,
resulted in a substantial increase in BankAtlantic&#146;s non-performing assets and provision for loan
losses over the past three years. The housing industry is in the midst of a substantial and
prolonged downturn reflecting, in part, decreased availability of mortgage financing for
residential home buyers, reduced demand for new construction resulting in a significant over-supply
of housing inventory and increased foreclosure rates. Additionally, the deteriorating condition of
the Florida economy and these adverse market conditions have negatively impacted the commercial
non-residential real estate market. BankAtlantic&#146;s earnings and financial condition were adversely
impacted over the past three years as the majority of its loans are secured by real estate in
Florida. We expect that our earnings and financial condition will continue to be unfavorably
impacted if market conditions do not improve or deteriorate further in Florida. At December&nbsp;31,
2009, BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolio included $263&nbsp;million of non-accrual loans concentrated in
Florida.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolio is concentrated in loans secured by real estate, a majority of which
are located in Florida, which makes us very susceptible to credit losses given the current
depressed real estate market.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditions in the United States real estate market have deteriorated significantly beginning
in 2007, particularly in Florida, BankAtlantic&#146;s primary lending area. BankAtlantic&#146;s loan
portfolio is concentrated in commercial real estate loans (most of which are located in Florida and
many of which involve residential land development), residential mortgages (nationwide), and
consumer home-equity loans (throughout BankAtlantic&#146;s markets in Florida). BankAtlantic has a
heightened exposure to credit losses that may arise from this concentration as a result of the
significant downturn in the Florida real estate markets. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic&#146;s loan
portfolio included $2.5&nbsp;billion of loans concentrated in Florida, which represented approximately
62% of its loan portfolio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that BankAtlantic&#146;s commercial residential loan portfolio has significant exposure
to further declines in the Florida residential real estate market. The &#147;Builder land bank loan&#148;
category held by BankAtlantic consists of 7 loans and aggregates $43.7&nbsp;million of which six loans
totaling $42.6&nbsp;million were on non-accrual as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. The &#147;Land acquisition and
development loan&#148; category held by BankAtlantic consists of 27 loans and aggregates $171.9&nbsp;million
of which ten loans totaling $60.2&nbsp;million were on non-accrual as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. The &#147;Land
acquisition, development and construction loan&#148; category held by BankAtlantic consists of 6 loans
and aggregates $11.3&nbsp;million of which one loan totaling $3.8&nbsp;million was on non-accrual as of
December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the loans described above, during 2008, the Company formed an asset workout
subsidiary which acquired non-performing commercial residential real estate loans from
BankAtlantic. The balance of these non-performing loans as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 was $39.4&nbsp;million
with $14.1&nbsp;million, $10.4&nbsp;million and $14.9
million of &#147;builder land bank loans&#148;, &#147;land acquisition and development loans&#148;, and &#147;land
acquisition, development and construction loans&#148;, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market conditions have and may in the future result in our commercial real estate borrowers
having difficulty selling lots or homes in their developments for an extended period, which in turn
could result in an increase in residential construction loan delinquencies and non-accrual
balances. Additionally, if the current depressed economic environment continues or deteriorates
further, collateral values may decline further which likely would result in increased credit losses
in these loans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in the commercial and construction and development real estate loans are
approximately $638.4&nbsp;million of commercial non-residential and commercial land loans. A borrower&#146;s
ability to repay these loans is dependent upon additional leasing through the life of the loan or
the borrower&#146;s successful operation of a business. Weak economic conditions may impair a borrower&#146;s
business operations and typically slow the execution of new leases. Such economic conditions may
also lead to existing lease turnover. As a result of these factors, vacancy rates for retail,
office and industrial space are expected to continue to rise in 2010. Increased vacancies could
result in rents falling further over the next several quarters. The combination of these factors
could result in further deterioration in real estate market conditions and BankAtlantic may
recognize higher credit losses on these loans, which would adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s commercial real estate loan portfolio includes 16 large lending relationships
totaling $429.0&nbsp;million, including relationships with unaffiliated borrowers involving lending
commitments in each case in excess of $20&nbsp;million. Defaults by any of these borrowers could have a
material adverse effect on BankAtlantic&#146;s results.

Florida properties primarily located in the markets where BankAtlantic operates its store network.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in residential real estate prices and higher unemployment throughout Florida has
resulted in an increase in mortgage delinquencies and higher foreclosure rates. Additionally, in
response to the turmoil in the credit markets, financial institutions have tightened underwriting
standards which has limited borrowers&#146; ability to refinance. These conditions have adversely
impacted delinquencies and credit loss trends in BankAtlantic&#146;s home equity loan portfolio and it
does not currently appear that these conditions will improve in the near term. Approximately 76%
of the loans in BankAtlantic&#146;s home equity portfolio are residential second mortgages and
BankAtlantic experienced higher delinquencies and credit losses in this portfolio during 2009. If
current economic conditions do not improve and home prices continue to fall, BankAtlantic may
continue to experience higher credit losses from this loan portfolio. Since the collateral for
this portfolio consists primarily of second mortgages, it is unlikely that BankAtlantic will be
successful in recovering all or any portion of its loan proceeds in the event of a default unless
BankAtlantic is prepared to repay the first mortgage and such repayment and the costs associated
with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a lender, BankAtlantic is exposed to the risk that its customers will be unable to repay
their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans
will not be sufficient to assure full repayment. BankAtlantic&#146;s management evaluates the
collectability of BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolio and provides an allowance for loan losses that it

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these factors are difficult to predict or estimate accurately, particularly in a
changing economic environment. The process of determining the estimated losses inherent in
BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolio requires subjective and complex judgments and the level of
uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect BankAtlantic&#146;s ability to estimate
the losses which may be incurred in its loan portfolio. If BankAtlantic&#146;s evaluation is incorrect
and borrower defaults cause losses exceeding the portion of the allowance for loan losses allocated
to those loans or if BankAtlantic perceives adverse trends that require it to significantly
increase its allowance for loan losses in the future, our earnings could be significantly and
adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increases in the allowance for loan losses with respect to the loans held by our asset workout
subsidiary, or losses in that portfolio which exceed the current allowance assigned to that
portfolio, would similarly adversely affect us.

adversely impact our results and future growth.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s business, the location of its stores, the primary source of repayment for its
small business loans and the real estate collateralizing its commercial real estate loans (and the
loans held by BankAtlantic Bancorp asset workout subsidiary) and its home equity loans are
primarily concentrated in Florida. As a result, BankAtlantic Bancorp is exposed to geographic
risks as increasing unemployment, declines in the housing industry and declines in the real estate
market are more severe in Florida than in the rest of the country. Adverse changes in laws and
regulations in Florida would have a greater negative impact on our revenues, financial condition
and business than on similar institutions in markets outside of Florida. Further, the State of
Florida is subject to the risks of natural disasters such as tropical storms and hurricanes, which
may disrupt our operations, adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to timely repay their
loans and the value of any collateral held by us or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results
of operations. The severity and impact of tropical storms, hurricanes and other weather related
events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>BankAtlantic&#146;s interest-only residential loans expose it to greater credit risks.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately $776&nbsp;million of BankAtlantic&#146;s purchased residential loan portfolio consists of
interest-only loans which represent approximately 50% of the total purchased residential loan
portfolio. While these loans are not considered sub-prime or negative amortizing loans, they are
loans with reduced initial loan payments with the potential for significant increases in monthly
loan payments in subsequent periods, even if interest rates do not rise, as required amortization
of the principal commences. Monthly loan payments will also increase as interest rates increase.
This presents a potential repayment risk if the borrower is unable to meet the higher debt service
obligations or refinance the loan. As previously noted, current economic conditions in the
residential real estate markets and the mortgage finance markets have made it more difficult for
borrowers to refinance their mortgages which also increase our exposure to loss.

operations and financial condition, and could result in further losses in the future.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s consolidated nonperforming loans totaled
$331&nbsp;million and $287.4&nbsp;million, or 8.96% and 6.65% of its loan portfolio, respectively. At
December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s consolidated nonperforming assets (which include
nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate) were $379.7&nbsp;million and $307.9&nbsp;million, or 7.88%
and 5.30% of our total assets, respectively. In addition, the Company had, on a consolidated basis,
approximately $72.9&nbsp;million and $95.3&nbsp;million in accruing loans that were 30-89&nbsp;days delinquent at
December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s consolidated nonperforming assets
adversely affect our net income in various ways. Until economic and real estate market conditions
improve, particularly in Florida but also nationally, we expect to continue to incur additional
losses relating to an increase in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets. BankAtlantic
Bancorp does not record interest income on nonperforming loans or real estate owned. When
BankAtlantic Bancorp receives the collateral in
foreclosures or similar proceedings, BankAtlantic Bancorp is required to mark the related
collateral to the then fair market value, generally based on appraisals of the property obtained by
us which often results in an additional loss. These loans and real estate owned also increase our
risk profile, and increases in the level of nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets could
impact our regulators&#146; view of appropriate capital levels in light of such risks. While
BankAtlantic Bancorp seeks to manage its problem assets through loan sales, workouts,
restructurings and other alternatives, decreases in the value of these assets, or the underlying
collateral, or in these borrowers&#146; performance or financial conditions, which is often impacted by
economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires
significant commitments of time from management, which can be detrimental to the performance of
their other responsibilities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of BankAtlantic&#146;s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, the
earnings and growth of BankAtlantic are significantly affected by interest rates, which are subject
to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign, events in the capital

particularly the Federal Reserve Board. The nature and timing of any changes in such policies or

particular, changes in market interest rates, changes in the relationships between short-term and
long-term market interest rates, or the yield curve, or changes in the relationships between
different interest rate indices can affect the interest rates charged on interest-earning assets
differently than the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. This difference could
result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income and therefore reduce
BankAtlantic&#146;s net interest income. While BankAtlantic has attempted to structure its asset and
liability management strategies to mitigate the impact on net interest income of changes in market
interest rates, there is no assurance that BankAtlantic will be successful in doing so.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s operating expenses have declined from $313.9&nbsp;million for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007 to $258.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. BankAtlantic reorganized
its operations during this period and significantly reduced operating expenses while focusing on
its core businesses and seeking to maintain quality customer service. While management is focused
on reducing overall expenses, there is no assurance that BankAtlantic will be successful in efforts
to further reduce expenses or that the current expense reductions can be maintained in the current
environment. BankAtlantic&#146;s inability to reduce or maintain its current expense structure may have
an adverse impact on our results.

expenses.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s FDIC deposit insurance expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 was $11.0
million, including a $2.4&nbsp;million special assessment. In September&nbsp;2009, the FDIC issued a rule
requiring institutions to prepay their insurance premiums for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012, and
increased annual insurance rates uniformly by three basis points in 2011. BankAtlantic&#146;s prepaid
insurance assessment was $31.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009. If the economy worsens and the number
of bank failures significantly increase or if the FDIC otherwise determines that action is
necessary, BankAtlantic may be required to pay additional FDIC specific assessments or incur
increased annual insurance rates which would increase our expenses and adversely impact our
results.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic has reduced its assets and repaid borrowings in order to improve its liquidity
and regulatory capital ratios. The reduction of earning asset balances has reduced our net
interest income. BankAtlantic Bancorp consolidated net interest income was $193.6&nbsp;million for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and $163.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. The
reduction in net interest income from earning asset reductions has previously been offset by lower
operating expenses in prior periods. BankAtlantic Bancorp abilities to further
reduce expenses without adversely affecting our operations may be limited and as a result further
reductions in BankAtlantic Bancorp consolidated earning asset balances in future periods, may
adversely affect earnings and/or operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely
impacted as a result of the downturn in the U.S. housing market and general economic conditions.
Dramatic declines in the national and, in particular, Florida housing markets over the past three
years, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, have negatively
impacted the credit performance of our loans and resulted in significant asset impairments at all
financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities, major commercial and investment
banks, and regional and community financial institutions including BankAtlantic. Reflecting concern
about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many
lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers,
including to other financial institutions. This market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to
an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased
market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally. The continuing economic
pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has adversely affected and
may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Further negative market and economic developments may cause adverse changes in payment patterns,
causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which may impact our charge-offs and
provisions for loan losses. Continuing economic deterioration that affects household and/or
corporate incomes could also result in reduced demand for credit or fee-based products and
services. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these
difficult market conditions on BankAtlantic and others in the financial services industry. In
particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, recent events in the financial services industry and, more generally, in the
financial markets and the economy, have led to various proposals for changes in the regulation of
the financial services industry. Earlier in 2009, legislation proposing significant structural
reforms to the financial services industry was introduced in the U.S. Congress. Among other things,
the legislation proposes the establishment of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency, which would
have broad authority to regulate providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial
products and services. Additional legislative proposals call for heightened scrutiny and regulation
of any financial firm whose combination of size, leverage, and interconnectedness could, if it
failed, pose a threat to the country&#146;s financial stability, including the power to restrict the
activities of such firms and even require the break-up of such firms at the behest of the relevant
regulator. New rules have also been proposed for the securitization market, including requiring
sponsors of securitizations to retain a material economic interest in the credit risk associated
with the underlying securitization.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all financial institutions, BankAtlantic&#146;s assets are primarily funded through its
customer deposits and changes in interest rates, availability of alternative investment
opportunities, a loss of confidence in financial institutions in general or BankAtlantic in
particular, and other factors may make deposit gathering more difficult. If BankAtlantic
experiences decreases in deposit levels, it may need to increase its borrowings or liquidate a
portion of its assets which may not be readily saleable. Additionally, interest rate changes or
further disruptions in the capital markets may make the terms of borrowings and deposits less
favorable. For a further discussion on liquidity, refer to &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic is exposed to the risk that its borrowers or counter-parties may default on their
obligations. Credit risk arises through the extension of loans, certain securities, letters of
credit, and financial guarantees and through counter-party exposure on trading and wholesale loan
transactions. In an attempt to manage this risk, we seek to establish policies and procedures to
manage both on and off-balance sheet (primarily loan commitments) credit risk.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic reviews the creditworthiness of individual borrowers or counter-parties, and
limits are established for the total credit exposure to any one borrower or counter-party, however,
such limits may not have the effect of adequately limiting credit exposure. In addition, when
deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and
counterparties, we often rely on information furnished to us by such customers and counterparties,
including financial statements and other financial information, and representations of the
customers and counterparties that relates to the accuracy and completeness of the information.
While we take all actions we deem necessary to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to
us, there is no assurance that all information provided to us will be accurate or that we will
successfully identify all information needed to fully assess the risk which may expose us to
increased credit risk and counterparty risk.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic also enters into participation agreements with or acquires participation
interests from other lenders to limit its credit risk, but will continue to be subject to risks
with respect to its interest in the loan, as well as not being in a position to make independent
determinations with respect to its interest. Further, the majority of BankAtlantic&#146;s residential
loans are serviced by others. The servicing agreements may restrict BankAtlantic&#146;s ability to
initiate work-out and modification arrangements with borrowers which could adversely impact
BankAtlantic&#146;s ability to minimize losses on non-performing loans.

Officer, and John E. Abdo, our Vice Chairman, beneficially own shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B
common stock representing approximately 71.6% of BFC&#146;s total voting power. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A common stock and Class&nbsp;B common stock vote as a single group on most matters. Accordingly,
BFC, directly, and Messrs.&nbsp;Levan and Abdo, indirectly through BFC, are in a position to control

aggregate voting power of all of BankAtlantic Bancorp common stock and BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;B
common stock possessing a fixed 47% of such aggregate voting power. BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;B
common stock currently represents approximately 2% of our common equity and 47% of the total voting
power. As a result, the voting power of BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;B common stock does not bear a
direct relationship to the economic interest represented by the shares. Any issuance of shares of
BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;A common stock will further dilute the relative economic interest of
BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;B common stock, but will not decrease the voting power represented by
its Class&nbsp;B common stock. Further, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Restated Articles of Incorporation
provide that these relative voting percentages will remain fixed until such time as BFC and its
affiliates own less than 487,613 shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;B common stock, which is
approximately 50% of the number of shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;B common stock that BFC now
owns, even if additional shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;A common stock are issued. Therefore,
BFC may sell up to approximately 50% of its shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;B common stock
(after converting those shares to Class&nbsp;A common stock), and significantly reduce its economic
interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp, while still maintaining its voting power. If BFC were to take
this action, it would widen the disparity between the equity interest represented by BankAtlantic
Bancorp Class&nbsp;B common stock and its voting power. Any conversion of shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp
Class&nbsp;B common stock into shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;A common stock would further dilute
the voting interests of the holders of BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;A common stock.

delisting of its Class&nbsp;A common stock from the New York Stock Exchange.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange.
Like many other companies involved in the financial services industry, the trading price of
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock has experienced a substantial decline. A listed
company would be deemed to be below compliance with the continued listing standards of the New York
Stock Exchange if, among other things, the listed company&#146;s average closing price was less than
$1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading day period or the listed company&#146;s average market
capitalization was less than $15&nbsp;million over a consecutive 30 trading day period. As of February
25, 2010, the average market price of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock over the prior 30
trading day period was $1.41, and BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s average market capitalization over that
period was $69.3&nbsp;million. However, the market price of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock
is subject to significant volatility and there is no assurance that it will not decrease in the
future so as to cause BankAtlantic Bancorp not to comply with the New York Stock Exchange&#146;s
requirement for continued listing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If BankAtlantic Bancorp does not meet the requirements for continued listing, then
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. In
such case, BankAtlantic Bancorp would attempt to cause its Class&nbsp;A common stock to be eligible for
quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. However, in such event, the trading price of BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock would likely be adversely impacted, it may become more difficult for
the holders of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock to sell or purchase shares of
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, and it may become more difficult for BankAtlantic
Bancorp to raise capital, which could materially and adversely impact our business, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations.

Service Corporation (&#147;BFC Shared Service&#148;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC, entered into office
lease agreements with BankAtlantic for office space in BankAtlantic&#146;s corporate headquarters which

Woodbridge pursuant to which Woodbridge leases from BFC office space in BankAtlantic&#146;s corporate
headquarters.

lease which expired in March&nbsp;2010. The tenant has opted not to renew the lease and has vacated the
space. We will continue to seek to sell the building or lease the vacant space available at this
office building to third parties, including to affiliates. In addition to
Woodbridge&#146;s properties used for offices, we additionally own commercial space in Florida that is
leased to third parties. Because of the nature of Woodbridge&#146;s real estate operations, significant

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Florida law, holders of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock who did not vote to approve
the merger and properly asserted and exercised their appraisal rights with respect to their shares
(&#147;Dissenting Holders&#148;) are entitled to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the fair value
of their shares (as determined in accordance with the provisions of Florida law) in lieu of the
shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock which they would otherwise have been entitled to receive.
Dissenting Holders, who owned in the aggregate approximately 4.6&nbsp;million shares of Woodbridge&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, provided written notice to Woodbridge regarding their intent to exercise
their appraisal rights. In accordance with Florida law, Woodbridge provided written notices to the
Dissenting Holders setting forth, among other things, its determination that the fair value of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock immediately prior to the effectiveness of the merger was $1.10
per share. As of the date of this filing, one Dissenting Holder which held approximately 400,000
shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock had withdrawn its shares from the appraisal rights
process, while the remaining Dissenting Holders, who collectively held approximately 4.2&nbsp;million
shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, have rejected Woodbridge&#146;s offer of $1.10 per share
and requested payment for their shares based on their respective fair value estimates of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. Woodbridge is currently in litigation in connection with the
Dissenting Holders appraisal process. In December&nbsp;2009, a $4.6&nbsp;million liability was recorded with
a corresponding reduction to additional paid-in capital which is reflected in our consolidated
financial statements representing in the aggregate Woodbridge&#146;s offer to the Dissenting Holders.
There is no assurance as to the amount of the cash payment that will be required to be made to the
Dissenting Holders, which amount may exceed the $4.6&nbsp;million that we have accrued related to this
matter.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;9, 2007, Levitt and Sons and the Debtors (&#147;the Debtors&#148;) filed voluntary petitions
for relief under the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases in the Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors commenced the Chapter
11 Cases in order to preserve the value of their assets and to facilitate an orderly wind-down of
their businesses and disposition of their assets in a manner intended to maximize the recoveries of
all constituents. On November&nbsp;27, 2007, the Office of the United States Trustee (the &#147;U.S.
Trustee), appointed an official committee of unsecured creditors in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases (the
&#147;Creditors&#146; Committee&#148;). On January&nbsp;22, 2008, the U.S. Trustee appointed a <I>Joint Home Purchase
Deposit Creditors Committee of Creditors Holding Unsecured Claims </I>(the &#147;Deposit Holders Committee&#148;,
and together with the Creditors Committee, the &#147;Committees&#148;) The Committees have a right to
appear and be heard in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008, the Debtors asserted certain claims against Woodbridge, including an entitlement to a
portion of the $29.7&nbsp;million federal tax refund which Woodbridge received as a consequence of
losses incurred at Levitt and Sons in prior periods. However, on June&nbsp;27, 2008, Woodbridge entered
into a settlement agreement (the &#147;Settlement Agreement&#148;) with the Debtors and the Joint Committee
of Unsecured Creditors (the &#147;Joint Committee&#148;) appointed in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. Pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement, among other things, (i)&nbsp;Woodbridge agreed to pay to the Debtors&#146; bankruptcy
estates the sum of $12.5&nbsp;million plus accrued interest from May&nbsp;22, 2008 through the date of
payment, (ii)&nbsp;Woodbridge agreed to waive and release substantially all of the claims it had against
the Debtors, including its administrative expense claims through July&nbsp;2008, and (iii)&nbsp;the Debtors
(joined by the Joint Committee) agreed to waive and release any claims they had against Woodbridge
and its affiliates. After certain of Levitt and Sons&#146; creditors indicated that they objected to the
terms of the Settlement Agreement and stated a desire to pursue claims against Woodbridge,
Woodbridge, the Debtors and the Joint Committee entered into an
amendment to the Settlement Agreement, pursuant to which Woodbridge would, in lieu of the
$12.5&nbsp;million payment previously agreed to, pay $8&nbsp;million to the Debtors&#146; bankruptcy estates and
place $4.5&nbsp;million in a release fund to be disbursed to third party creditors in exchange for a
third party release and injunction. The amendment also provided for an additional $300,000 payment
by Woodbridge to a deposit holders fund. The Settlement Agreement, as amended, was subject to a
number of conditions, including the approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This litigation arises from a dispute regarding liability under two performance bonds issued
in connection with a plat issued by the City of Brooksville for a single family housing project
that was not commenced and was abandoned prior to the bankruptcy of Levitt and Sons. Although the
property was deeded over to the lender as part of the bankruptcy, Levitt&#146;s parent company was a
guarantor on the bonds. The City of Brooksville contends that, notwithstanding that the single
family project was never commenced for which utilities were to be provided, it has a right to
collect the cash sum of the bonds in the amount of approximately $5.4&nbsp;million. Following Levitt and
Son&#146;s failure, Key Bank acquired the property and conveyed it to a buyer who negotiated a new
agreement eliminating any requirement for completing the planned utilities. Nonetheless, the City
continued to assert rights against the bonds. Woodbridge has fully secured the obligations of the
surety under the bonds and will be liable if the City&#146;s position is found to be correct.

Lesley et a1 v. Bluff Dale Development Corporation, Bluegreen Southwest One. L.P. et al.,</U> in
the 266th Judicial District Court, Erath County, Texas, the plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment
action against Southwest seeking to develop their reserved mineral interests in, on and under the
Mountain Lakes subdivision. The plaintiffs&#146; claims are based on property law, oil and gas law,
contract and tort theories. The property owners association and some of the individual landowners
have filed cross actions against Bluegreen, Southwest and individual directors of the property
owners association related to the mineral rights and certain amenities in the subdivision as
described below. On January&nbsp;17, 2007, the court ruled that the restrictions placed on the
development that prohibited oil and gas production and development were invalid and not enforceable
as a matter of law, that such restrictions did not prohibit the development of the plaintiffs&#146;
prior reserved mineral interests and that Southwest breached its duty to lease the minerals to
third parties for development. The court further ruled that Southwest was the sole holder of the
right to lease the minerals to third parties. The order granting the plaintiffs&#146; motion was
severed into a new cause styled Cause No.&nbsp;28769 <U>Betty Yvon Lesley et a1 v. Bluff Dale

Appeals, Eastland, Texas, the Appellate Court reversed the trial court&#146;s decision and ruled in
Southwest&#146;s favor and determined that all executive rights were owned by Southwest and then
transferred to the individual property owners in connection with the sales of land. All property
owner claims were decided in favor of Southwest. It was also decided that Southwest did not breach
a fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs as an executive rights holder. As a result of this decision, no
damages or attorneys&#146; fees are owed to the plaintiffs. On May&nbsp;14, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an
appeal with the Texas Supreme Court asking the Court to reverse the Appellate Court&#146;s decision in
favor of Bluegreen. No information is available as to when the Texas Supreme Court will render a

BankAtlantic, Case No.&nbsp;09-059341 (07), Circuit Court of the 17th Judicial Circuit for Broward
County, Florida.</I></B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;2, 2009, Joel and Elizabeth Rothman filed a purported class action against
BankAtlantic in Florida state court. The Complaint asserts claims for breach of contract, breach of
duty of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, conversion, and usury. Each of these counts
is related to BankAtlantic&#146;s collection of overdraft fees. The Complaint alleges that BankAtlantic
failed to adequately warn its customers about overdrafts, failed to give its customers the ability
to opt out of an automatic overdraft protection program and improperly manipulated debit card
transactions. The Plaintiffs seek to represent three classes of BankAtlantic customers in the State
of Florida who were assessed overdraft fees. BankAtlantic Bancorp believes the claims to be without
merit and intends to vigorously defend the action.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also parties to
lawsuits as plaintiff or defendant involving its bank operations, lending, tax certificates
activities and real estate activities. Additionally, from time to time, Bluegreen becomes involved
in disputes with existing and former employees, vendors, taxing jurisdictions and various other
parties. Although the Company believes it has meritorious defenses in the pending legal actions and
that the outcomes of these pending legal matters should not materially impact us, the ultimate
outcomes of these matters are uncertain.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are restrictions on the payment of dividends by BankAtlantic to BankAtlantic Bancorp and
in certain circumstances on the payment of dividends by BankAtlantic Bancorp to holders of its
common stock, including BFC. BankAtlantic Bancorp does not expect to receive dividend payments from
BankAtlantic, and BankAtlantic Bancorp is currently prohibited from paying dividends on its common
stock due to its decision to defer interest payments on its junior subordinated debentures. See
Financial Services Risk Factors and Financial Services &#151; Regulation and Supervision &#151; &#147;Limitation

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program which
authorizes the repurchase of up to 20,000,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock at an
aggregate cost of no more than $10&nbsp;million. The share repurchase program replaced our $10&nbsp;million
repurchase program that our Board of Directors approved in October&nbsp;2006 which placed a limitation
on the number of shares which could be repurchased under the program at 1,750,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock. In 2008, we repurchased 100,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock at an aggregate cost
of $54,000 under the prior program. The current program, like the prior program, authorizes
management, at its discretion, to repurchase shares from time to time subject to market conditions
and other factors. No shares were repurchased during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC Financial Corporation (&#147;BFC&#148; or, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise
requires, &#147;we&#148; &#147;us&#148; &#147;our&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a diversified holding company whose principal
holdings include a controlling interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries
(&#147;BankAtlantic Bancorp&#148;), a controlling interest in Bluegreen Corporation and its subsidiaries
(&#147;Bluegreen&#148;), a non-controlling interest in Benihana, Inc. (&#147;Benihana&#148;) and a controlling interest
in Core Communities, LLC (&#147;Core&#148; or &#147;Core Communities&#148;). As a result of our position as the
controlling shareholder of BankAtlantic Bancorp, we are a &#147;unitary savings bank holding company&#148;
regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;). As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, BFC and its
subsidiaries had total consolidated assets and liabilities of approximately $6.0&nbsp;billion and $5.6
billion, respectively (including the assets and liabilities of its consolidated subsidiaries,
noncontrolling interests of $158.9&nbsp;million) and BFC&#146;s shareholders&#146; equity of approximately $245.1
million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, BFC&#146;s business strategy has been to invest in and acquire businesses in diverse
industries either directly or through controlled subsidiaries. BFC believes that in the short term
that the Company&#146;s and shareholders&#146; interests are best served by providing strategic support for
its existing investments. In furtherance of this strategy, the Company took several steps in 2009
which it believes will enhance the Company&#146;s prospects. Key actions taken in 2009 included the
merger of BFC with Woodbridge Holdings; the purchase of an additional 7% interest in BankAtlantic
Bancorp, increasing our economic interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp to 37% and increasing our voting
interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp to 66%; and the purchase of an additional 23% interest in
Bluegreen increasing our ownership in Bluegreen to 52%. The acquisition of this control position in
Bluegreen resulted in a bargain purchase gain of approximately $183.1&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter
and net income attributable to BFC of $25.7&nbsp;million for the year. In addition, we took actions to
restructure Core in recognition of the continued depressed real estate market and its inability to
meet its obligations to its lenders. Over the longer term and as the economy improves, we may look
to increase our ownership in our affiliates or seek to make other opportunistic investments, with
no pre-determined parameters as to the industry or structure of the investment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a holding company with controlling positions in BankAtlantic Bancorp and Bluegreen,
generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) requires the consolidation of the financial
results of both entities. As a consequence, the assets and liabilities of both entities are
presented on a consolidated basis in BFC&#146;s financial statements. However, except as otherwise
noted, the debts and obligations of the consolidated entities, including Woodbridge, are not direct
obligations of BFC and are non-recourse to BFC. Similarly, the assets of those entities are not
available to BFC absent a dividend or distribution. The recognition by BFC of income from controlled entities is determined
based on the total percent of economic ownership in those entities. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, BFC owned
approximately 37% of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B common stock representing
approximately 66% of BankAtlantic Bancorp total voting power. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, we owned
approximately 52% of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following had significant financial impact on us during 2009:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>BFC and Woodbridge Merger </I></B><I>- </I>On September&nbsp;21, 2009, we consummated our merger with Woodbridge
Holdings Corporation pursuant to which Woodbridge Holdings Corporation merged with and into
Woodbridge Holdings, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary which continued as the surviving company of
the merger and the successor entity to Woodbridge Holdings Corporation. Pursuant to the terms of
the merger, which was approved by each company&#146;s shareholders at their respective meetings held on
September&nbsp;21, 2009, each outstanding share of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock (other than
Dissenting Holders, as defined below) automatically converted into the right to receive 3.47 shares
of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. Shares otherwise issuable to us attributable to the shares of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock owned by us were canceled in connection
with the merger. As a result of the merger, Woodbridge Holdings Corporation&#146;s separate corporate
existence ceased and its Class&nbsp;A Common Stock is no longer publicly traded. The merger resulted in
a net increase in BFC&#146;s shareholders&#146; equity of approximately $95.0&nbsp;million, an increase in common
stock and additional paid-in capital of approximately $303,000 and $94.7&nbsp;million, respectively, and
a corresponding decrease to noncontrolling interest of approximately $99.6&nbsp;million.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Florida law, holders of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock who did not vote to approve
the merger and properly asserted and exercised their appraisal rights with respect to their shares
(&#147;Dissenting Holders&#148;) are entitled to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the fair value
of their shares (as determined in accordance with the provisions of Florida law) in lieu of the
shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock which they would otherwise have been entitled to receive.
Dissenting Holders, who collectively held approximately 4.2&nbsp;million shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock, have rejected Woodbridge&#146;s offer of $1.10 per share and requested payment for their
shares based on their respective fair value estimates of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. In
connection with Woodbridge&#146;s offer to the Dissenting Holders, the Company accrued a $4.6&nbsp;million
liability with a corresponding decrease to additional paid-in capital, representing in the
aggregate Woodbridge&#146;s offer to the Dissenting Holders. Woodbridge is currently in litigation with
the Dissenting Holders, and the outcome of such litigation is uncertain. There is no assurance that
the actual payment required to be made to the Dissenting Holders will not exceed the amount
accrued. See Note 3 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for additional information
about the merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Acquisition
of Bluegreen shares </I></B><I>-</I> On November&nbsp;16, 2009, we purchased approximately 7.4&nbsp;million
additional shares of the common stock of Bluegreen for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
$23&nbsp;million. As a result of such share purchase, we increased our ownership interest in Bluegreen
from 29% of Bluegreen&#146;s outstanding common stock to approximately 52%. Accordingly, we now have a
controlling interest in Bluegreen and, under GAAP, Bluegreen&#146;s results are consolidated in our
financial statements since November&nbsp;16, 2009. Prior to
November&nbsp;16, 2009, the approximate 29% equity investment in Bluegreen was accounted under the
equity method. See Note 4 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; of this report for
additional information about the Bluegreen share acquisition on November&nbsp;16, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Acquisition
of BankAtlantic Bancorp shares </I></B><I>-</I> During the third quarter of 2009, BankAtlantic
Bancorp distributed to its shareholders 4.441 subscription rights for each share of its Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock held on August&nbsp;24, 2009. Each whole subscription right
entitled the holder to purchase one share of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock at a
purchase price of $2.00 per share. BFC exercised its subscription rights in the rights offering to
purchase an aggregate of 14.9&nbsp;million shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock for an
aggregate purchase price of $29.9&nbsp;million. This purchase increased BFC&#146;s ownership interest in
BankAtlantic Bancorp by approximately 7.3% to approximately 37.2% and increased BFC&#146;s voting
interest by approximately 6.7% to 66.0%. BFC&#146;s purchase of the 14.9&nbsp;million shares of BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock was accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with
recently adopted FASB authoritative guidance effective on January&nbsp;1, 2009, which provides that
changes in a parent&#146;s ownership interest which do not result in the parent losing its controlling
financial interest in its subsidiary are reported as equity transactions. Accordingly, BFC&#146;s
increase in BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s ownership interest resulted in an increase to additional paid-in
capital of approximately $7.0&nbsp;million, which represents the excess carrying value of the
noncontrolling interest acquired over the consideration paid.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Levitt and Sons Bankruptcy Settlement </I></B><I>- </I>On February&nbsp;20, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court entered an
order confirming a plan of liquidation jointly proposed by Levitt and Sons and the Official
Committee of Unsecured Creditors. That order also approved the settlement pursuant to the
settlement agreement that was entered into with the Joint Committee of Unsecured Creditors. No
appeal or rehearing of the Bankruptcy Court&#146;s order was filed by any party, and the settlement was
consummated on March&nbsp;3, 2009, at which time payment was made in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the settlement agreement. Under cost method accounting, the cost of settlement and
the related $52.9&nbsp;million liability (less $500,000 which was determined as the settlement holdback
and remained as an accrual pursuant to the settlement agreement) was recognized into income in the
first quarter of 2009, resulting in a $40.4&nbsp;million gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary.
Pursuant to the settlement agreement, we agreed to share a percentage of any tax refund
attributable to periods prior to the bankruptcy with the Debtors Estate. In the fourth quarter of
2009, we accrued approximately $10.7&nbsp;million in connection with the portion of the tax refund that
we will be required to pay to the Debtors Estate pursuant to the settlement agreement. As a result,
the gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 was $29.7
million. See Note 25 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for more information
regarding the tax refund.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reclassification
of Discontinued Operations - </I></B>In December&nbsp;2009, Core Communities reinitiated
efforts to sell two of its commercial leasing projects (&#147;the Projects&#148;) and began soliciting bids
from several potential buyers to purchase assets associated with the Projects. The assets are
available for immediate sale in their present condition and Core determined that it is probable
that it will sell the Projects in 2010. Due to this decision, the assets associated with the
Projects that are for sale have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods
presented in accordance with the accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets were reclassified as assets held for sale and the liabilities related to these
assets were reclassified as liabilities related to assets held for sale in the audited consolidated
statements of financial condition. Additionally, the results of operations for the projects were
reclassified to income from discontinued operations. Depreciation related to these assets held for
sale ceased in December&nbsp;2009. The Company has elected not to separate these assets in the audited
consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented. Management has reviewed the net
asset value and estimated the fair market value of the assets based on the bids received related to
these assets and determined that an impairment charge was necessary to write down the carrying
value of the Projects to their fair value less the costs to sell and, accordingly, recorded an
impairment charge of approximately $13.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. For a
discussion of negotiations with respect to the Projects, see &#147;Core&#146;s Liquidity and Capital
Resources&#148;.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company reported net income attributable to BFC of $25.7&nbsp;million in 2009 as compared to a
net loss attributable to BFC of $58.9&nbsp;million in 2008 and a net loss of $30.5&nbsp;million in 2007.
Results for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 included an $11.9&nbsp;million loss, $19.4
million of income and $8.8&nbsp;million of income from discontinued operations, net of income tax,
respectively. The results from discontinued operations related to financial results associated
with Ryan Beck and Core Communities commercial leasing projects, as discussed further in Note 5 of
the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148;. Real Estate and Other includes an approximately
$183.1&nbsp;million bargain purchase gain associated with Bluegreen&#146;s share acquisition on November&nbsp;16,
2009. See Note 4 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2009, the Company acquired additional shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;A Common Stock.
Effective on January&nbsp;1, 2009, the FASB adopted authoritative guidance which provides that changes
in a parent&#146;s ownership interest which do not result in the parent losing its controlling financial
interest in its subsidiary are reported as equity transactions. Accordingly, BFC&#146;s increase in its
ownership interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp resulted in an increase to additional paid-in capital of
approximately $7.0&nbsp;million, which represents the excess carrying value of the noncontrolling
interest acquired over the consideration paid.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008, the Company acquired additional shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
in the open market, and in 2007 the Company acquired shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock in
Woodbridge&#146;s
rights offerings to its shareholders, including the Company. The acquisition of these shares
resulted in negative goodwill (based on the excess of fair value of acquired net assets over the
purchase price of the shares) of approximately $19.6&nbsp;million in connection with the 2008
acquisition of shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp and $11&nbsp;million in connection with the 2007
acquisition of shares of Woodbridge. After ratably allocating this negative goodwill to
non-current and non-financial assets, the Company recognized in 2008 and 2007 an extraordinary
gain, net of tax, of $9.1&nbsp;million and $2.4&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Woodbridge merger on September&nbsp;21, 2009 and the Bluegreen share acquisition
on November&nbsp;16, 2009, in each case as described above, the Company reorganized its reportable
segments to better align its segment reporting with the current operations of its businesses. The
Company&#146;s business activities currently consist of (i)&nbsp;Real Estate and Other activities and (ii)
Financial Services activities, which are reported through six segments: BFC Activities, Real Estate
Operations, Bluegreen Resorts, Bluegreen Communities, BankAtlantic and BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent
Company. As a result of this reorganization, our BFC Activities segment now includes, in addition
to other activities historically included in the segment, Woodbridge Other Operations (which was
previously a segment). Our Real Estate Operations segment is now comprised of what was previously
identified as our Land Division, including the real estate business activities of Woodbridge and
its subsidiaries, Core Communities and Carolina Oak Homes, LLC (&#147;Carolina Oak&#148;). In 2007, the Real
Estate Operations segment also included the operations of Levitt and Sons, which was deconsolidated
as of November&nbsp;9, 2007 in connection with the filing of its Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases, and Levitt
Commercial.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Real Estate and Other business activities are reported in four segments which
are i) BFC Activities ii) Real Estate Operations, iii) Bluegreen Communities and iv) Bluegreen
Resorts. BFC&#146;s consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of Bluegreen
from November&nbsp;16, 2009 (when we acquired a controlling interest in Bluegreen) through December&nbsp;31,
2009. Accordingly, Bluegreen&#146;s results of operations since November&nbsp;16, 2009 are reported through
the Bluegreen Resorts and Bluegreen Communities segments. Prior to November&nbsp;16, 2009, when we owned
approximately 9.5&nbsp;million shares of Bluegreen common stock representing approximately 29% of such
stock, the investment in Bluegreen was accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In
prior years, the investment in Bluegreen was included in Woodbridge other operations, and our
interest in Bluegreen&#146;s earnings and losses prior to November&nbsp;16, 2009 are included in our BFC
Activities segment. The Company&#146;s Financial Services business activities include BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s results of operations and are reported in two segments: BankAtlantic and BankAtlantic
Bancorp Parent Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presentation and allocation of the assets, liabilities and results of operations of each
segment may not reflect the actual economic costs of the segment as a stand-alone business. If a
different basis of allocation were utilized, the relative contributions of the segments might
differ but, in management&#146;s view, the relative trends in segments would not likely be impacted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of our business segments and other information on each segment are discussed below
in BFC Activities, Real Estate Operations, Bluegreen Resorts, Bluegreen Communities, BankAtlantic
and BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company. See also Note 34 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements&#148; contained in Item&nbsp;8 of this report.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;7, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company designated 15,000 shares of the
Company&#146;s preferred stock as 5% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (&#147;5% Preferred Stock&#148;). On
June&nbsp;21, 2004, the Company sold all 15,000 shares of the Preferred Stock to an investor group in a
private offering.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5% Preferred Stock has a stated value of $1,000 per share. The shares of 5% Preferred
Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Company, from time to time, at redemption prices (the
&#147;Redemption Price&#148;) ranging from $1,025 per share for the year 2010 to $1,000 per share for the
year 2015 and thereafter. The 5% Preferred Stock liquidation preference is equal to its stated
value of $1,000 per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends or an amount equal to the
Redemption Price in a voluntary liquidation or winding up of the Company. Holders of the 5%
Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors,
cumulative quarterly cash dividends on each such share at a rate per annum of 5% of the stated
value from the date of issuance, payable quarterly. Since June&nbsp;2004, the Company has paid quarterly
dividends on the 5% Preferred Stock of $187,500. The 5% Preferred Stock has no voting rights except
as required by Florida law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;17, 2008, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation (the &#147;Amendment&#148;) to
change certain of the previously designated relative rights, preferences and limitations of the
Company&#146;s 5% Preferred Stock. The Amendment eliminated the right of the holders of the 5% Preferred
Stock to convert their shares of 5% Preferred Stock into shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock. The Amendment also requires the Company to redeem shares of the 5% Preferred Stock with the
net proceeds it receives in the event (i)&nbsp;the Company sells any of its shares of Benihana Series&nbsp;B
Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#147;Convertible Preferred Stock&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;the Company sells any shares
of Benihana&#146;s common stock received upon conversion of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock or
(iii)&nbsp;Benihana redeems any shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock owned by the Company.
Additionally, in the event the Company defaults on its obligation to make dividend payments on the
5% Preferred Stock, the Amendment entitles the holders of BFC&#146;s 5% Preferred Stock, to receive
directly from Benihana certain payments on the shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock
owned by the Company or on the shares of Benihana&#146;s common stock received by the Company upon
conversion of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2008, based on an analysis of the 5% Preferred Stock after giving effect to the
Amendment, the Company determined that the 5% Preferred Stock met the requirements to be
re-classified outside of permanent equity at its fair value at the Amendment date of approximately
$11.0&nbsp;million into the mezzanine category as Redeemable 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock. The
remaining amount of approximately $4.0&nbsp;million continues to be classified in Additional Paid in
Capital in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The fair value of the 5%
Preferred Stock was calculated by using an income approach by discounting estimated cash flows at a
market discount rate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Critical Accounting Policies</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management views critical accounting policies as accounting policies that are important to the
understanding of our financial statements and also involve estimates and judgments about inherently
uncertain matters. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial
condition and assumptions that affect the recognition of income and expenses on the consolidated
statement of operations for the periods presented. Actual results could differ significantly from
those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in
subsequent periods relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, evaluation of
goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, the valuation of real estate acquired in
connection with foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans, the valuation of real estate held for
development and sale and its impairment reserves, revenue and cost recognition on percent complete
projects, estimated costs to complete construction, the valuation of investments in unconsolidated
subsidiaries, the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities in the application of the
acquisition method of accounting, accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowance, accounting
for uncertain tax positions, accounting for contingencies, and assumptions used in the valuation of
stock based compensation. The accounting policies that we have identified as critical accounting
policies are: (i)&nbsp;allowance for loan losses and notes receivables; (ii)&nbsp;the valuation of retained
interests in notes receivable sold; (iii)&nbsp;impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets; (iv)
valuation of securities as well as the determination of other-than-temporary declines in value; (v)
accounting for business combinations; (vi)&nbsp;the valuation of real estate; (vii)&nbsp;revenue and cost
recognition on percent complete projects; (viii)&nbsp;estimated cost to complete construction; (ix)&nbsp;the
valuation of equity method investments; (x)&nbsp;accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowance;
and (xi)&nbsp;accounting for contingencies. See also Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; included in Item&nbsp;8 of this report for a
detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Business Combinations</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for its acquisitions in accordance with the accounting guidance for
business combinations. If the Company makes a &#147;bargain purchase&#148;, the Company recognizes a gain in
the income statement on the acquisition date. A bargain purchase is a business combination in which
the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed,
as measured in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations exceeds the
aggregate of (i)&nbsp;the consideration transferred, as measured in accordance with the accounting
guidance, which generally require acquisition date fair value; (ii)&nbsp;the fair value of any
non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and (iii)&nbsp;in a business combination achieved in stages,
the acquisition date fair value of the Company&#146;s previously held equity interest in the acquiree.
This allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions, including estimates of
future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets. The Company may utilize independent third
parties to assist the Company in assessing market conditions. The Company is also required to
periodically review these judgments and estimates and adjust them accordingly. If conditions change
from those expected, it is possible that the results could change in future periods. Certain
identifiable intangible assets, such as management contracts, are not amortized, but instead are
reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis, or if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the acquisition
cost allocation of Bluegreen has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on the
Company&#146;s operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Fair Value Measurements</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are required to disclose the fair value of our investments under accounting guidance for
fair value measurements. Based on this accounting guidance, fair value is the price that would be
received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). As such, fair value is a
market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, this
accounting guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair
value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by
requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. The three-tier fair value
hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining fair value, we are sometimes required to use various valuation techniques. When
valuation techniques other than those described as Level 1 are utilized, management must make
estimates and judgments in determining the fair value for its investments. The degree to which
management&#146;s estimates and judgments is required is generally dependent upon the market pricing
available for the investments, the availability of observable inputs, the frequency of trading in
the investments and the investment&#146;s complexity. If we make different judgments regarding
unobservable inputs, we could potentially reach different conclusions regarding the fair value of
our investments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Intangible Assets</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We evaluate our intangible assets when events and circumstances indicate that assets may be
impaired and when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less
than their carrying amounts. The carrying value of these assets is dependent upon estimates of
future earnings that they are expected to generate. If cash flows decrease significantly,
intangible assets may be impaired and would be written down to their fair value. The estimates of
useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future
periods that are subject to outside factors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intangible assets which consisted of management contracts in the amount of $63&nbsp;million
originated from the November&nbsp;16, 2009 acquisition of a controlling interest in Bluegreen. Such
management contracts, are not amortized, but instead are reviewed for impairment on at least an
annual basis, or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts
may not be recoverable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, we also held intangible assets of approximately $18.7&nbsp;million
and $24.2&nbsp;million, respectively, which are being amortized over the average life of the respective
assets, ranging from 7&nbsp;years to 10&nbsp;years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Revenue Recognition and Inventory Cost Allocation</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue and all related costs and expenses from house and land sales are recognized at the
time that closing has occurred, when title and possession of the property and the risks and rewards
of ownership transfer to the buyer, and when we do not have a substantial continuing involvement in
accordance with accounting guidance for sales of real estate. In order to properly match revenues
with expenses, we estimate construction and land development costs incurred and to be incurred, but
not paid at the time of closing. Estimated costs to complete are determined for each closed home
and land sale based upon historical data with respect to similar product types and geographical
areas and allocated to closings along with actual costs incurred based on a relative sales value
approach. To the extent the estimated costs to complete have significantly changed, we will adjust
cost of sales in the current period for the impact on cost of sales of previously sold homes and
land to ensure a consistent margin of sales is maintained.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue is recognized for certain land sales on the percentage-of-completion method when the
land sale takes place prior to all contracted work being completed. Pursuant to the requirements
of accounting guidance for sales of real estate, if the seller has a continuing involvement with
the property and does not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership, profit
is recognized based on the nature and extent of the seller&#146;s continuing involvement. In the case
of our land sales, this involvement typically consists of final development activities. We
recognize revenue and related costs as work progresses using the percentage-of-completion method,
which relies on estimates of total expected costs to complete required work. Revenue is recognized
in proportion to the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs at the
time of sale. Actual revenues and costs to complete construction in the future could differ from
our current estimates. If our estimates of development costs remaining to be completed are
significantly different from actual amounts, then our revenues, related cumulative profits and
costs of sales may be revised in the period that estimates change.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the requirements of the accounting guidance for real estate time-sharing
activities regarding vacation ownership interests (&#147;VOI&#148;) sales, Bluegreen recognizes revenue on
VOI and homesite sales when a minimum of 10% of the sales price has been received in cash (buyer&#146;s
commitment), the legal rescission period has expired, collectibility of the receivable representing
the remainder of the sales price is reasonably assured and Bluegreen has completed substantially
all of its obligations with respect to any development related to the real estate sold. Bluegreen
believes that it uses a reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectibility of the
receivables representing the remainder of the sales price of real estate sold. See the further
discussion of policies regarding the estimation of credit losses on Bluegreen&#146;s notes receivable
below. Should Bluegreen become unable to reasonably estimate the collectibility of its receivables,
the recognition of sales may have to be deferred and our results of operations could be negatively
impacted. Under timeshare accounting rules, the buyer&#146;s minimum cash down payment towards the
purchase of Bluegreen VOIs is met only if the cash down payment received, reduced by the value of
certain incentives provided to the buyer at the time of sale, is at least 10% of the sales price.
If, after consideration of the value of the incentive, the total down payment received from the
buyer is less than 10% of the sales price, the VOI sale, and the related cost of sales and direct
selling expenses, are deferred until such time that sufficient cash is received from the customer,
generally through receipt of mortgage payments. Changes to the quantity, type, or value of sales
incentives that Bluegreen provides to buyers of its VOIs may result in additional VOI sales being
deferred, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where all development has not been completed, Bluegreen recognizes revenue in
accordance with the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Should Bluegreen&#146;s estimates of
the total anticipated cost of completing Bluegreen Resorts&#146; or Bluegreen Communities&#146; projects
increase, Bluegreen may be required to defer a greater amount of revenue or may be required to
defer revenue for a longer period of time, which could materially adversely impact our results of
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timeshare accounting rules define a specific method of the relative sales value method for
relieving VOI inventory and recording cost of sales. Under the relative sales value method, cost
of sales is calculated as a percentage of net sales using a cost-of-sales percentage&#151;the ratio of
total estimated development cost to total estimated VOI revenue, including the estimated
incremental revenue from the resale of repossessed VOI inventory, generally as a result of the
default of the related receivable. For Communities real estate projects, costs are allocated to
individual homesites in the Communities&#146; projects based on the relative estimated sales value of
each homesite without regards to defaults or repossessed inventory. Under this method, the
allocated cost of a homesite is relieved from inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon
recognition of the related sale. Should Bluegreen&#146;s estimates of the sales values of its VOI and
homesite inventories differ materially from their ultimate selling prices, our gross profit could
be adversely impacted. Bluegreen&#146;s completed timeshare and homesite inventory is carried at the
lower of cost or market.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Allowance for Loan Losses on VOI Notes Receivables</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen estimates uncollectible VOI notes receivable based on historical uncollectibles for
similar VOI notes receivable over the applicable historical period. Bluegreen uses a static pool
analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each year&#146;s sales over the entire life of those notes.
Bluegreen also considers whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current
economic conditions. Additionally, under timeshare accounting requirements, no consideration is
given for future recoveries of defaulted inventory in the estimate of uncollectible VOI notes
receivable. If defaults increase, our results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Transfers of Financial Assets and Valuation of Retained Interests</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bluegreen transfers financial assets to third parties, such as when it sells VOI notes
receivable pursuant to its vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities, Bluegreen evaluates
whether or not such transfer should be accounted for as a sale pursuant to accounting rules in
place at the time of the transaction. The evaluation of sale treatment involves legal assessments
of the transactions, which includes determining whether the transferred assets have been isolated
from Bluegreen (i.e., put presumptively beyond Bluegreen&#146;s reach or the reach of Bluegreen&#146;s
creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership), determining whether each transferee has the
right to pledge or exchange the assets it received, and ensuring that Bluegreen does not maintain
effective control over the transferred assets through either (1)&nbsp;an agreement that both entitles
and obligates Bluegreen to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity or (2)&nbsp;the ability to
unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets (other than
through a cleanup call). Bluegreen believes that it has obtained appropriate legal opinions
and other guidance deemed necessary to properly account for its transfers of financial assets as
sales. As indicated below in &#147;Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted&#148;, should Bluegreen
be successful in selling additional notes receivable in the future, such transactions will be
evaluated under new rules which become effective on January&nbsp;1, 2010. Accordingly, Bluegreen does
not expect to recognize any future gains on the sale of notes receivable.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the sales of notes receivable referred to above, Bluegreen retains
subordinated tranches and rights to excess interest spread, which are retained interests in the
notes receivable sold. Gain or loss on the sale of the notes receivable has depended in part on the
allocation of the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer between
the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of
transfer. Bluegreen initially and periodically estimates the fair value of its retained interest in
notes receivable sold based on the present value of future expected cash flows using management&#146;s
best estimates of the key assumptions &#151; prepayment rates, loss severity rates, default rates and
discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. Should Bluegreen&#146;s estimates of these key
assumptions change or should the portfolios sold fail to satisfy specified performance criteria and
therefore trigger provisions whereby outside investors in the portfolios are paid on an accelerated
basis, there could be a reduction in the fair value of the retained interests and Bluegreen results
of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Allowance for loan losses</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount that BankAtlantic Bancorp believes
to be a reasonable estimate of probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio. BankAtlantic
Bancorp has developed policies and procedures for evaluating its allowance for loan losses which
considers all information available to BankAtlantic Bancorp. However, BankAtlantic Bancorp relies
on estimates and judgments regarding issues where the outcome is unknown. As a consequence, if
circumstances differ from its estimates and judgments, the allowance for loan losses may decrease
or increase significantly.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calculation of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s allowance for loan losses consists of two
components. The first component requires identifying impaired loans based on BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s management classification and, if necessary, assigning a valuation allowance to the
impaired loans. Valuation allowances are established using BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s management
estimates of the fair value of collateral or based on valuation models that present value
estimated expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate. These
valuations are based on available information and require estimates and subjective judgments about
fair values of the collateral or expected future cash flows. Most of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s loans
do not have an observable market price, and an estimate of the collection of contractual cash
flows is based on the judgment of management. It is likely that materially different results would
be obtained if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. As a consequence of the
estimates and assumptions required to calculate the first component of the allowance for loan
losses, a change in these highly uncertain estimates could have a materially favorable or
unfavorable impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second component of the allowance for loan losses requires BankAtlantic Bancorp to group
loans that have similar credit risk characteristics so as to form a basis for estimating probable
losses inherent in the group of loans based on historical loss percentages and delinquency trends
as it relates to the group. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s management assigns a quantitative allowance to
these groups of loans by utilizing historical loss experiences. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s management
uses its judgment to determine the length of the time used in the historical loss experience.
During each of the years in the two year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, management used a 2&nbsp;year
loss experience to calculate the loss experience. However, due to the rapid decline in economic
conditions and real estate values, during 2009, management shortened its historical loss
experience by portfolio to between six months and one year, in order to reflect the current
heighted loss experience in the quantitative allowance. The historical loss period is selected
based on management&#146;s judgment and a change in this loss period may result in material changes to
the quantitative loss allowance. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s management also assigns a qualitative
allowance to these groups of loans in order to adjust the historical data, if necessary, for
qualitative factors that exist currently that were not present in the historical data. These
qualitative factors include delinquency trends, actual loan classification migration trends,
economic and business conditions, concentration of credit risk, loan-to-value ratios, problem loan
trends and external factors. In deriving the qualitative allowance BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
management uses significant judgment to qualitatively adjust the historical loss experiences for
current trends that existed at period end that were not reflected in the calculated historical
loss ratios and to adjust the allowance for the
changes in the current economic climate compared to the economic environment that existed
historically. A subsequent change in data trends or the external environment may result in
material changes in this component of the allowance from period to period.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management believes that the allowance for loan losses reflects a reasonable estimate of
incurred credit losses as of the statement of financial condition date. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009,
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s allowance for loan losses was $187.2&nbsp;million. See &#147;Provision for Loan
Losses&#148; for a discussion of the amounts of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s allowance assigned to each loan
product. The estimated allowance, which was derived from the above methodology, may be
significantly different from actual realized losses. Actual losses incurred in the future are
highly dependent upon future events, including the economies of geographic areas in which
BankAtlantic Bancorp holds loans, especially in Florida. These factors are beyond management&#146;s
control. Accordingly, there is no assurance that BankAtlantic Bancorp will not incur credit
losses in excess of the amounts estimated by its allowance for loan losses. In addition, various
regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review its
allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require BankAtlantic Bancorp to recognize additions
to the allowance based on its judgments and information available to them at the time of their
examination and such judgments may differ from management&#146;s judgment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp analyzes its loan portfolio quarterly by monitoring the loan mix, credit
quality, loan-to-value ratios, concentration by geographical area, vintage, historical trends and
economic conditions. As a consequence, the allowance for loan losses estimates will change from
period to period. During the three year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, real estate markets
experienced significant price increases accompanied by an abundance of available mortgage
financing. Additionally, based on historical loss experience during that time, BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s credit policies focused its loan production on collateral based loans and the
discontinuation of certain loan products. These factors, other internal metrics and external
market factors favorably impacted their provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses
during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. Conversely, during the three years ended December&nbsp;31,
2009, the residential real estate market and general economic conditions, both nationally and in
Florida, rapidly deteriorated with significant reductions in the sales prices and volume of
residential real estate sold, plummeting collateral values, dramatic increases in unemployment and
severe tightening of credit availability to borrowers. The impact of these rapidly deteriorating
real estate market conditions and adverse economic conditions on our loan portfolios resulted in a
significant increase in the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans from 0.94% at
December&nbsp;31, 2006 to 4.83% at December&nbsp;31, 2009. We believe that our earnings in subsequent
periods will be highly sensitive to changes in the Florida real estate market as well as the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We record our securities available for sale and derivative instruments in our statement of
financial condition at fair value. We also disclose fair value estimates in our statement of
financial condition for investment securities at cost. We generally use market and income
approach valuation techniques and a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in
valuation techniques. Our policy is to use quoted market prices (Level 1 inputs) when available.
However quoted market prices are not available for BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s mortgage-backed
securities, REMIC&#146;s, other securities and certain equity securities requiring BankAtlantic Bancorp
to use Level 2 and Level 3 inputs. The classification of assumptions as Level 2 or Level 3 inputs
is based on judgment and the classification of the inputs could change based on the availability
of observable market data.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp subscribes to a third-party service to assist it in determining the fair
value of their mortgage-backed securities and real estate mortgage conduits. The estimated fair
value of these securities at December&nbsp;31, 2009 was $319.3&nbsp;million. Matrix pricing are used to
value these securities as identical securities that they own are not traded on active markets.
Matrix pricing computes the fair value of mortgage-backed securities and real estate mortgage
conduits based on the coupon rate, maturity date and estimates of future prepayment rates obtained
from trades of securities with similar characteristic and from market data obtained from brokers.
BankAtlantic Bancorp considers the above inputs Level 2. Upon the sale of securities, BankAtlantic
Bancorp back-tests the values obtained from matrix pricing for reasonableness. The valuations
obtained from matrix pricing are not actual transactions and may not reflect the actual amount
that would be realized upon sale. While the interest
rate and prepayment assumptions used in matrix pricing are representative of assumptions that
BankAtlantic Bancorp believes market participants would use in valuing these securities, different
assumptions may result in significantly different results. Additionally, current observable data
may not be available in subsequent periods which would cause BankAtlantic Bancorp to utilize Level
3 inputs to value these securities. The mortgage-backed and REMIC securities that BankAtlantic
owns are government agency guaranteed with minimal credit risk. These securities are of high
credit quality and BankAtlantic believes could be liquidated in the near future; however, the
price obtained upon sale could be higher or lower than the fair value obtained through matrix
pricing. In light of the current volatility and uncertainty in credit markets, it is difficult to
estimate with accuracy the price that could be obtained for these securities and the time that it
could take to sell them in an orderly transaction.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We perform an evaluation on a quarterly basis to determine if any of our equity investments
and debt securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. In making this determination, we consider
the extent and duration of the impairment, the nature and financial condition of the issuer and our
ability and intent to hold securities for a period sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery
in market value. If an equity security is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we
record an impairment loss as a charge to income for the period in which the impairment loss is
determined to exist, resulting in a reduction to our earnings for that period. If a debt security
is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we record an impairment loss as a charge to
income if we intend to sell the securities before they recover or if we do not expect to recover
the securities historical cost due to credit loss. Management exercises significant judgment in
determining the amount of credit loss in an impairment which is generally based on the present
value of expected cash flows. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp had $22.1&nbsp;million of
impaired securities with an unrealized loss of $26,000 and $298.2&nbsp;million of securities that were
determined not to be impaired. However, in light of the current market uncertainties, and the
challenging economic and credit market conditions, there is no assurance that future events will
not cause us to have additional impaired securities in the foreseeable future.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We test goodwill for impairment annually or when events or circumstances occur that may result
in goodwill impairment during interim periods. On the BankAtlantic Bancorp level, the test requires
BankAtlantic Bancorp to determine the fair value of its reporting units and compare the reporting
units&#146; fair value to its carrying value. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s reporting units are comprised of
Community Banking, Commercial Lending, Tax Certificate Operations, Capital Services and Investment
Operations. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using discounted cash flow
present value valuation models and market multiple techniques.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While management of BankAtlantic Bancorp believes the sources utilized to arrive at the fair
value estimates are reliable, different sources or methods could have yielded different fair value
estimates. These fair value estimates require a significant amount of judgment. If the fair value
of a reporting unit is below the carrying amount, a second step of the goodwill impairment test is
performed. This second step requires BankAtlantic Bancorp to determine the fair value of all
assets (recognized and unrecognized) and liabilities in a manner similar to a business combination
purchase price allocation. Since there is no active market for many of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
assets, management derives the fair value of the majority of these assets using net present value
models. As a consequence, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s management estimates rely on assumptions and
judgments regarding issues where the outcome is unknown and, as a result, actual results or values
may differ significantly from these estimates. Additionally, declines in the market capitalization
of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s common stock affect the aggregate fair value of the reporting units.
Changes in management&#146;s valuation of BankAtlantic Bancorp reporting units and the underlying assets
as well as declines in BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s market capitalization may affect future earnings
through the recognition of additional goodwill impairment charges.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp recognized goodwill impairment
charges of $10.5&nbsp;million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009 our remaining goodwill was $12.2&nbsp;million.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the fair value of the reporting units, BankAtlantic Bancorp used a combination
of discounted cash flow techniques and market multiple methodologies. These methods utilize
assumptions for
expected cash flows, discount rates, and comparable financial institutions to determine market
multiples. The aggregate fair value of all reporting units derived from the above valuation
techniques was compared to BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s market capitalization adjusted for a control
premium in order to determine the reasonableness of the financial model output. A control premium
represents the value an investor would pay above minority interest transaction prices in order to
obtain a controlling interest in the subject company. The values separately derived from each
valuation technique (i.e., discounted cash flow and market multiples) were used to develop an
overall estimate of a reporting unit&#146;s fair value. Different weighting of the various fair value
techniques could result in a higher or lower fair value. Judgment is applied in determining the
weightings that are most representative of fair value. BankAtlantic Bancorp used financial
projections over a period of time, considered necessary to achieve a steady state of cash flows for
each reporting unit. The primary assumptions in the projections were anticipated loan and deposit
growth, interest rates and revenue growth. The discount rates were estimated based on the Capital
Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and
unsystematic risk and size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The
estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in the discount rate and
terminal value assumptions. Minor changes in these assumptions could impact significantly the fair
value assigned to a reporting unit. Future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the
estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below
its carrying value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value, goodwill may be
impaired, and the second step of the goodwill impairment evaluation is performed. The second step
involves calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill. The implied fair
value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as it is determined in a business combination.
The fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s assets and liabilities, including previously unrecognized
intangible assets, is individually determined. The excess fair value of the reporting unit over the
fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s net assets is the implied goodwill. Significant judgment and
estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting
unit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of the implied goodwill is highly sensitive to the estimated fair value of the
reporting unit&#146;s net assets. The fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s net assets is estimated using a
variety of valuation techniques including the following:

indicative of the current environment. If the implied fair value of the goodwill for the reporting
unit exceeds the carrying value of the goodwill for the respective reporting unit, no goodwill
impairment is recorded. Changes in the estimated fair value of the individual assets and
liabilities may result in a different amount of implied goodwill, and the amount of goodwill
impairment, if any. Future changes in the fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s net assets may result
in future goodwill impairment.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When testing a long-lived
asset for recoverability, it may be necessary to review estimated lives and adjust the depreciation
period. Changes in circumstances and the estimates of future cash flows, as well as evaluating
estimated lives of long-lived assets, are subjective and involve a significant amount of judgment.
A change in the estimated life of a long-lived asset may substantially change depreciation and
amortization expense in subsequent periods. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an
impairment loss, BankAtlantic Bancorp is required to group long-lived assets at the lowest level
for which identifiable cash flows are independent of other assets. These cash flows are based on
projections from management reports which are based on subjective interdepartmental allocations.
Real estate inventory and other long-lived real estate assets are evaluated for impairment on a
project-by-project basis. Fair values are not available for many of our long-lived assets, and
estimates must be based on available information, including prices of similar assets and
present value valuation techniques using Level 3 unobservable inputs. Long-lived assets subject to
the above impairment analysis included property and equipment, internal-use software, real estate
inventory and real estate owned.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We generally utilize broker price opinions, third party offers to purchase, discounted cash
flows or third party appraisals to assist us in determining the fair value of real estate
inventory, operating lease contracts and real estate owned. The appraiser or brokers use
professional judgment in determining the fair value of the properties and we may also adjust these
values for changes in market conditions subsequent to the valuation date when current appraisals
are not available. The assumptions used to calculate the fair values are generally Level 3 inputs
and are highly subjective and extremely sensitive to changes in market conditions. The amount
ultimately realized upon the sale of these properties or the termination of operating leases may be
significantly different than the recorded amounts. The assumptions used are representative of
assumptions that we believe market participants would use in fair valuing these assets or lease
contracts, but different assumptions may result in significantly different results. BankAtlantic
Bancorp also validates its assumptions by comparing completed transactions with its prior period
fair value estimates and may check its assumptions against multiple valuation sources. The
outstanding balance of real estate owned and real estate inventory was $46.5&nbsp;million and $494.6
million, respectively, as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. The minimum lease payments of operating lease
contracts executed for BankAtlantic&#146;s branch expansion were $23.4&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Accounting for Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company reviews the carrying amount of its deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if
the establishment of a valuation allowance is necessary. If, based on the available evidence, it
is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets will not be
realized, a deferred tax valuation allowance would be established. Consideration is given to all
positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In evaluating the available evidence, management considers historical financial performance,
expectation of future earnings, length of statutory carry forward periods, experience with
operating loss and tax credit carry forwards not expiring unused, tax planning strategies and
timing of reversals of temporary differences. Significant judgment is required in assessing future
earnings trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences. The Company&#146;s evaluation is
based on current tax laws as well as management&#146;s expectations of future performance based on its
strategic initiatives. Changes in existing tax laws and future results differing from expectations
may result in significant changes in the deferred tax assets valuation allowance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our evaluation as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, a net deferred tax asset valuation
allowance was established for the entire amount of the Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets as the
realization of these assets did not meet the more-likely-than-not criteria of the Accounting
Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;). During the fourth quarter of 2008, market conditions in the
financial services industry significantly deteriorated with the bankruptcies and government
bail-outs of large financial services entities. This market turmoil led to a tightening of credit,
lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction in business
activity. These economic conditions as well as the continued deterioration in local real estate
markets adversely effected BankAtlantic&#146;s profitable lines of business. As a consequence of the
worsening economic conditions during the fourth quarter of 2008, it appeared more-likely-than-not
that the Company would not realize its deferred tax assets resulting in a deferred tax asset
valuation allowance for the entire amount of the Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets. During the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company recognized significant losses and the economic conditions
did not improve, resulting in the Company maintaining its deferred tax valuation allowance for the
entire amount of its deferred tax asset. However, significant judgment is required in evaluating
the positive and negative evidence for the establishment of the deferred tax asset valuation
allowance, and if future events differ from expectations or if there are changes in the tax laws, a
substantial portion or the entire deferred tax asset benefit may be realized in the future. The
Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets can be carried forward for 20&nbsp;years and applied to offset future
taxable income. In November&nbsp;2009, net operating loss tax laws changed enabling the Company&#146;s
subsidiaries to recognize a benefit in the aggregate of approximately $66.3&nbsp;million associated with
the Company&#146;s 2009 taxable loss.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance for transfers of
financial assets, which became effective for us on January&nbsp;1, 2010. This amendment eliminates the
concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity (&#147;QSPE&#148;) and changes the requirements for
derecognizing financial assets. It also requires the disclosure of more information about transfers
of financial assets, including securitization transactions and transactions where companies have
continuing exposure to the risks related to the transferred financial assets. See discussion of the
amended guidance related to variable interest entities (&#147;VIEs&#148;) below, for the anticipated impact
of the adoption of this accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance for consolidation of
VIEs, which became effective for Bluegreen on January&nbsp;1, 2010. The initial adoption of this
amendment in the first quarter of 2010 will require Bluegreen to consolidate its existing
qualifying special purpose entities associated with past securitization transactions. As such, it
is expected that Bluegreen will record a one-time non-cash after-tax adjustment to shareholders&#146;
equity of approximately $35.0&nbsp;million to $55.0&nbsp;million, representing the cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle, in the first quarter of 2010. The cumulative effect will consist primarily
of the reestablishment of notes receivable (net of reserves) associated with those securitization
transactions, the elimination of residual interests that were initially recorded in connection with
those transactions, the impact of recording debt obligations associated with third party interests
held in the special purpose entities and related adjustments to deferred financing costs and
inventory balances. The Company anticipates that its adoption of these standards will have the
following impacts on its balance sheet: (1)&nbsp;assets will increase by approximately $380&nbsp;million to
$400&nbsp;million primarily related to the consolidation of notes receivable; (2)&nbsp;liabilities will
increase by approximately $390&nbsp;million to $410&nbsp;million, primarily representing the consolidation of
debt obligations associated with third party interests; (3)&nbsp;equity will decrease by
approximately $5&nbsp;million to $12&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Impact of Inflation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial statements and related financial data and notes presented herein have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the
measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without
considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the Company&#146;s and its subsidiaries&#146; assets
and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact
on our performance than the effects of general price levels. Although interest rates generally
move in the same direction as inflation, the magnitude of such changes varies. Inflation could
also have a long-term impact on us because any increase in the cost of land, materials and labor
would result in a need to increase the sales prices of land which may not be possible.
Furthermore, as it relates to Bluegreen, increases in Bluegreen&#146;s construction and development
costs would result in increases in the sales price of its VOIs. There is no assurance that
Bluegreen will be able to increase or maintain the current level of its sales prices or that
increased construction costs will not have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen&#146;s gross margin.
In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which could have a negative
impact on consumer demand and the costs of financing activities. Rising interest rates as well as
increased materials and labor costs may reduce margins.

<DIV align="right" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">&nbsp;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General and administrative expenses decreased $6.5&nbsp;million to $30.4&nbsp;million for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to $36.9&nbsp;million for 2008. The decrease was attributable to lower
professional services as we incurred costs associated with certain of our securities investments in
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 while these costs were not incurred in the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2009, and lower severance charges related to the reductions in workforce associated with the
bankruptcy filing of Levitt and Sons. In addition, we also had lower insurance costs, as Levitt
and Sons&#146; related insurance costs were not incurred after June&nbsp;30, 2008, and lower incentive
expenses. These decreases were offset in part by incurred franchise expenses related to Pizza
Fusion in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, compared to no franchise expenses in 2008 period as we
acquired Pizza Fusion in September&nbsp;2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest expense consists of interest incurred less interest capitalized. Interest incurred
totaled $7.4&nbsp;million and $8.6&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively,
while interest capitalized totaled $931,000 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $927,000 for
2008. This resulted in interest expense of $6.5&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009,
compared to $7.6&nbsp;million in 2008. The decrease in interest expense was mainly due to the repayment
of an intersegment loan in June&nbsp;2008, which resulted in lower interest expense in 2009, and lower
interest rates in 2009 compared to 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, we experienced a write-off in goodwill related to our
investment in Pizza Fusion in the amount of $2.0&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the consolidation of Bluegreen into our consolidated financial statements on November
16, 2009, we accounted for our investment in Bluegreen under the equity method of accounting. Our
interest in Bluegreen&#146;s earnings during the period from January 1 through November&nbsp;16, 2009 was
$32.7&nbsp;million (after the amortization of approximately $28.4&nbsp;million related to the change in the
basis as a result of the impairment charges on this investment during the quarters ended September
30, 2008, December&nbsp;31, 2008 and March&nbsp;31, 2009. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, our interest
in Bluegreen&#146;s earnings was $9.0&nbsp;million (after the amortization of approximately $9.2&nbsp;million
related to the change in the basis as a result of the impairment charge on this investment at
September&nbsp;30, 2008). We reviewed our investment in Bluegreen for impairment on a quarterly basis or
as events or circumstances warranted for other-than-temporary declines in value. Based on the
results of the evaluations of the investment in Bluegreen, other-than-temporary impairment charges
of approximately $31.2&nbsp;million and $94.4&nbsp;million were recorded during the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2009 and 2008, respectively. In the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, no other-than-temporary charges
related to the investment in Bluegreen were recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment gains were approximately $6.7&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared
to $2.1&nbsp;million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a gain related to the sale of our
shares in Office Depot during 2009. This was offset by a realized gain on the sale of publicly
traded equity securities in 2008 of approximately $796,000 by venture partnership that BFC
controls.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest income was approximately $1.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared
to $3.8&nbsp;million in 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower cash balances and lower
interest rates in 2009 compared to 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax benefit includes the amount of the expected refund from the Department of the
Treasury of approximately $34.6&nbsp;million. In November&nbsp;2009, the Workers, Homeownership, and Business
Assistance Act of 2009 (the &#147;Act&#148;) was enacted. The Act includes a provision that allows most
businesses to elect to increase the net operating loss (&#147;NOLs&#148;) carryback period from two years
under current law to as much as five years for NOLs generated in either 2008 or 2009 (but not
both). BFC anticipates that this election will benefit the Company by allowing it to carryback
Woodbridge&#146;s NOLs that were generated in 2008 and obtain refunds of taxes paid in the carryback
years.

$11.0&nbsp;million in the same 2007 period. Cost of sales of real estate was comprised of the expensing
of interest previously capitalized in 2008 and 2007 and also included in 2007 capitalized interest
impairment charges related to the cessation of development on certain Levitt and Sons&#146; projects in
the third quarter of 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General and administrative expenses decreased $8.9&nbsp;million to $36.9&nbsp;million for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared to $45.8&nbsp;million for the same 2007 period. The decrease was attributable
to decreased compensation and benefits expenses, decreased office related expenses and decreased
severance charges related to the reductions in workforce associated with the bankruptcy filing of
Levitt and Sons in 2007. The decrease in compensation, benefits and office related expenses was
attributable to lower headcount. These decreases were offset in part by increases in professional
fees associated with our securities investments and the bankruptcy filing of Levitt and Sons, and
increased insurance costs due to the absorption of certain of Levitt and Sons&#146; insurance costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest incurred totaled $8.6&nbsp;million and $10.2&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008
and 2007, respectively, while interest capitalized totaled $927,000 for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2008 and $9.3&nbsp;million for the same 2007 period. This resulted in interest expense of $7.6&nbsp;million
in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, compared to $903,000 in the same 2007 period. The increase in
interest expense was due to the completion of certain phases of development associated with our
real estate inventory late in 2007, which resulted in a decreased amount of assets which qualified
for interest capitalization and, therefore, the expensing of the related interest was only recorded
in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the full year of 2008. The increase in interest incurred
was attributable to higher average debt balances for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared to
2007, offset in part by lower average interest rates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not incur other expenses in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. Other expenses for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 were $2.4&nbsp;million and consisted of a surety bonds accrual and a
write-off of leasehold improvements. In 2007, we recorded $1.8&nbsp;million in surety bonds accrual
related to certain bonds where management considered it probable that reimbursement of the surety
under the applicable indemnity agreement would be required. In addition to the surety bond accrual,
we also recorded a write-off of leasehold improvements as we vacated certain leased space as part
of our workforce reductions and the Levitt and Sons bankruptcy. Leasehold improvements in the
amount of $564,000 related to this vacated space will not be recovered and were written off in the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen reported a net loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 of $516,000, compared to
net income of $31.9&nbsp;million in 2007. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, our interest in
Bluegreen&#146;s earnings was $9.0&nbsp;million (after the amortization of approximately $9.2&nbsp;million related
to the change in the basis as a result of the impairment charge on this investment at September&nbsp;30,
2008), compared to $10.3&nbsp;million in 2007. We reviewed our investment in Bluegreen for impairment on
a quarterly basis or as events or circumstances warranted for other-than-temporary declines in
value. Based on the evaluations performed, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge
of $53.6&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2008 and an additional other-than-temporary impairment charge of
$40.8&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008. See Note 14 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisitions in 2008 and 2007 of additional shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s and
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, respectively, were accounted for as step acquisitions under the
purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities acquired have been revalued
to reflect market values at the respective dates of acquisition. For further information see Note 4
of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148;. The discounts and premiums arising as a result
of such revaluations are generally being accreted or amortized, net of tax, over the remaining life
of the assets and liabilities. The net impact of such accretion, amortization and other effects of
purchase accounting increased our consolidated net loss during 2009 by approximately $5.9&nbsp;million,
comprised primarily of an approximately $8.9&nbsp;million purchase accounting associated with Core&#146;s
real estate impairment, partially offset by the effect of purchase accounting associated with
property and equipment of approximately $1.2&nbsp;million, loans receivable of approximately $2.2
million and goodwill of approximately $583,000. In 2008, the net impact of purchase accounting
decreased our consolidated net loss by approximately $8.4&nbsp;million, of which approximately $4.7
million and $1.7&nbsp;million was due to effects of purchase accounting associated with the investment
in Bluegreen and goodwill, respectively. There were no purchase accounting adjustments in 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, we had cash, cash equivalents and a short term investment in
certificates of deposit totaling approximately $45.1&nbsp;million and $117.2&nbsp;million, respectively.
During the third quarter of 2009, funds were used to purchase 14.9&nbsp;million shares of BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock through participation in BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s rights offering for
an aggregate purchase price of $29.9&nbsp;million. The remaining decrease in cash and equivalents during
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 primarily related to the purchase of 7.4&nbsp;million shares of the
common stock of Bluegreen for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $23&nbsp;million on November
16, 2009 and general and administrative expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC&#146;s acquisition of 14.9&nbsp;million additional shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock increased BFC&#146;s ownership interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp by approximately 7% to 37% and
increased BFC&#146;s voting interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp by approximately 7% to 66%. BankAtlantic
Bancorp is currently prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock, and BFC does not expect
to receive cash dividends from BankAtlantic Bancorp for the foreseeable future.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;16, 2009, we purchased approximately 7.4&nbsp;million additional shares of Bluegreen&#146;s
common stock, which increased our ownership in Bluegreen&#146;s common stock from 9.5&nbsp;million shares, or
29% of Bluegreen outstanding common stock, to 16.9&nbsp;million shares, or 52%. As a result of the
purchase, we have a controlling interest in Bluegreen and, accordingly, since November&nbsp;16, 2009
have consolidated Bluegreen&#146;s results into our financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC&#146;s principal source of liquidity is our available cash, short-term investments, dividends

paid by affiliates relating to our shared service operations from our affiliated companies. We may

anticipated cash flows from operations and other sources of funds, which may include proceeds from
the disposition of certain properties or investments, will provide for anticipated near-term
liquidity needs. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through the foregoing, as

and accordingly, the FDIC now holds the loan. While there may have been an issue with respect to
compliance with certain covenants in the loan agreements, we do not believe that an event of
default had occurred as was alleged. Woodbridge is negotiating with
representatives of the FDIC in an effort to bring about a satisfactory conclusion with regard
to that debt. However, the outcome of the negotiation is uncertain.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, Woodbridge entered into a settlement agreement, as amended (the &#147;Settlement
Agreement&#148;), with the Debtors and the Joint Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the &#147;Joint
Committee&#148;) appointed in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, among other
things, (i)&nbsp;Woodbridge agreed to pay $8&nbsp;million to the Debtors&#146; bankruptcy estates, establish a
$4.5&nbsp;million release fund to be disbursed to third party creditors in exchange for a third party
release and injunction, pay an additional $300,000 to a deposit holders fund and waive and release
substantially all of the claims it had against the Debtors, including its administrative expense
claims through July&nbsp;2008, and (ii)&nbsp;the Debtors (joined by the Joint Committee) agreed to waive and
release any claims they had against Woodbridge and its affiliates. The Settlement Agreement also
provided that if, within one year after the Bankruptcy Court&#146;s confirmation of the Settlement
Agreement, Section&nbsp;172 of the Internal Revenue Code was amended to permit a carry back of tax
losses from calendar years 2007 or 2008 to one or more years preceding calendar year 2005, then
Woodbridge would share a portion of any resulting tax refund with the Debtors and the Joint
Committee based on an agreed upon formula. The Settlement Agreement was subject to a number of
conditions, including the approval of the Bankruptcy Court. On February&nbsp;20, 2009, the Bankruptcy
Court entered an order confirming a plan of liquidation jointly proposed by Levitt and Sons and the
Joint Committee. That order also approved the settlement pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. No
appeal or rehearing of the Bankruptcy Court&#146;s order was timely filed by any party, and the
settlement was consummated on March&nbsp;3, 2009, at which time payment was made in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement. Under cost method accounting, the cost of
settlement and the related $52.9&nbsp;million liability (less $500,000 which was determined as the
settlement holdback and remained as an accrual pursuant to the Settlement Agreement) was recognized
into income in year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, resulting in a $40.4&nbsp;million gain on settlement of
investment in subsidiary. As discussed above we will be allowed to increase our NOL carryback
period to as much as five years for NOLs generated in 2008 or 2009 and obtain refunds of taxes paid
in the newly included carryback years of approximately $34.6&nbsp;million. As described above, under the
terms of the Settlement Agreement, a portion of the refund, upon receipt, will be payable to the
Levitt and Sons estate. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2009, we accrued approximately $10.7
million in connection with the portion of the tax refund pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. As a
result, the gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 was
$29.7&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program which
authorizes the repurchase of up to 20,000,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock at an
aggregate cost of no more than $10&nbsp;million. The share repurchase program replaced our $10&nbsp;million
repurchase program that our Board of Directors approved in October&nbsp;2006 which placed a limitation
on the number of shares which could be repurchased under the program at 1,750,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock. In 2008, we repurchased 100,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock at an aggregate cost
of $54,000 under the prior program. The current program, like the prior program, authorizes
management, at its discretion, to repurchase shares from time to time subject to market conditions
and other factors. No shares were repurchased during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed above, on September&nbsp;21, 2009, BFC and Woodbridge consummated their previously
announced merger pursuant to which Woodbridge merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of
BFC. In connection with the merger, Dissenting Holders who collectively held approximately 4.2
million shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock exercised their appraisal rights and are
entitled to receive an amount equal to the fair value of their shares calculated in accordance with
Florida law. Since these Dissenting Holders have not withdrawn their demands, the Company canceled
and retired the 14,524,557 shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common which the Dissenting Holders
would have been entitled to receive in exchange for their shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a liability of approximately $4.6
million, which represented, in the aggregate, Woodbridge&#146;s offer of $1.10 per share to the
Dissenting Holders with a corresponding reduction to the Company&#146;s additional paid-in capital. Each
Dissenting Holder rejected Woodbridge&#146;s offer of $1.10 per share. The appraisal rights litigation
is ongoing and the results are uncertain, and there is no assurance that the actual payment that we
may be required to make will not exceed the amount accrued.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;21, 2004, the Company sold 15,000 of its 5% Preferred Stock to an investor group in a
private offering. The Company&#146;s 5% Preferred Stock has a stated value of $1,000 per share. The
shares of 5% Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Company, from time to time, at
redemption prices ranging from $1,025 per share for the year 2010 to $1,000 per share for the year
2015 and thereafter. The 5% Preferred Stock liquidation preference is equal to its stated value of
$1,000 per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends or an amount
equal to the applicable redemption price in a voluntary liquidation or winding up of the
Company. Holders of the 5% Preferred Stock have no voting rights, except as provided by Florida
law, and are entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors,
cumulative quarterly cash dividends on each such share at a rate per annum of 5% of the stated
value from the date of issuance. Since June&nbsp;2004, the Company has paid quarterly dividends on the
5% Preferred Stock of $187,500. On December&nbsp;17, 2008, the Company amended (the &#147;Amendment&#148;) certain
of the previously designated relative rights, preferences and limitations of the Company&#146;s 5%
Preferred Stock. The Amendment eliminated the right of the holders of the 5% Preferred Stock to
convert their shares of Preferred Stock into shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. The
Amendment also requires the Company to redeem shares of the 5% Preferred Stock with the net
proceeds it receives in the event (i)&nbsp;the Company sells any of its shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible
Preferred Stock, (ii)&nbsp;the Company sells any shares of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock received upon
conversion of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock or (iii)&nbsp;Benihana redeems any shares of its
Convertible Preferred Stock owned by the Company. Additionally, in the event the Company defaults
on its obligation to make dividend payments on its 5% Preferred Stock, the Amendment entitles the
holders of the 5% Preferred Stock, in place of the Company, to receive directly from Benihana
certain payments on the shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock owned by the Company or on
the shares of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock received by the Company upon conversion of Benihana&#146;s
Convertible Preferred Stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company owns 800,000 shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock, which it purchased
for $25.00 per share. The Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into Benihana&#146;s common stock.
Based on the number of currently outstanding shares of Benihana&#146;s capital stock, the Convertible
Preferred Stock, if converted, would represent an approximate 19% voting interest and an
approximate 9% economic interest in Benihana&#146;s capital stock. The Company has the right to receive
cumulative quarterly dividends at an annual rate equal to 5% or $1.25 per share, payable on the
last day of each calendar quarter. It is anticipated that the Company will continue to receive
approximately $250,000 per quarter in dividends on Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock. The
Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to mandatory redemption of $20&nbsp;million plus accumulated
dividends on July&nbsp;2, 2014 unless we elect to extend the mandatory redemption date to a date no
later than July&nbsp;2, 2024.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;31, 2008, the membership interests of two of the Company&#146;s indirect subsidiaries
which owned two South Florida shopping centers were sold to an unaffiliated third party. The
Company received proceeds of approximately $1.3&nbsp;million in connection with the sale and BFC was
relieved of its guarantee related to the loans collateralized by the shopping centers. BFC believes
that any possible remaining obligations are both remote and immaterial.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At June&nbsp;30, 2009, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC/CCC, Inc. (&#147;BFC/CCC&#148;) had a 10% interest in
a limited partnership as a non-managing general partner. The partnership owns an office building
located in Boca Raton, Florida. In connection with the purchase of the office building in March
2006, BFC/CCC guaranteed repayment of a portion of the non-recourse loan on the property on a joint
and several basis with the managing general partner. BFC/CCC&#146;s maximum exposure under this
guarantee agreement is $2.0&nbsp;million (which is shared on a joint and several basis with the managing
general partner), representing approximately 8.5% of the current indebtedness of the property. In
July&nbsp;2009, BFC/CCC&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary withdrew as partner of the limited partnership and
transferred its 10% interest to another unaffiliated partner. In return, the partner to whom this
interest was assigned agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the release of BFC/CCC
from the guarantee. If the partner is unable to secure such a release, that partner has agreed to
indemnify BFC/CCC&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary for any losses that may arise under the guarantee after
the date of the assignment. There are no carrying amounts on our financial statements at December
31, 2009 for this joint venture.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC/CCC has a 10% interest in a limited liability company that
owns two commercial properties in Hillsborough County, Florida. At December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, the
carrying amount of this investment was approximately $690,000 and $743,000, respectively, which is
included in investments in unconsolidated affiliates in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of
financial condition. In connection with the purchase of the commercial properties in November
2006, BFC and the unaffiliated member each guaranteed the payment of up to a maximum of $5.0
million for certain environmental indemnities and specific obligations that are not related to the
financial performance of the assets. BFC and the unaffiliated member also entered into a cross
indemnification agreement which limits BFC&#146;s obligations under the guarantee to acts of BFC and its
affiliates.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Real Estate Operations segment includes the subsidiaries through which Woodbridge
historically conducted its real estate business activities. These activities are concentrated in
Florida and South Carolina and have included the development and sale of land, the construction and
sale of single family homes and townhomes and the leasing of commercial properties and office
space, and include the operations of Core, the operations of Carolina Oak, which engaged in
homebuilding activities in South Carolina prior to the suspension of those activities in the fourth
quarter of 2008, and Cypress Creek Holdings, which engages in leasing activities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levitt and Sons was also included in the Real Estate Operations segment prior to November&nbsp;9,
2007 at which time it filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition and was deconsolidated from our audited

ceased development activities after it sold all of its remaining units in 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Executive Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge&#146;s operations historically were concentrated in the real estate industry which is
cyclical in nature. In 2009, the real estate markets continued to experience a significant
downturn. Demand for residential and commercial inventory in Florida and South Carolina remained
weak and land sales continued to decline. Sales of real estate at Core for the years ended December
31, 2009, 2008 and 2007were $6.3&nbsp;million, $11.3&nbsp;million and $16.6&nbsp;million, respectively. The
decrease in land sales in 2009 and continued cash flow deficits contributed to, among other things,
the deterioration of Core&#146;s liquidity. As a result, Core severely limited its development
expenditures in Tradition, Florida and completely discontinued development activity in Tradition
Hilton Head. The value of Core&#146;s assets were significantly impaired, resulting in impairment
charges relating to those assets of $78.0&nbsp;million, which includes $13.6&nbsp;million of impairment charges related to assets held for sale during 2009. Core is currently in default under
the terms of all of its loans which have an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $209.9
million, including $71.6&nbsp;million of loans attributable to assets held for sale. Core continues to
pursue all options with its lenders, including offering deeds in lieu and other similar
transactions wherein Core would relinquish title to substantially all of its assets in return for a
release. As of February&nbsp;5, 2010, a significant portion of the land in Tradition Hilton Head had
been placed under the control of a court appointed receiver. Further, Core has accepted an offer to
sell its commercial leasing projects, which has been approved by the lender with substantially all
of the proceeds going to satisfy its obligations to the lender. Negotiations continue on all of
Core&#146;s obligations, however, there is no assurance that Core will be successful in restructuring
any or all of its outstanding debt.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development activities at Carolina Oak, which is within Tradition Hilton Head, were
suspended in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of, among other things, a further deterioration
in consumer confidence, an overall softening of demand for new homes, a decline in the overall
economy, increasing unemployment, a deterioration in the credit markets, and the direct and
indirect impact of the turmoil in the mortgage loan market. In 2009, the housing industry continued
to face significant challenges and Woodbridge made the decision to cease all activities at Carolina
Oak. As previously described in this document, the $37.2&nbsp;million loan that is collateralized by the
Carolina Oak property was declared to be in default by the lender. Subsequently, the lender was
taken over by the FDIC and accordingly, the FDIC now holds the loan.. Woodbridge is negotiating
with representatives of the FDIC in an effort to bring about a satisfactory resolution with regard
to that debt; however, the outcome of the negotiation is uncertain.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Note 22 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; included in Item&nbsp;8 of this
report for a detailed description of Core&#146;s and Woodbridge&#146;s indebtedness.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with the reduced activity at Core and in light of current market conditions,
management made the decision to further reduce Core&#146;s headcount by 41 employees in 2009 and
recorded severance charges of approximately $1.3&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;16, 2009, we purchased approximately 7.4&nbsp;million additional shares of Bluegreen&#146;s
common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $23&nbsp;million, which increased our
ownership in Bluegreen from 9.5&nbsp;million shares, or 29%, to 16.9&nbsp;million shares or 52%. As a result
of the purchase, we have a controlling
interest in Bluegreen and, accordingly, have consolidated Bluegreen&#146;s results since November
16, 2009 into our financial statements.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance and prospects are evaluated using a variety of financial and non-financial
metrics. The key financial metrics utilized to evaluate historical operating performance include
revenues from sales of real estate, margin (which we measure as revenues from sales of real estate
minus cost of sales of real estate), margin percentage (which we measure as margin divided by
revenues from sales of real estate), net (loss)&nbsp;income and return on equity. We also continue to
evaluate and monitor selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, our
ratios of debt to total capitalization and our cash requirements. Non-financial metrics used to
evaluate historical performance include saleable acres in Core and the number of acres in our
backlog. In evaluating future prospects, management considers financial results as well as
non-financial information such as acres in backlog (measured as land subject to an executed sales
contract). Cash requirements are also considered when evaluating future prospects, as are general
economic factors and interest rate trends. These metrics are not an exhaustive list, and
management may from time to time utilize different financial and non-financial information or may
not use all of the metrics mentioned above.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of real estate decreased to $6.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2009 from $13.8&nbsp;million for 2008. Revenues from sales of real estate for the years ended December
31, 2009 and 2008 were comprised of land and home sales, recognition of deferred revenue and look
back revenue. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, Core sold approximately 13 acres, generating
revenues of approximately $1.1&nbsp;million, compared to the sale of approximately 35 acres, which
generated revenues of approximately $9.1&nbsp;million, net of deferred revenue, in 2008. Core recognized
deferred revenue on previously sold land of approximately $5.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December
31, 2009, compared to approximately $1.9&nbsp;million in 2008. Look back revenues for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $32,000 and $145,000, respectively. We also earned
$320,000 in revenues in 2009 from sales of real estate as a result of 1 unit sold in Carolina Oak,
compared to revenues from sales of real estate of $2.5&nbsp;million in 2008 as a result of 8 units sold
in Carolina Oak.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other revenues decreased to $2.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to $3.0
million for 2008. The decrease in other revenues was primarily due to a decrease in marketing fees
collected at Core Communities and fewer impact fees earned in 2009 compared to 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of sales of real estate increased to $82.1&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009
from $22.7&nbsp;million for 2008 due to impairment charges of $80.3&nbsp;million associated with inventory of
real estate recorded in 2009 compared to $13.7&nbsp;million in impairment charges of inventory of real
estate in 2008. Costs of sales of real estate before impairment charges for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 were $1.8&nbsp;million and $9.0&nbsp;million, respectively. The decrease in cost
of sales of real estate excluding impairment charges was due to a decrease in sales of real estate
at Core and Carolina Oak in 2009 compared to 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $16.3&nbsp;million for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009 from $20.6&nbsp;million for 2008. The decrease was a result of, among other things,
lower sales and marketing expenses as a result of a reduced marketing budget, lower developer
expenses related to property owner associations in Tradition, Florida, lower compensation and
benefits expense, and lower office related expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an
increase in severance charges as a result of reductions in force at Core in 2009 and an increase in
property tax expense.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest incurred totaled $7.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $11.0&nbsp;million
for 2008. Interest capitalized totaled $2.0&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $8.9
million for 2008. Net interest expense increased in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 primarily as a result of the Company&#146;s decision to stop the
capitalization of interest in light of the significantly reduced development activities in Florida
and the ceasing of development activities in South Carolina. The increase was partially offset by
lower interest rates during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to 2008. Historically, the
capitalized interest allocated to inventory is charged to cost of sales. Cost of sales of real
estate for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 included previously capitalized interest of
approximately $64,000 and $268,000, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 related to $5.4&nbsp;million of impairment
charges recorded to reduce the carrying value of Core and Carolina Oak&#146;s property and equipment to
their respective fair value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest income decreased to $141,000 during year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 from $1.9&nbsp;million
during 2008. This decrease was mainly due to the repayment of an intersegment loan in June&nbsp;2008,
of which the related interest was eliminated in consolidation, lower interest rates as well as a
decrease in cash balances for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other income decreased to $385,000 during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 from $1.4&nbsp;million
during 2008. This decrease was mainly due to less forfeited deposits in 2009 compared to 2008.

decreased to a loss of $15.6&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 from income of $2.8
million in 2008. The decrease
was mainly due to impairment charges in the amount of $13.6&nbsp;million recorded in the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to no impairment charges recorded in 2008. In addition, three ground
lease parcels comprised of approximately 5 acres were sold in 2008 and were accounted for as
discontinued operations and resulted in a $2.5&nbsp;million gain on sale of real estate assets for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, compared to no comparable sales in discontinued operations in 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of real estate decreased to $13.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2008 from $410.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. This decrease was primarily
attributable to the deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons at November&nbsp;9, 2007 as well as a decrease in
sales of real estate at Core and Levitt Commercial. Levitt and Sons&#146; revenues from sales of real
estate amounted to $387.7&nbsp;million in 2007. Revenues from sales of real estate for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008 at Core decreased to $11.3&nbsp;million, from $16.6&nbsp;million in 2007 reflecting the
sale of approximately 35 acres in 2008 compared to 40 acres in 2007. For the year ended December
31, 2008, we earned revenues from sales of real estate at Carolina Oak of $2.5&nbsp;million reflecting
the delivery of 8 units, while revenues from sales of real estate at Levitt Commercial for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 were $6.6&nbsp;million reflecting the delivery of 17 units in 2007. Levitt
Commercial completed the sale of all remaining flex warehouse units in inventory in 2007 and ceased
development activities thereafter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other revenues decreased $3.1&nbsp;million to $3.0&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008,
compared to $6.1&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. The decrease was primarily due to
decreased title and mortgage operations revenues associated with Levitt and Sons as it was not
included in the consolidated results of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. In
addition, there was decreased marketing income associated with Tradition, Florida.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of sales of real estate increased to $22.7&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2008, as compared to $13.2&nbsp;million (excluding cost of sales, which included impairment provisions,
associated with Levitt and Sons) for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 primarily as a result of
impairment charges related to Carolina Oak&#146;s inventory of real estate recorded in 2008 compared to
no impairment charges recorded at Carolina Oak in 2007. The increase was offset in part by a
decrease in sales of real estate at Core and Levitt Commercial. Cost of sales of real estate at
Core decreased as we sold approximately 35 acres in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, compared to
approximately 40 acres in 2007. We delivered 8 units at Carolina Oak in the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2008, compared to the delivery of 17 units at Levitt Commercial in 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $65.1&nbsp;million to $20.6&nbsp;million during
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared to $85.8&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.
This decrease was primarily related to the deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons at November&nbsp;9, 2007.
Selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to Levitt and Sons in the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007 were $66.6&nbsp;million. Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding those
attributable to Levitt and Sons, increased slightly in 2008 compared to 2007 totaling $20.6&nbsp;million
in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, and $19.2&nbsp;million in 2007. We incurred higher property tax
expense due to less acreage in active development and higher expenses related to the support of
community and commercial associations in our master-planned communities at Core as well as higher
other administrative expenses associated with marketing activities in South Carolina in 2008
compared to 2007. In addition, insurance costs were higher due to the absorption of certain of
Levitt and Sons&#146; insurance costs. The above increases were offset by lower office related expenses,
decreased severance charges and decreased employee compensation, benefits and incentives expense
reflecting a lower associate headcount in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared to 2007 as a
result of staff reductions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest expense consists of interest incurred minus interest capitalized. Interest incurred
for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007 totaled $11.0&nbsp;million and $44.1&nbsp;million,
respectively, while interest capitalized totaled $8.9&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008
compared to $33.9&nbsp;million in 2007. Interest expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 was $2.1
million compared to $10.2&nbsp;million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense was primarily the
result of interest expense related to intersegment loans recorded in the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2007, which was eliminated in consolidation, whereas no comparable interest expense related to
intersegment loans existed in 2008. This decrease in interest expense was partly offset by the
completion of certain phases of development associated with our real estate inventory late in 2007,
which resulted in a decreased amount of assets
which qualified for interest capitalization and, therefore, the expensing of the related
interest was only recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the full year of 2008.
Interest incurred was lower mainly due to decreases in the average interest rates on our debt and
lower outstanding balances of notes and mortgage notes payable primarily due to the deconsolidation
of Levitt and Sons at November&nbsp;9, 2007. At the time of land or home sales, the capitalized
interest allocated to inventory is charged to cost of sales. Cost of sales of real estate for the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007 included previously capitalized interest of approximately
$268,000 and $16.1&nbsp;million, respectively.

due to the deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons at November&nbsp;9, 2007. This decrease was partly offset
by higher forfeited deposits at Core.

increased to $2.8&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 from $1.8&nbsp;million in the same 2007
period. The increase was mainly due to the sale of three ground lease parcels comprised of
approximately 5 acres which resulted in a $2.5&nbsp;million gain on sale of real estate assets accounted
for as discontinued operations and increased commercial lease activity as a result of the opening
of the Landing at Tradition retail power center in late 2007. These increases were partly offset by
an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 mainly as a
result of a depreciation recapture recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Core&#146;s Liquidity and Capital Resources</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009 and December&nbsp;31, 2008, Core had cash and cash equivalents of $2.9&nbsp;million
and $16.9&nbsp;million, respectively. Cash decreased $14.0&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2009 primarily as a result of cash used to fund the development of Core&#146;s projects and payments of
interest on its outstanding debt as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. Core&#146;s
cash balance at December&nbsp;31, 2008 reflected Core&#146;s receipt of a repayment from Woodbridge of a $40
million intercompany loan during the second quarter of 2008, partially offset by a $30&nbsp;million
dividend payment from Core to Woodbridge during the fourth quarter of 2008. At December&nbsp;31, 2009,
Core had no immediate availability under its various lines of credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2009, the recession continued and the demand for residential and commercial inventory
showed no signs of recovery, particularly in the geographic regions where Core&#146;s properties are
located. The decrease in land sales in 2009 and continued cash flow deficits contributed to,
among other things, the deterioration of Core&#146;s liquidity. As a result, Core has severely limited
its development expenditures in Tradition, Florida and has completely discontinued development
activity in Tradition Hilton Head. Its assets have been impaired significantly and in an effort to
bring about an orderly liquidation without a bankruptcy filing, Core commenced negotiations with
all of its lenders to restructure its outstanding debt in light of its cash position and to
liquidate its assets in an orderly way. Core is currently in default under the terms of all of its
outstanding debt totaling approximately $209.9&nbsp;million (including loans associated with assets held
for sale). Core continues to pursue all options with its lenders, including offering deeds in lieu
and other similar transactions wherein Core would relinquish title to substantially all of its
assets. As of February&nbsp;5, 2010, with Core&#146;s concurrence, a significant portion of the land in
Tradition Hilton Head had been placed under the control of a court appointed receiver. While
negotiations with the lender continue, there is no assurance that Core will be successful in
restructuring any or all of its outstanding debt. In consideration of the foregoing, we evaluated
Core&#146;s real estate inventory for impairment on a project-by-project basis. As a result of the
impairment analyses performed, we recorded impairment charges of $63.3&nbsp;million to reduce the
carrying amount of Core&#146;s inventory to its fair value at December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core is also a party to a certain Development Agreement with the city of Hardeeville, SC,
under which Core is obligated to fund $1&nbsp;million towards the building of a fire station. Funding
is scheduled in three installments: the first installment of $100,000 was due October&nbsp;21, 2009; the
second installment of $450,000 was due on January&nbsp;1, 2010; and the final installment was due on
April&nbsp;1, 2010. Additionally, Core is obligated to fund certain staffing costing $200,000 under the
terms of this agreement. Core did not pay any of the required installments and has not funded the
$200,000 payment for staffing. On November&nbsp;5, 2009, Core received a notice of default from the city
for non payment. Core is in discussions with one of its lenders to fund the required payments out
of an interest reserve account established under its loan agreement with the lender while it seeks
to resolve this issue. However, in the event that Core is unable to obtain additional funds to make
these payments, it may be unable to cure the default on its obligation to the city which could
result in a loss of entitlements associated with the development project.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2009, Core reinitiated efforts to sell two of its commercial leasing projects (the
&#147;Projects&#148;) and began soliciting bids from several potential buyers to purchase assets associated
with the Projects. The assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition and Core
determined that it is probable that it will sell the Projects in 2010. Due to this decision, the
assets associated with the Projects that are for sale have been classified as discontinued
operations for all periods presented in accordance with the accounting guidance for the disposal of
long-lived assets Core has accepted an offer to sell the Projects, which has been approved by the
lender with substantially all of the proceeds going to satisfy its obligations to the lender.
However, there can be no assurance that the transaction will close or that the lender will release
Core from its obligations. See Note 12 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for
further information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on an ongoing evaluation of its cost structure and in light of current market
conditions, Core reduced its head count by 41 employees during 2009, resulting in approximately
$1.3&nbsp;million in severance charges which were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negative impact of the adverse real estate market conditions on Core, together with Core&#146;s
limited liquidity, have caused substantial doubt regarding Core&#146;s ability to continue as a going
concern if Woodbridge chooses not to provide Core with the cash needed to meet its obligations when
and as they arise. Woodbridge has
not committed to fund any of Core&#146;s obligations or cash requirements, and there is no
assurance that Woodbridge will provide any funds to Core. Core&#146;s results are reported in the Real
Estate Operations segment in Note 34 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; included
in Item&nbsp;8 of this report. Core&#146;s financial information included in the consolidated financial
statements has been prepared assuming that Core will meet its obligations and continue as a going
concern. As a result, the consolidated financial statements and the financial information provided
for Core do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the development of certain of Core&#146;s projects, community development,
special assessment or improvement districts have been established and may utilize tax-exempt bond
financing to fund construction or acquisition of certain on-site and off-site infrastructure
improvements near or at these communities. If these improvement districts were not established,
Core would need to fund community infrastructure development out of operating cash flow or through
sources of financing or capital, or be forced to delay its development activity. The obligation to
pay principal and interest on the bonds issued by the districts is assigned to each parcel within
the district, and a priority assessment lien may be placed on benefited parcels to provide security
for the debt service. The bonds, including interest and redemption premiums, if any, and the
associated priority lien on the property are typically payable, secured and satisfied by revenues,
fees, or assessments levied on the property benefited. Core pays a portion of the revenues, fees,
and assessments levied by the districts on the properties it still owns that are benefited by the
improvements. Core may also be required to pay down a specified portion of the bonds at the time
each unit or parcel is sold. The costs of these obligations are capitalized to inventory during the
development period and recognized as cost of sales when the properties are sold.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core&#146;s bond financing at December&nbsp;31, 2009 and December&nbsp;31, 2008 consisted of district bonds
totaling $218.7&nbsp;million at each of these dates with outstanding amounts of approximately $170.8
million and $130.5&nbsp;million, respectively. Bond obligations
at December&nbsp;31, 2009 mature in 2035 and 2040. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, Core owned approximately
16% of the property subject to assessments within the community development district and
approximately 91% of the property subject to assessments within the special assessment district.
During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, Core recorded a liability of approximately
$693,000, $584,000 and $1.3&nbsp;million, respectively, in assessments on property owned by it in the
districts. Core is responsible for any assessed amounts until the underlying property is sold and
will continue to be responsible for the annual assessments through the maturity dates of the
respective bonds issued if the property is never sold. Based on Core&#146;s approximate 91% ownership of
property within the special assessment district as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, it will be responsible for
the payment of approximately $10&nbsp;million in assessments by March&nbsp;2011. If Core sells land within
the special assessment district and reduces its ownership percentage, the potential payment of
approximately $10&nbsp;million would decrease in relation to the decrease in the ownership percentage.
In addition, Core has guaranteed payments for assessments under the district bonds in Tradition,
Florida which would require funding if future assessments to be allocated to property owners are
insufficient to repay the bonds. Management has evaluated this exposure based upon the criteria
in accounting guidance for contingencies, and has determined that there have been no substantive
changes to the projected density or land use in the development subject to the bond which would
make it probable that Core would have to fund future shortfalls in assessments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with accounting guidance for real estate, the Company records a liability for
the estimated developer obligations that are fixed and determinable and user fees that are required
to be paid or transferred at the time the parcel or unit is sold to an end user. At each of
December&nbsp;31, 2009 and December&nbsp;31, 2008, the liability related to developer obligations associated
with Core&#146;s ownership of the property was $3.3&nbsp;million, of which $3.1&nbsp;million is included in the
liabilities related to assets held for sale in the accompanying consolidated statements of
financial condition as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and December&nbsp;31, 2008.

terminated during the first quarter of 2010 based on TDC&#146;s default for non-payment. TDC is
contractually obligated to pay all amounts due under the agreement at the time of termination which
is estimated to be approximately $250,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have future obligations relating to the termination of facilities associated with property
and equipment leases that we had entered into that are no longer providing a benefit to us, as well
as termination fees related to contractual obligations we cancelled. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, these

$860,000 and $8.2&nbsp;million, respectively, which were related primarily to its obligations to various
governmental entities to construct improvements in its various communities. It is estimated that
approximately $495,000 of work remains to complete these improvements and it is not currently
anticipated that any outstanding surety bonds will likely be drawn upon.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levitt and Sons had approximately $33.3&nbsp;million of surety bonds related to its ongoing
projects at the time of the filing of the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. In the event that these obligations
are drawn and paid by the surety, Woodbridge could be responsible for up to $8.0&nbsp;million plus costs
and expenses in accordance with the surety
indemnity agreements executed by Woodbridge. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, Woodbridge had
$527,000 and $1.1&nbsp;million, respectively, in surety bond accruals at Woodbridge related to certain
bonds where management believes it to be probable that Woodbridge will be required to reimburse the
surety under applicable indemnity agreements. Woodbridge reimbursed the surety approximately
$348,000 and $532,000 during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in
accordance with the indemnity agreement for bond claims paid during the period, while no
reimbursements were made in 2007. It is unclear whether and to what extent the remaining
outstanding surety bonds of Levitt and Sons will be drawn and the extent to which Woodbridge may be
responsible for additional amounts beyond this accrual. There is no assurance that Woodbridge will
not be responsible for amounts in excess of the $527,000 accrual. Woodbridge will not receive any
repayment, assets or other consideration as recovery of any amounts it may be required to pay. In
September&nbsp;2008, a surety filed a lawsuit to require Woodbridge to post collateral against a portion
of the surety bonds exposure in connection with demands made by a municipality. Woodbridge believes
that the municipality does not have the right to demand payment under the bonds and Woodbridge
initiated a lawsuit against the municipality. Woodbridge does not believe a loss is probable and
accordingly have not accrued any amount related to this claim. However, based on claims made on the
bonds, the surety requested that Woodbridge post a $4.0&nbsp;million escrow deposit as security while
the matter is litigated with the municipality, and Woodbridge has complied with that request.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;9, 2007, Woodbridge put in place an employee fund and offered up to $5&nbsp;million of
severance benefits to terminated Levitt and Sons employees to supplement the limited termination
benefits paid by Levitt and Sons to those employees. Levitt and Sons was restricted in the payment
of termination benefits to its former employees by virtue of the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. In 2009, Core
reduced its workforce by approximately 41 employees mainly as a result of the challenging
conditions in the real estate market and the negative impact it has had on Core&#146;s liquidity.
Woodbridge incurred severance and benefits related restructuring charges in the year ended December
31, 2009 of approximately $1.4&nbsp;million, while Woodbridge incurred charges of approximately $2.2
million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, Woodbridge
paid approximately $415,000 in severance and termination charges related to the above described
employee fund or for employees other than Levitt and Sons employees while it paid approximately
$4.1&nbsp;million in severance and termination charges in the same 2008 period. Employees entitled to
participate in the fund either received a payment stream, which in certain cases extends over two
years, or a lump sum payment, dependent on a variety of factors.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to conditions in the economy and real estate and credit markets, Bluegreen&#146;s focus
has been on efforts to improve its cash flows from operations by deliberately reducing the number
of VOI sales transactions for which it provides financing and to increase its selling and marketing
efficiencies in the Bluegreen Resorts segment. Bluegreen also made a decision to pursue
opportunities to grow its cash fee-based service businesses. While Bluegreen cash flows from
operations and the Bluegreen Resorts segment operating margin reflects the success of these
efforts, the Bluegreen Communities segment continued to struggle given the low consumer demand for
homesites.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed further under &#147;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148;, Bluegreen Resorts sales
operations are materially dependent on the availability of liquidity in the credit markets.
Historically, Bluegreen has provided financing to a significant portion of its Bluegreen Resorts
customers. Such financing typically involves the consumer making a minimum 10% cash down payment,
with the balance being financed over a ten-year period. As Bluegreen Resorts&#146; selling, general and
administrative expenses typically exceed the cash down payment, Bluegreen has historically
maintained credit facilities pursuant to which Bluegreen pledged or sold its consumer note
receivables. Furthermore, Bluegreen also engaged in private placement term securitization
transactions to periodically pay down all or a portion of its note receivable credit facilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been and continues to be an unprecedented disruption in the credit markets that has
made obtaining additional and replacement external sources of liquidity more difficult and, if
available, more expensive. For most of 2009, the term securitization market was severely limited
and, as a result, financial institutions have been and continue to be reluctant to enter into new
credit facilities for the purpose of providing financing on consumer receivables. Several lenders
to the timeshare industry, including certain of Bluegreen&#146;s lenders, have announced that they will
either be exiting the finance business or will not be entering into new financing commitments for
the foreseeable future. In addition, financing for real estate acquisition and development and the
capital markets for corporate debt have generally been unavailable to Bluegreen.

<DIV align="right" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">&nbsp;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Bluegreen believes that the market for its Resorts product remains relatively strong,
Bluegreen is continuing to deemphasize sales to conserve cash because of the uncertainties in the
credit markets. In an effort to conserve cash and availability under Bluegreen receivables credit
facilities, Bluegreen implemented strategic initiatives which have included closing certain sales
offices; eliminating what they identified as lower-efficiency marketing programs; emphasizing cash
sales and higher cash down payments as well as pursuing other cash-based
services; reducing overhead, including eliminating a significant number of staff positions
across a variety of areas at various locations; limiting sales to borrowers who meet newly applied
underwriting standards; and increasing interest rates on new sales transactions for which Bluegreen
provides financing. Bluegreen&#146;s goal is to reduce the number of sales while increasing the
ultimate profitability of the sales it makes. Additional information on Bluegreen&#146;s strategic
initiatives is provided in &#147;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148; below. Bluegreen believes that it has
adequate timeshare inventory to satisfy its projected sales for 2010 and based on anticipated sales
levels, for a number of years thereafter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen continues to actively pursue additional credit facility capacity, capital markets
transactions, and alternative financing solutions, and hopes that the steps being taken will
position Bluegreen to maintain its existing credit relationships as well as attract new sources of
capital. Regardless of the state of the credit markets, Bluegreen believes that its resorts
management and finance operations will continue to represent recurring cash-generating sources of
income which do not require material liquidity support from the credit markets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the vacation ownership business has historically been capital intensive, Bluegreen&#146;s
goal is to leverage its sales and marketing, mortgage servicing, resort management, title and
construction expertise to generate fee-based-service relationships with third parties that produce
strong cash flows and require less capital investment. During 2009, Bluegreen began providing
resort management services to four resorts under these agreements. In addition, for the Bluegreen
Interim Period, Bluegreen sold $8.9&nbsp;million of outside developer inventory and earned sales and
marketing commissions of approximately $5.4&nbsp;million, as well as title fees on such transactions.
Bluegreen has also begun providing resort design and development services and mortgage services
under certain of these arrangements. Bluegreen intends to pursue additional fee-based services
relationships and believes that these activities will become an increasing portion of its business
over time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience seasonal
fluctuations in its gross revenues and results of operations. This seasonality may result in
fluctuations in its quarterly operating results. Although Bluegreen expects to see more potential
customers at its sales offices during the quarters ending in June and September, ultimate
recognition of the resulting sales during these periods may be delayed due to complex down payment
requirements for recognition of real estate sales under GAAP or due to the timing of development
and the requirement that Bluegreen uses the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that inflation in general or increased prices for Bluegreen&#146;s VOIs and homesites
adversely impacts consumer demand, Bluegreen&#146;s results of operations could be adversely impacted.
Also, to the extent inflationary trends, tightened credit markets or other factors affect interest
rates, Bluegreen&#146;s debt service costs may increase. There is no assurance that Bluegreen will be
able to increase or maintain the current level of its sales prices or that increased construction
costs will not have a material adverse impact on its gross margin.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen Communities business is being adversely impacted by the deterioration in the real
estate markets. Demand for its homesites has decreased as well as sales volume and such reductions
have adversely impacted the carrying costs of Bluegreen Communities&#146; inventories. There can be no
assurances that future changes in Bluegreen&#146;s intentions or pricing will not result in future
material inventory valuation adjustments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen has historically financed a majority of Bluegreen Resorts sales of VOIs, and
accordingly, are subject to the risk of defaults by customers. GAAP requires that Bluegreen
reduces sales of VOIs by its estimate of future uncollectible note balances on originated VOI
receivables, excluding any benefit for the value of future recoveries. The allowance for loan
losses for the Bluegreen Interim Period was approximately $4.0&nbsp;million and was mainly associated
with Bluegreen Resorts. The allowance for loan losses attributable to Bluegreen Communities was not
significant.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen believes that rising unemployment in the United States and adverse economic
conditions in general have adversely impacted the performance of Bluegreen&#146;s notes receivable
portfolio. However, Bluegreen anticipates that credit underwriting standards on new loan
originations and increasing customer equity in the existing loan portfolio will have a favorable
impact on the performance of the portfolio over time.

VOI is recovered and resold in the normal course of business. In most cases the resales of the
VOI&#146;s partially mitigate the loss from the default, as these recoveries generally range from
approximately 40% to 100% of the defaulted principal balance depending on the age of the defaulted
receivable. Bluegreen may also remarket VOI&#146;s relating to defaulted receivables on behalf of note
holders in exchange for a remarketing fee designed to approximate its sales and marketing costs.
From time to time, Bluegreen will reacquire a defaulted note receivable from one of its off-balance
sheet term securitization or purchase facility transactions by substituting the defaulted
receivable for a performing receivable. The related VOI that secured the defaulted note receivable
is reacquired at a price equal to the defaulted principal amount, which typically is in excess of
Bluegreen&#146;s historical cost of product. The reacquisition of inventory in this manner has resulted
in an increase in Bluegreen Resort&#146;s cost of sales.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent economic events have resulted in further constrictions in the financial markets to
unprecedented low levels. There can be no assurance that Bluegreen will be able to secure
financing for its VOI notes receivable on acceptable terms, if at all.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen is in the process of negotiating a significant debt extension on one of its credit
facilities (See the &#147;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148; section for further information). In
connection with debt renewals and extensions, Bluegreen may, in certain cases, agree to pay higher
interest rates and fees. In addition, conditions in the commercial credit markets are expected to
increase interest rates on new debt Bluegreen may obtain from time to time in the future. Any such
increased interest rates would increase Bluegreen&#146;s expenses and adversely impact its results of
operations.

of variable interest entities in January&nbsp;2010 (See &#147;Accounting Pronouncements Not-Yet Adopted) will
significantly increase both interest income and interest expense due to the recognition of
approximately $453.6&nbsp;million of notes receivable and $411.4&nbsp;million of non-recourse
receivable-backed debt, which are currently accounted for off-balance sheet, and which Bluegreen
expects will be consolidated and included on-balance sheet, on a prospective basis, beginning in
2010.

operations facilitate the monetization of its VOI notes receivable through its various credit

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective January&nbsp;2010, the adoption of new accounting standards requires consolidation of

<DIV align="right" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">&nbsp;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically Bluegreen&#146;s business model has depended on the availability of credit in the
commercial markets. Resorts sales are generally dependent upon Bluegreen providing financing to
its buyers. Bluegreen&#146;s ability to sell and/or borrow against its notes receivable from VOI buyers
is a critical factor in its continued liquidity. When Bluegreen sells VOIs, a financed buyer is
only required to pay a minimum of 10% to 20% of the purchase price in cash at the time of sale;
however, selling, marketing, and administrative expenses attributable to the sale are primarily
cash expenses and exceed the buyer&#146;s minimum required down-payment. Accordingly, having financing
facilities available for the hypothecation, sale, or transfer of these vacation ownership
receivables is a critical factor in Bluegreen&#146;s ability to meet its short and long-term cash needs.
Historically, Bluegreen has relied on its ability to sell receivables in the term securitization
market in order to generate liquidity and create capacity in its receivable facilities. In
addition, maintaining adequate VOI inventory to sell and pursue growth into new markets has
historically required in the incurrence of debt for the acquisition, construction and development
of new resorts. Bluegreen Communities has also historically incurred debt for the acquisition and
development of its residential land communities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2008, there have been unprecedented disruptions in the credit markets, which have made
obtaining additional and replacement external sources of liquidity more difficult and more costly
in the term securitization market. There is significantly reduced activity and transactions that
have been consummated have been on dramatically more adverse terms. As a result, financial
institutions are reluctant to enter into new credit facilities for the purpose of providing
financing on consumer receivables. Several lenders to the timeshare industry, including certain of
Bluegreen&#146;s lenders, have announced that they either have or will be exiting the resort finance
business or will not be entering into new financing commitments for the foreseeable future. In
addition, financing for real estate acquisition and development and the capital markets for
corporate debt have generally been unavailable on reasonable terms, if at all.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen has certain strategic initiatives in place with a view to better position its
operations in light of the downturn in the commercial credit markets. Bluegreen intends to continue
to monitor its results as well as the external environment in order to attempt to adjust its
business to existing conditions. The ongoing goals of its strategic initiatives are designed to
conserve cash and enhance its financial position, to the extent possible by:

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the vacation ownership business has historically been capital intensive, one of
Bluegreen&#146;s principal goals is to leverage its sales and marketing, mortgage servicing, resort

business relationships that produce strong cash flows for its business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen has a material amount of debt maturing or requiring partial repayment in 2010, as
well as facilities for which the advance period has or will expire. Bluegreen intends to seek to
renew, extend or refinance certain of its debt issuances and credit facilities and Bluegreen
believes that the implementation of its strategic initiatives has positioned them to address these
matters with its existing and future lenders. However, there is no assurance that Bluegreen will
be successful in its efforts to renew, extend or refinance its debt, and if Bluegreen is not
successful, its liquidity would be significantly adversely impacted. Further, while Bluegreen may
seek to raise
additional debt or equity financing in the future to fund operations or repay outstanding debt,
there is no assurance that such financing will be available to them on favorable terms or at all.
In light of the current trading price of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock, financing involving the issuance
of its common stock or securities convertible into its common stock would be highly dilutive to its
existing shareholders.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen&#146;s levels of debt and debt service requirements have several important effects on its
operations, including the following: (i)&nbsp;its significant cash requirements to service debt reduces
the funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increase its vulnerability
to adverse economic and industry conditions, as well as conditions in the credit markets,
generally; (ii)&nbsp;its leverage position increases its vulnerability to economic and competitive
pressures; (iii)&nbsp;the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in indentures, credit
agreements and other agreements relating to its indebtedness requires Bluegreen to meet certain
financial tests and restricts its ability to, among other things, borrow additional funds, dispose
of assets, make investments or pay cash dividends on or repurchase common stock (although Bluegreen
does not currently believe that any such transactions are likely to be structured so as to
materially limit its ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock, if its board were to choose
to do so, or its ability to repurchase shares in the near term; although there is no assurance that
this will remain true in the future); and (iv)&nbsp;its leverage position may limit funds available for
working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes. Certain of
Bluegreen&#146;s competitors operate on a less leveraged basis and have greater operating and financial
flexibility than they do.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is a discussion of Bluegreen&#146;s material purchase and credit facilities,
including those that were important sources of its liquidity as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. These
facilities do not constitute all of its outstanding indebtedness as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.
Bluegreen&#146;s other indebtedness includes outstanding junior subordinated debentures, borrowings
collateralized by real estate inventories that were not incurred pursuant to a significant credit
facility, and capital leases.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended and restated timeshare notes receivable purchase facility with Branch Banking and
Trust Company (&#147;BB&#038;T&#148;) (the &#147;BB&#038;T Purchase Facility&#148;) provides for the sale of Bluegreen&#146;s
timeshare receivables at an advance rate of 67.5% of the principal balance up to a cumulative
purchase price of $150.0&nbsp;million on a revolving basis, subject to the terms of the facility,
eligible collateral and customary terms and conditions. The BB&#038;T Purchase Facility revolving
advance period under the facility will end on June&nbsp;29, 2010. Should a &#147;takeout financing&#148; (as
defined in the applicable facility agreements) occur prior to June&nbsp;29, 2010, the facility limit
will either remain at the current facility limit of $150.0&nbsp;million or decrease to $100.0&nbsp;million,
under certain circumstances. While ownership of the receivables is transferred for legal purposes,
the transfers of receivables under the facility are accounted for as a financing transaction for
financial accounting purposes. Accordingly, the receivables will continue to be reflected as
assets and the associated obligations will be reflected as liabilities on our balance sheet. The
BB&#038;T Purchase Facility is nonrecourse and was not guaranteed by Bluegreen.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the outstanding balance of the BB&#038;T Purchase Facility reflected an
advance of 80.7% on the receivables transferred to BB&#038;T under the facility; however, Bluegreen will
equally share with BB&#038;T in the excess cash flows generated by the receivables sold (excess meaning
after customary payments of fees, interest and principal under the facility) until the advance rate
on the existing receivables decreases to 67.5% as the outstanding balance amortizes. The interest
rate on the BB&#038;T Purchase Facility is the prime rate plus 2.5%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Bluegreen Interim Period, Bluegreen pledged $9.5&nbsp;million of VOI notes receivable to
this facility and received cash proceeds of $2.0&nbsp;million. Bluegreen also made repayments of $4.9
million on the facility during the same period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U><I>Liberty Bank Facility</I></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen has a $75.0&nbsp;million revolving timeshare receivables hypothecation facility with a
syndicate of lenders led by Liberty Bank and assembled by Wellington Financial (the &#147;Liberty Bank
Facility&#148;). The facility provides for a 90% advance on eligible receivables pledged under the
facility during a two-year period ending on August&nbsp;27, 2010, subject to customary terms and
conditions. Amounts borrowed under the facility and interest incurred will be repaid as cash is
collected on the pledged receivables, with the remaining balance, if any, due on August&nbsp;27, 2014.
The facility bears interest at a rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 2.5%, subject to a floor of
5.75%. As the Liberty Bank facility is revolving, availability under the facility increases up to
the $75.0&nbsp;million facility limit as cash is received on the VOI notes receivable collateralized
under the facility and Liberty Bank is repaid through the expiration of the advance period,
pursuant to the terms of the facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Bluegreen Interim Period, Bluegreen pledged $7.6&nbsp;million of VOI notes receivable to
this facility and received cash proceeds of $729,000. Bluegreen also made repayments of $2.8
million under the facility during the same period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U><I>Other Effective Receivable Capacity </I></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the terms of certain of Bluegreen&#146;s prior term securitizations and similar type
transactions, Bluegreen has the ability to substitute new eligible VOI notes receivable into such
facilities in the event receivables that were previously sold in such transactions are defaulted or
are the subject of an owner upgrade transaction, subject to certain limitations. These
substitutions result in Bluegreen receiving additional cash through its monthly distribution on its
retained interest in notes receivable sold. Bluegreen intends to continue to use this other
effective receivable capacity, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable facilities.
As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the aggregate remaining substitution capacity under all of such existing
facilities would allow Bluegreen to substitute approximately $120.5&nbsp;million of eligible VOI notes
receivable in the future, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable facilities.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture has a $45.0&nbsp;million revolving VOI receivables credit
facility with GE (the &#147;GE Bluegreen/Big Cedar Receivables Facility&#148;). Bluegreen Corporation has
guaranteed the full payment and performance of the Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture in connection
with the GE Bluegreen/Big Cedar Receivables Facility. The advance period under this facility has
expired and all outstanding borrowings mature no later than April&nbsp;16, 2016. The facility has
detailed requirements with respect to the eligibility of receivables for inclusion and other
conditions to funding. The facility includes affirmative, negative and financial covenants and
events of default. All principal and interest payments received on pledged receivables are applied
to principal and interest due under the facility. Indebtedness under the facility bears interest
adjusted monthly at a rate equal to the 30&nbsp;day LIBOR rate plus 1.75%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Bluegreen Interim Period, Bluegreen repaid $1.7&nbsp;million under this facility.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen has a credit facility with Wells Fargo Foothill, LLC (&#147;Wells Fargo&#148;). Historically,
Bluegreen has primarily used this facility for borrowings collateralized by the pledge of certain
VOI receivables which typically have been Bluegreen&#146;s one-year term receivables. The borrowing
period for advances on eligible receivables expired on December&nbsp;31, 2009, and the maturity date of
all borrowings is December&nbsp;31, 2010. The advance rate ranges from 85% to 90% of certain VOI
receivables. Borrowings under this facility are subject to eligible collateral and customary terms
and conditions. The interest rate charged on outstanding receivable borrowings under the facility,
as amended, is the prime lending rate plus 0.25% when the average monthly outstanding loan balance
under certain sub-lines is greater than or equal to $15.0&nbsp;million. If the average monthly
outstanding loan balance under certain sub-lines is less than $15.0&nbsp;million, the interest rate is
the greater of 4.00% or the prime lending rate plus 0.50%. All principal and interest payments
received on pledged receivables are applied to principal and interest due under the facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Bluegreen Interim Period, Bluegreen pledged $7.0&nbsp;million of notes receivable to this
facility and received cash proceeds of $6.2&nbsp;million. Bluegreen also made repayments of $4.2
million during the same period.

Loan&#148;), is June&nbsp;30, 2012. Approximately $70.1&nbsp;million was outstanding on this loan as of December
31, 2009. Maturity dates for two project loans related to Bluegreen&#146;s Fountains resort in Orlando,
Florida (the &#147;Fountains Loans&#148;) are September&nbsp;2010 and March&nbsp;2011, with $10.6&nbsp;million and $6.7
million, respectively, outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. Principal payments are effected
through agreed-upon release prices as timeshare interests in the resorts collateralizing the GMAC
AD&#038;C Facility are sold, subject to periodic minimum required amortization on the Club 36 Loan and
the Fountains Loans. The facility bears interest at a rate equal to the 30-day LIBOR plus 4.50%.
For the Bluegreen Interim Period, Bluegreen repaid $5.5&nbsp;million of the outstanding balance under
this facility. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, Bluegreen had no availability under this facility.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen has an outstanding balance under a credit facility (the &#147;GMAC Communities Facility&#148;)
historically used to finance its Bluegreen Communities real estate acquisitions and development
activities. The GMAC Communities Facility is secured by the real property homesites (and personal
property related thereto) at the following Bluegreen Communities projects (the &#147;Secured Projects&#148;):
Havenwood at Hunter&#146;s Crossing (New Braunfels, Texas); The Bridges at Preston Crossings (Grayson
County, Texas); King Oaks (College Station, Texas); Vintage Oaks at the Vineyard (New Braunfels,
Texas); and Sanctuary Cove at St. Andrews Sound (Waverly, Georgia). In addition, the GMAC
Communities Facility is secured by certain of Bluegreen&#146;s golf courses: The Bridges at Preston
Crossings (Grayson County, Texas) and Sanctuary Cove (Waverly, Georgia). The period during which
Bluegreen can add additional projects to the GMAC Communities Facility has expired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen will start making minimum quarterly cumulative payments commencing in January&nbsp;2010
with the final maturity of December&nbsp;31, 2012, according to the agreement. Principal payments are
effected through agreed-upon release prices as real estate collateralizing the GMAC Communities
Facility is sold, subject to the minimum required amortization discussed above. The interest rate
on the GMAC Communities Facility is the prime rate plus 2%, subject to the following floors: (1)
10% until the balance of the loan has been reduced by a total of $25&nbsp;million from the closing date balance, (2)&nbsp;8% until the
balance of the loan is less than or equal to $20&nbsp;million, and (3)&nbsp;6% thereafter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the previously discussed sale of Bluegreen&#146;s golf courses at Carolina
National (Southport, North Carolina), the Preserve at Jordan Lake (Chapel Hill, North Carolina),
Brickshire (New Kent, Virginia), and Chapel Ridge (Pittsboro, NC) during December&nbsp;2009, Bluegreen
repaid $7.1&nbsp;million under this facility as a release payment for the sold courses which had been
part of the collateral for the GMAC Communities Facility. For the Bluegreen Interim Period,
Bluegreen repaid a total of $7.8&nbsp;million under this facility.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, Bluegreen had approximately $24.5&nbsp;million of outstanding debt to
Wachovia Bank, N.A. (&#147;Wachovia&#148;) under various notes payable collateralized by certain of its
timeshare resorts or sales offices (the &#147;Wachovia Notes Payable&#148;). The maturity date of a $10.5
million note payable collateralized by Bluegreen&#146;s Williamsburg resort will expire on April&nbsp;30,
2010. Bluegreen has a non-binding term sheet with Wachovia to refinance the Wachovia Notes Payable,
extending the maturity to 24&nbsp;months after the closing of the extension. The term sheet also
includes the Wachovia Line-of-credit (See section below &#151; Unsecured Credit Facility &#151; Wachovia
Line-of-Credit) which had a balance of $15.7&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. The term sheet and
subsequent discussions required that Bluegreen makes release principal payments as the VOIs which
will collateralize the extended loan are sold, subject to a minimum monthly amortization. The
extended loan would consolidate the Wachovia Notes Payable and the Wachovia Line-of-Credit into one
term loan which bears interest at the 3-month LIBOR &#043; 6.87%. The term sheet contemplates Bluegreen
providing additional collateral for this facility and amending covenants, other terms and
conditions. There is no assurance that the transactions contemplated by the term sheet will occur
on these terms, if at all.

has historically been used to facilitate the borrowing of funds for resort acquisition and
development activities. Bluegreen has guaranteed all sub-loans under the master agreement.
Interest on the Textron AD&#038;C Facility is equal to the prime rate plus 1.25% &#151; 1.50% and is due

acquisition and development of its Odyssey Dells Resort (the &#147;Odyssey Sub-Loan&#148;). The outstanding
borrowings under the Odyssey Sub-Loan mature on December&nbsp;31, 2011. The Sub-Loan requires a periodic
minimum required principal amortization. The first minimum required principal payment in March&nbsp;2010
was approximately $0.4&nbsp;million with
additional minimum required principal payments of $1.0&nbsp;million per quarter thereafter through
maturity. Bluegreen will continue to pay Textron principal payments as Bluegreen sells timeshare
interests that collateralize the Odyssey Sub-Loan, and these payments will count towards the
minimum required principal payments. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, Bluegreen&#146;s outstanding borrowings
under the Sub-Loan totaled approximately $7.0&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen currently has an unsecured line-of-credit with Wachovia. Amounts borrowed under the
line bear interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 1.75% (1.98 % at December&nbsp;31, 2009). Interest is due
monthly. The line-of-credit agreement contains certain covenants and conditions typical of
arrangements of this type.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current maturity of this line-of-credit is April&nbsp;30, 2010; however Bluegreen has received
a non-binding term sheet from Wachovia to extend the maturity for an additional 24&nbsp;months from the
closing of the extension, subject to required monthly amortization. As contemplated in the term
sheet, the extended loan would consolidate the <I>Wachovia Notes Payable </I>and the <I>Wachovia
Line-of-Credit </I>into one term loan, which would bear interest at the 3-month LIBOR &#043; 6.87%. The

million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. Bluegreen estimates that the cash required to complete communities
in which sales have occurred was approximately $7.7&nbsp;million. These amounts assume that Bluegreen
is not obligated to develop any building, project or amenity in which a commitment has not been
made in a sales contract with a customer; however, Bluegreen anticipates that it will incur such
obligations in the future. Bluegreen plans to fund these expenditures over the next three to ten
years, primarily with cash generated from operations. There is no assurance that Bluegreen will be
able to generate the cash from operations necessary to complete the foregoing commitments or that
actual costs will not exceed those estimated.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Vacation Ownership Receivables Purchase Facilities &#151; Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen historically chose to monetize its receivables through various facilities and
through periodic term securitization transactions, as these arrangements provided them with cash
inflows both currently and in the future at what they believe to be competitive rates without
adding leverage to its financial condition or retaining recourse for losses on the receivables
sold. In addition, these sale transactions have historically generated gains on its financial
results on a periodic basis, which would not be realized under a traditional financing arrangement.
Bluegreen made the decision to structure future sales of its notes receivable so that they are
accounted for as on-balance sheet borrowings. Recently, the term securitization market has had
minimal activity and there is no assurance that these types of transactions will be available in
the future at acceptable cost, if at all.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, Bluegreen has been a party to a number of securitization-type transactions, all
of which in its opinion utilize customary structures and terms for transactions of this type. In
each securitization-type transaction, Bluegreen sold receivables to a wholly-owned special purpose
entity which, in turn, sold the receivables either directly to third parties or to a trust
established for the transaction. The receivables were sold on a non-recourse basis (except for
breaches of certain representations and warranties) and the special purpose entity retained
residual interest in the receivables sold. Bluegreen has acted as servicer of the receivables pools
in each transaction for a fee, with the servicing obligations specified under the applicable
transaction documents. Under the terms of the applicable transaction documents, the cash payments
received from obligors on the receivables sold are distributed to the investors (which, depending
on the transaction, may acquire the receivables directly or purchase an interest in, or make loans
secured by the receivables to, a trust that owns the receivables), parties providing services in
connection with the facility, and its special purpose subsidiary as the holder of the retained
interest in the receivables according to specified formulas. In general, available funds are
applied monthly to pay fees to service providers, make interest and principal payments to
investors, fund required reserves, if any, and pay distributions in respect of the retained
interests in the receivables, pursuant to the terms of the transaction documents. However, to the
extent the portfolio of receivables fails to satisfy specified performance criteria (as may occur
due to an increase in default rates or loan loss severity) or other trigger events, the funds
received from obligors are distributed on an accelerated basis to investors. In effect, during a
period in which the accelerated payment formula is applicable, funds are paid to outside investors
until they receive the full amount owed to them and only then are payments made to Bluegreen&#146;s
subsidiary in its capacity as the holder of the retained interests. Depending on the circumstances
and the transaction, the application of the accelerated payment formula may be permanent or
temporary until the trigger event is cured. If the accelerated payment formula were to become
applicable, the cash flow on the retained interests in the receivables would be reduced until the
outside investors were paid or the regular payment formula was resumed. Such a reduction in cash
flow could cause a decline in the fair value of Bluegreen&#146;s retained interests in the receivables
sold. Declines in fair value that are determined to be other than temporary are charged to
operations in the current period. In each facility, the failure of the pool of receivables to
comply with specified portfolio covenants can create a trigger event, which results in the
utilization of the accelerated payment formula (in certain circumstances until the trigger event is
cured and in other circumstances permanently) and, to the extent of any remaining commitment to
purchase receivables from Bluegreen&#146;s special purpose subsidiary, the suspension or termination of
that commitment. In addition, in each securitization-type facility, certain breaches of Bluegreen&#146;s
obligations as servicer or other events allow the indenture trustee to cause the servicing to be
transferred to a substitute third party servicer. In that case, Bluegreen&#146;s obligation to service
the receivables would terminate and
they would cease to receive a servicing fee.

off-balance sheet arrangements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting guidance for transfers of
financial assets, which became effective for us on January&nbsp;1, 2010. This amendment addresses the
effects of eliminating the QSPE concept and responds to concerns about the application of certain
key provisions of previous accounting rules, including concerns over the transparency of an
enterprise&#146;s involvement with VIEs. As a result of the adoption of this amendment on January&nbsp;1,
2010, Bluegreen expects that it will be required to consolidate its QSPEs described in Note 4 to
our consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements&#148; included in Item&nbsp;8 of this report for additional information relating to the effects of
this accounting pronouncement.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. is a Florida-based financial services holding company offering a
full range of products and services through BankAtlantic, our wholly-owned banking subsidiary. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp had total consolidated assets of approximately $4.8
billion, deposits of approximately $4.0&nbsp;billion and shareholders&#146; equity of approximately $141.6
million. BankAtlantic Bancorp operates through two primary business segments: BankAtlantic and
BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;28, 2007, BankAtlantic Bancorp completed the sale to Stifel Financial Corp.
(&#147;Stifel&#148;) of Ryan Beck Holdings, Inc. (&#147;Ryan Beck&#148;), a subsidiary engaged in retail and
institutional brokerage and investment banking. As a consequence of the sale of Ryan Beck to
Stifel, the results of operations of Ryan Beck are presented as &#147;Discontinued Operations&#148; in the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower loss from continuing operations at BankAtlantic during 2009 compared to the same
2008 period primarily resulted from BankAtlantic recognizing a $31.7&nbsp;million income tax benefit
during 2009 in connection with a change in tax regulations which enabled BankAtlantic to utilize
additional net operating losses, while during 2008, BankAtlantic established a deferred tax
valuation allowance on its entire amount of net deferred tax assets resulting in a tax provision of
$31.1&nbsp;million. BankAtlantic&#146;s 2009 loss before income taxes increased by $45.4&nbsp;million compared to
2008. The higher 2009 loss primarily resulted from a $78.9&nbsp;million increase in the provision for
loan losses, a $30.3&nbsp;million reduction in net interest income and $8.0&nbsp;million of lower
non-interest income. The increase in BankAtlantic&#146;s loss before income taxes was partially offset
by $71.8&nbsp;million of lower non-interest expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial increase in the provision for loan losses resulted primarily from a
significant increase in charge-offs and loan loss reserves in our consumer, residential and
commercial real estate loan portfolios. These portfolios continued to be negatively affected by
the current adverse economic environment, especially declining collateral values and rising
unemployment. If economic and real estate market conditions do not improve, we believe that
additional provisions for loan losses may be required in future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction in BankAtlantic&#146;s net interest income was primarily due to a decline in earning
assets. BankAtlantic reduced its assets in order to improve its liquidity and regulatory capital
ratios. BankAtlantic&#146;s average earnings assets declined by $790.6&nbsp;million during 2009 compared to
2008.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction in non-interest income primarily relates to a decline in overdraft fees.
Overdraft fees represented approximately 54% of our non-interest income during 2009. This
overdraft fee income decline reflects, in part,
management&#146;s focus on targeting retail customers and businesses that maintain higher average
deposit balances which generally will result in fewer overdrafts per account. We believe that this
trend of declining overdraft fees will continue and could be accelerated by recent overdraft rules
adopted by the Federal Reserve effective July&nbsp;1, 2010. Congress has also proposed additional
legislation to further limit the assessment of overdraft fees. These events could significantly
reduce our overdraft fee income in subsequent periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to adverse economic conditions, BankAtlantic during 2009 continued to reduce
expenses with a view towards increasing operating efficiencies. These operating expense
initiatives included workforce reductions, consolidation of certain back-office facilities,
renegotiation of vendor contracts, outsourcing of certain back-office functions, reduction in
marketing expenses and other targeted expense reductions. Also, restructuring charges and other
impairments declined by $33.0&nbsp;million. These expense reductions were partially offset by $8.2
million of additional FDIC insurance premiums, including a $2.4&nbsp;million FDIC special assessment in
June&nbsp;2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant decline in BankAtlantic&#146;s performance during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008
compared to the same 2007 period primarily resulted from a $48.3&nbsp;million goodwill impairment
charge, the establishment of a $66.9&nbsp;million deferred tax valuation allowance, a $64.5&nbsp;million
increase in the provision for loan losses and a decline in non-interest income. These items were
partially offset by lower non-interest expenses, excluding the goodwill impairment charge. The
substantial increase in BankAtlantic&#146;s provision for loan losses for 2008 compared to 2007 reflects
net charge-offs for 2008 of $97.4&nbsp;million compared to $20.4&nbsp;million for 2007 and a $31.6&nbsp;million
increase in the allowance for loan losses during 2008. The charge-offs and loan reserve increases
were primarily related to commercial real estate and consumer loans. The decline in BankAtlantic&#146;s
non-interest income was primarily due to lower net assessments of overdraft fees. BankAtlantic
non-interest expenses, excluding the goodwill impairment charge, declined by $31.6&nbsp;million
primarily due to management&#146;s expense reduction initiatives.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company segment loss during 2009 compared to 2008
reflects a $6.0&nbsp;million reduction in the provision for loan losses and $4.9&nbsp;million of reduced net
interest expense. The provision for loan losses for both years was associated with
non-performing loans acquired from BankAtlantic in March&nbsp;2008. The 2009 provision for loan losses
represents additional charge-offs and specific reserves associated with these loans due to
declining real estate collateral values. The improvement in net interest expense reflects
historically low LIBOR interest rates during 2009. The majority of BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent
Company&#146;s debt is indexed to the three-month LIBOR interest rate. The decline in interest rates
was partially offset by interest accrued on the junior subordinated debentures deferred interest.
BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company operating expenses were higher by $0.3&nbsp;million during 2009
compared to 2008. Lower property management costs associated with non-performing loans during 2009
were offset by higher compensation expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company segment loss during 2008 compared to 2007
reflects a provision for loan losses of $24.4&nbsp;million as well as the establishment of a $20.9
million deferred tax valuation allowance. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company had no provision for
loan losses during the comparable 2007 period as it held no loans during that period.
Additionally, gains from securities activities declined from $6.1&nbsp;million during 2007 to a loss of
$0.4&nbsp;million during 2008 as BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company liquidated its managed fund
investment portfolio and sold its entire investment in Stifel securities acquired by it in
connection with the 2007 sale of Ryan Beck. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company operating expenses
were higher by $4.5&nbsp;million during 2008 compared to 2007. The increase reflects property
management costs associated with non-performing loans and an increase in professional fees in 2008
compared to 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2009 and 2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company recognized in discontinued
operations $3.7&nbsp;million and $16.6&nbsp;million, respectively, of additional proceeds from the sale of
Ryan Beck in connection with contingent earn-out payments under the Ryan Beck merger agreement with
Stifel. Included in discontinued operations during 2007 relating to the Ryan Beck segment was
income of $7.8&nbsp;million. Ryan Beck&#146;s 2007 segment income reflects a $16.4&nbsp;million gain from the
sale of Ryan Beck to Stifel partially offset by an $8.6&nbsp;million loss from operations during the two
months ended February&nbsp;28, 2007, the closing date of the sale to Stifel.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following events over the past several years have had a significant impact on
BankAtlantic&#146;s results of operations:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2002, BankAtlantic launched its &#147;<I>Florida&#146;s Most Convenient Bank&#148; </I>initiative which
resulted in significant demand deposit, NOW checking and savings account growth (we refer to these
accounts as &#147;core deposit&#148; accounts). Since inception of this campaign, BankAtlantic has
increased core deposit balances from $600&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2001 to approximately $2.7
billion at December&nbsp;31, 2009. These core deposits represented 67% of BankAtlantic&#146;s total
deposits at December&nbsp;31, 2009, compared to 26% of total deposits at December&nbsp;31, 2001.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, BankAtlantic announced its de novo store expansion strategy and had opened 32 stores
as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 in connection with this strategy. BankAtlantic&#146;s non-interest expenses
substantially increased as a result of the hiring of additional personnel, increased marketing to
support new stores, increased leasing and operating costs for the new stores and expenditures for
back-office technologies to support a larger institution.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2005, the growth in core deposits slowed reflecting rising
short-term interest rates and increased competition among financial institutions. In response to
these market conditions, BankAtlantic significantly increased its marketing expenditures and
continued its new store expansion program in an effort to sustain core deposit growth. The number
of new core deposit accounts opened increased from 226,000 during 2005 to 270,000 during 2006,
while core deposit balances grew to $2.2&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2006 from $2.1&nbsp;billion at
December&nbsp;31, 2005. In response to adverse economic conditions and the slowed deposit growth,
BankAtlantic significantly reduced its marketing expenditures beginning during the fourth quarter
of 2006 as part of an overall effort to reduce its non-interest expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the latter half of 2007, the real estate markets deteriorated rapidly throughout the
United States, and particularly in Florida where BankAtlantic&#146;s commercial and consumer real
estate loans are concentrated. In response to these market conditions, BankAtlantic significantly
increased its allowance for loan losses for commercial loans collateralized by real estate
property and to a lesser extent home equity consumer loans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2007, the decision was made to delay BankAtlantic&#146;s retail
network expansion, consolidate certain back-office facilities and implement other initiatives to
reduce non-interest expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As economic conditions deteriorated in late 2007 and 2008, real estate property values
continued to decline. The adverse economic and real estate market conditions severely impacted
the credit quality of BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolio. In March&nbsp;2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent
Company purchased $101.5&nbsp;million of non-performing loans from BankAtlantic and during the year
contributed $65&nbsp;million of capital to BankAtlantic. During the fourth quarter of 2008, financial
and credit markets further experienced rapid deterioration, investor confidence in financial
institutions was significantly and adversely affected and the market capitalization of
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock declined materially. As BankAtlantic&#146;s non-performing
loans increased, additional loan loss reserves were established, impairments of long-lived assets
were recognized and earnings were adversely affected. As a consequence of the substantial losses
during 2007 and 2008, the deterioration in the price of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common
stock and the unprecedented economic and market uncertainty, BankAtlantic recognized a $48.3
million non-cash goodwill impairment charge and established $66.9&nbsp;million non-cash deferred tax
valuation allowance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2009, in response to the continued deteriorating economic conditions including falling
real estate collateral values and rising unemployment, and the significant adverse impact on the
credit quality of our assets and our results of operations, BankAtlantic reduced its assets,
repaid its wholesale borrowings and increased core deposits with a view towards strengthening its
liquidity and regulatory capital ratios. However, the credit quality of its loans continued to
deteriorate in 2009, and BankAtlantic&#146;s losses increased. As a result BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc.
contributed an additional $105&nbsp;million of capital to BankAtlantic. Additionally, as a consequence
of the adverse economic environment, an additional $22.5&nbsp;million of restructuring charges and
asset impairments were recognized during 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>For the Year Ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 Compared to the Same 2008 Period</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in net interest income primarily resulted from a significant reduction in earning
assets and an increase in non-performing assets partially offset by an improvement in the net
interest spread.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in average earning assets reflects a management decision to slow the origination
and purchase of loans, sell agency securities and reduce the purchase of tax certificates in an
effort to enhance liquidity and improve regulatory capital ratios. During 2009, BankAtlantic
slowed the origination of commercial and consumer loans and ceased the purchase of jumbo
residential loan portfolios. BankAtlantic concentrated its loan originations in small business and
middle market loans. As a consequence, average loans during 2009 declined by $344.4&nbsp;million
compared to 2008 with $295.5&nbsp;million of the average loan decline associated with the purchased
residential loan portfolio. BankAtlantic experienced significant residential loan repayments due
to the large volume of loan refinancings associated with historically low residential mortgage
interest rates during 2009. Taxable investment securities primarily consisted of agency
mortgage-backed securities and tax certificates. During 2009, BankAtlantic reduced the purchase of
tax certificates from $368.4&nbsp;million during 2008 to $65.7&nbsp;million during 2009 and sold $284&nbsp;million
of mortgage-backed securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net interest spread improved due to a change in our funding mix. BankAtlantic used the
funds from deposit growth and the reduction in assets to repay FHLB advances and short term
wholesale borrowings. BankAtlantic repaid $760&nbsp;million of FHLB advances during 2009 with an
average interest rate of 3.37%. As a consequence, BankAtlantic&#146;s funding mix changed from higher
rate FHLB advances to lower rate deposits. The interest earning asset yield declines were
primarily due to lower interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008, changes in the earning asset
portfolio mix and a significant increase in non-performing loans. The lower interest rate
environment during 2009 compared to 2008 had a significant impact on commercial, small business and
consumer loan yields, as a majority of these loans have adjustable interest rates indexed to prime
or LIBOR. The average prime interest rate declined from 8.05% at December&nbsp;31, 2007 to 3.25% at
December&nbsp;31, 2009, and the average three-month LIBOR interest rate declined from 5.30% at December
31, 2007 to 0.69% at December&nbsp;31, 2009. Additionally, average earning loan yields were adversely
affected by a significant increase in non-performing loans. Non-performing loans were $178.6
million at December&nbsp;31, 2007 compared to $286.1&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in interest bearing deposit rates reflects the lower interest rate environment and
an increase in NOW deposit accounts. The higher NOW accounts reflects a migration of retail time
deposits to NOW accounts as we believe the interest rates on NOW accounts were competitive with
time deposits for a significant portion of 2009. The increase in certificate accounts reflects
higher average brokered deposit account balances during 2009 compared to 2008. Deposits which
BankAtlantic receives in connection with its participation in the CDARS program from other
participating CDARS institutions are included in BankAtlantic&#146;s financial statements as brokered
deposits. Average brokered deposits increased from $81.5&nbsp;million during 2008 to $189.5&nbsp;million
during 2009, of which approximately 45% of average brokered deposits during 2009 consisted of CDARS
related deposits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management believes that the historically low interest rates during 2009 had a favorable
impact on our net interest margin. Conversely, increases in interest rates or continued reductions
in earning assets may result in further declines in our net interest margin.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>For the Year Ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 Compared to the Same 2007 Period</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in tax equivalent net interest income primarily resulted from a 17 basis point
decline in the net interest margin and secondarily from a shift in the deposit mix resulting in
lower non-interest bearing liabilities balances.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in the tax equivalent net interest margin primarily resulted from a decline in
average non-interest bearing demand deposit balances partially offset by an improvement in the tax
equivalent net interest spread. The increase in the tax equivalent net interest spread primarily
resulted from rates on interest-bearing liabilities adjusting to the decline in short-term interest
rates faster than interest-earning asset yields. The majority of our loans adjust to LIBOR or
prime interest rates indices. The average prime interest rate declined from 8.05% during the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 to 5.30% during the 2008&nbsp;year and the average three-month LIBOR rate
declined from 5.04%
during the 2007&nbsp;year to 2.92% during the 2008&nbsp;year. The majority of interest-bearing
liabilities adjust to current market rates faster than a significant portion of our assets, which
includes residential loans and mortgage-backed securities that only adjust periodically to current
market rates. The additional net interest income associated with the improvement of the net
interest spread was partially offset by average interest bearing liabilities increasing while
average interest-earning assets declined. Average interest earning assets were $79.0&nbsp;million lower,
and while overall average interest-bearing liabilities were $53.7&nbsp;million higher, non-interest
bearing demand deposit accounts were $117.5&nbsp;million lower. The decline in average non-interest
bearing demand deposit accounts reflected the competitive banking environment in Florida during
2008 and the migration of demand deposit accounts to interest-bearing NOW accounts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest income on earning assets declined $63.0&nbsp;million during 2008 as compared to 2007. The
decline was primarily due to the impact that lower interest rates during 2008 had on our average
yields for consumer, commercial and small business loans. Residential loan yields during 2008
remained at 2007 levels as the majority of our residential loans do not adjust annually and
prepayment speeds slowed, in part we believe, due to borrowers&#146; inability to refinance existing
loans at the current lower interest rates. The decline in taxable securities yields mainly
resulted from the liquidation of our tax exempt securities portfolio during the fourth quarter of
2007 and suspension by the FHLB of its stock dividend during the third quarter of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the slowing economy and declining real estate market, we slowed the origination
of commercial real estate loans and the purchase of residential loans during 2008. As a
consequence, average balances in our residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios
declined from $3.6&nbsp;billion during 2007 to $3.3&nbsp;billion during 2008. These declines in loan
balances were partially offset by an increase in our taxable securities, and small business loan
and consumer home equity loan average balances. Aggregate average balances in our consumer home
equity and small business loan portfolios increased due primarily to funding on existing lines of
credit for home equity loans and from the origination of small business loans. The higher average
taxable securities balances reflects a $57.5&nbsp;million increase in tax certificate average balances
as 2008 tax certificate acquisitions were higher than 2007 acquisitions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in deposit rates primarily resulted from the lower interest rate environment
during 2008 compared to 2007. The decline in interest rates generally was offset in part by a
shift in deposit mix from demand deposit accounts to NOW accounts and from savings to certificate
accounts. The decline in savings account average balances reflects outflows of high yield savings
accounts as certain competitors offered higher interest rates. The migration from demand deposit
accounts to NOW accounts primarily resulted from a high yield checking account that we promoted
during 2008. The increase in certificates accounts reflects higher average brokered deposit
account balances as well as high yield certificate account promotions during 2008. Brokered
deposits increased from $14.7&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2007 to $239.9&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rates on wholesale borrowings during 2008 were significantly lower than 2007 reflecting a
significant decline in the federal funds rates during 2008. The average federal funds rate
declined from 5.04% during 2007 to 2.09% during 2008. Additionally, we were able to borrow at
historically low interest rates due to programs implemented by the Treasury to stimulate the
economy through increased funding to financial institutions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to improve the net interest margin and lower borrowing costs in subsequent periods,
BankAtlantic prepaid $692&nbsp;million of FHLB advances during the fourth quarter of 2008. BankAtlantic
funded the advance repayments with short term borrowings that were at significantly lower interest
rates than the repaid advances.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in net interest income during 2009 was primarily due to the decline in average
earning assets and secondarily due to the decline in average yields on earning assets. Average
earning assets declined by $790.6&nbsp;million, reducing net income by $39.3&nbsp;million. Average
interest-bearing liabilities declined by $781.8&nbsp;million, reducing interest expense by $23.1
million. The lower yields on total earning assets reduced interest income by $50.9&nbsp;million while
declines in interest rates on total interest bearing liabilities reduced interest expense by $36.8
million. As discussed above, the lower yields on interest earning assets reflect the effect on our
loan portfolio interest income of the significant decline during 2009 of LIBOR and prime interest
rate indices.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in tax equivalent net interest income during 2008 was largely due to yields on
interest earning assets declining faster than interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities. The
lower yields on total earning assets reduced interest income by $77.5&nbsp;million while declines in
interest rates on total interest bearing liabilities reduced interest expense by $54.1&nbsp;million. As
discussed above, the lower yields on interest earning assets reflect the effect on our loan
portfolio interest income of the significant decline during 2008 of LIBOR and prime interest rate
indices. The decline in federal funds rates and the programs implemented by the Treasury to
promote lending by financial institutions significantly lowered wholesale borrowing interest rates.
However, interest rate declines on our deposits were less than our earning asset yield declines as
interest rates on our low cost deposits are not as sensitive to interest rate changes as our loan
portfolio rates. Further competition from other financial institutions resulted in only a gradual
decline in certificate account interest rates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year-over-year increases in the provision for loan losses and charge-offs for 2007, 2008
and 2009 compared to the prior periods resulted primarily from the rapid decline in real estate
values nationally and in Florida, the substantial downturn in the homebuilding industry and the
deteriorating economic environment that began in 2007. BankAtlantic has a high concentration of
commercial borrowers in the homebuilding industry and the majority of its residential and consumer
home equity loans are to retail customers. The ability of these retail customers to repay their
loans is adversely affected by rising unemployment rates. In December&nbsp;2009, the national
unemployment rate rose to 10% and the Florida unemployment rate more than doubled from 4.1% at
December&nbsp;31, 2007 to 7.6% at December&nbsp;31, 2008 to 11.8% at December&nbsp;31, 2009. Rising national
unemployment has resulted in higher delinquencies and foreclosures on residential real estate
loans, including the jumbo residential loans which comprise the majority of our residential loan
portfolio. We believe rising unemployment and declining property values have resulted in higher
credit losses. The declines in the value of real estate, which initially involved primarily
residential real estate but are now being experienced in the commercial non-residential real estate
markets, have exacerbated our credit losses as the underlying collateral values of our loans have
continued to decline throughout the three year period. The recession, falling real estate values
and high unemployment are adversely affecting residential and commercial non-residential real
estate markets. BankAtlantic believes that its commercial borrowers are experiencing difficulties
selling real estate inventory or maintaining current cash flow levels on rental real estate
properties. We believe that if real estate and general economic conditions and unemployment trends
in Florida do not improve, the credit quality of our loan portfolio will continue to deteriorate
and we would expect an increase in loan delinquencies and non-accrual loan balances as well as
additional provisions for loan losses in future periods. Additionally, if jumbo residential loan
delinquencies and foreclosures continue to increase nationwide, additional provisions for losses in
our residential loan portfolio may be required.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continued to incur losses in our commercial residential real estate and consumer home
equity loan portfolios. We also began experiencing higher losses during 2009 in our commercial
non-residential, residential and small business loan portfolios as the deteriorating economic
environment has adversely impacted these borrowers. In response to these trends, we have
significantly reduced purchases of residential loans and tightened consumer home equity loan
underwriting requirements for new loans and froze certain borrowers&#146; home equity loan commitments
where borrowers&#146; current credit scores were significantly lower than at the date of loan
origination or where current collateral values were substantially lower than at loan origination.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the increase in charge-offs trends of commercial real estate, consumer home
equity and residential loans during the three year period ending December&nbsp;31, 2009 primarily
reflects the significant increase in unemployment and declining real estate values. The
significant increase in commercial real estate loan charge-offs primarily resulted from our
commercial residential development loans and secondarily from our commercial non-residential real
estate loans. The majority of the commercial residential development loan charge-offs during 2009
were from updated loan collateral fair value estimates reflecting the continued deterioration in
the Florida residential real estate market. We are hopeful that charge-offs and non-performing
commercial residential loans may have peaked and may decline in future periods due to significant
reductions in outstanding balances from December&nbsp;2008 to December&nbsp;2009; however, this may not be
the case and there is no assurance that we will not experience the same or higher levels of
charge-offs and non-accrual loans in this category. With respect to commercial nonresidential
loans we expect that charge-offs in commercial non-residential loans may escalate if market
conditions do not improve or deteriorate further. The increasing levels of small business
charge-offs during the three year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, we believe, reflects the
deteriorating financial condition of our borrowers&#146; businesses caused, in part, by reduced
consumer spending and the depressed real estate industry.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-performing assets were substantially higher at December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 compared
to the prior two years. The increase in non-performing assets during 2006 compared to 2005
resulted from a repossessed commercial real estate property during 2006. This property was further
impaired by $7.2&nbsp;million during 2007 and $3.1&nbsp;million during 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in non-accrual loans during the three year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2009
reflects the general deterioration in the national and Florida economy, high unemployment, and the
depressed residential real estate market as home prices throughout the country and in Florida
continued to decline and it is taking longer than historical time-frames to foreclose on and sell
homes. Residential mortgage delinquencies were at record highs nationally during the fourth quarter
of 2009. Non-accrual commercial and small business loans increased primarily due to the
deteriorating financial condition of certain of our borrowers which we believe is the result of
Florida&#146;s depressed economy and a
reduction in consumer spending associated with high unemployment. The increase in commercial
real estate non-accrual loans during the three year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 reflects the
migration of commercial residential loans to a non-accrual classification as well as weaknesses in
the commercial non-residential market during 2009 resulting in an increase in troubled shopping
center and office building loans. Commercial non-accrual loans at December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 were
favorably impacted by transferring $101.5&nbsp;million of non-accrual commercial loans to a work-out
subsidiary of BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company in March&nbsp;2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher repossessed assets balances at December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to prior periods reflect
increased foreclosures of commercial real estate and residential loans. BankAtlantic attempts to
modify loans to credit worthy borrowers; however, the majority of BankAtlantic&#146;s non-accrual
commercial real estate loans are collateral dependent resulting in BankAtlantic having few viable
alternatives other than initiating the foreclosure process. We also initiate the foreclosure
process on non-accrual residential loans upon unsuccessful loan modification attempts. As a
consequence of the increasing non-accrual loans, we expect repossessed assets to significantly
increase in the foreseeable future.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s potential problem loans at December&nbsp;31, 2009 have significantly increased
compared to prior periods primarily due to an increase in troubled debt restructured loans. In
response to current market conditions, BankAtlantic has developed loan modification programs for
certain borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009,
BankAtlantic modified the terms of certain commercial, small business, residential and consumer
home equity loans. Generally, the concessions made to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulties were the reduction of the loan&#146;s contractual interest rate, conversion of amortizing
loans to interest only payments or the deferral of interest payments to the maturity date of the
loan. Loans that are not delinquent at the date of modification are generally not placed on
non-accrual. Modified non-accrual loans are not returned to an accruing status and BankAtlantic
does not reset days past due on delinquent modified loans until the borrower demonstrates a
sustained period of performance under the modified terms, which is generally performance over a six
month period. However, there is no assurance that the modification of loans will result in
increased collections from the borrower or that modified loans which return to an accruing status
will not subsequently return to nonaccrual status.

real estate loans; however, BankAtlantic is experiencing unfavorable credit quality trends in
commercial loans collateralized by commercial land and retail income producing properties and may
experience higher non-performing loans in these loan categories in future periods. BankAtlantic&#146;s
commercial loan portfolio includes large loan balance lending relationships. Seven relationships
account for 50% of our $167.9&nbsp;million of non-accrual commercial real estate loans as of December
31, 2009. The following table outlines general information about these relationships as of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loans that comprise the above relationships are all collateral dependent. As such, we
established specific reserves or recognized partial charge-offs on these loans based on our
determination of the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. The fair value of the
collateral was determined using unadjusted third party appraisals for all relationships.
BankAtlantic performs quarterly impairment analyses on these credit relationships and may reduce
appraised values if market conditions significantly deteriorate subsequent to the appraisal date.
However, BankAtlantic&#146;s policy is to obtain a full appraisal within one year from the date of the
prior appraisal, unless the loan is in the process of foreclosure. A new appraisal is obtained at
the date of foreclosure.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our residential loan portfolio does not include negative amortization, option ARM or subprime
products; however, the majority of our residential loans are purchased residential jumbo loans and
certain of these loans could potentially have outstanding loan balances significantly higher than
related collateral values as a result of real estate value declines in the housing markets.
Additionally, loans that were originated during 2005, 2006 and 2007 have experienced greater
deterioration in collateral value than loans originated in prior years resulting in higher loss
experiences in these groups of loans. Also, California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada are states
that have experienced especially elevated foreclosures and delinquency rates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our purchased residential loan portfolio includes interest-only loans. The terms of these
loans provide for possible future increases in a borrower&#146;s loan payments when the contractually
required repayments increase due to interest rate changes and the required amortization of the
principal amount begins. These payment increases could affect a borrower&#146;s ability to meet the
debt service on or repay the loan and lead to increased defaults and losses which could result in
additional provisions for residential loan losses.

classifications (&#147;Allowance for Loan Losses&#148;), the percent of allowance to each loan category (&#147;ALL
to gross loans percent&#148;) and the percentage of loans in each category to gross loans (&#147;Loans to
gross loans percent&#148;). The allowance shown in the table should not be interpreted as an indication
that charge-offs in future periods will occur in these amounts or percentages or that the allowance
accurately reflects future charge-off amounts or trends (dollars in thousands):

<DIV align="right" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">&nbsp;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residential real estate and home equity consumer loans that are 120&nbsp;days past due were
generally written down to estimated collateral value less costs to sell. As a consequence of
longer than historical timeframes to foreclose and
sell residential real estate and the rapid decline in residential real estate values where our
collateral is located, BankAtlantic began performing quarterly impairment evaluations during 2009
on residential real estate and real estate secured consumer loans that were written down in prior
periods to determine whether specific reserves were necessary for further estimated market value
declines. BankAtlantic also may establish specific reserves on loans that are individually
evaluated for impairment (generally commercial and small business loans). The significant increase
in commercial loan specific reserves reflects declines in collateral values as of December&nbsp;31,
2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial real estate loans account for the majority of the allowance for loan losses for
each of the years in the five year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. The commercial real estate loan
allowance as of December&nbsp;31, 2005 primarily reflected allowance for loan losses based on increases
or decreases in high balance loans. The increase in the allowance for commercial real estate loans
during 2006 was associated with a slow-down in the homebuilding industry. The substantial increase
in the commercial real estate allowance for loan losses during 2007, 2008 and 2009 resulted in
large part from a rapid and prolonged deterioration in the Florida real estate market, generally
and the significant downturn in the residential real estate market nationally. During 2008 and
2007, home sales and median home prices declined significantly on a year-over-year basis in all
major metropolitan areas in Florida, with conditions deteriorating rapidly during the fourth
quarter of 2008 in response to the overall loss of confidence in the financial markets. The
housing industry was experiencing a dramatic downturn and market conditions in the housing industry
continued to worsen throughout 2008 reflecting, in part, decreased availability of mortgage
financing for residential home buyers, reduced demand for new construction resulting in a
significant over-supply of housing inventory, and increased foreclosure rates. During 2009, the
decline in median home prices slowed and medium to low priced home sales began to recover from the
2008 lows. However, we believe that a portion of the increased sales and slow down of price
declines may have been attributable to low mortgage interest rates and the impact of the first-time
home buyer tax credits and may not be sustainable. Also, during 2009 we began experiencing higher
levels of commercial non-residential real estate classified assets and charge-offs resulting from
declining real estate values and financial difficulties of our borrowers who experienced reduced
cash flows from declining rental income. Accordingly, the allowance for loan losses for commercial
real estate loans was increased to reflect higher estimated losses for this loan product as the
current economic and market conditions have resulted in unfavorable delinquency trends. We believe
that the loss severities associated with these loans may be less significant than our commercial
residential development loans as the underlying collateral associated with these loans is generally
income producing. However, if economic conditions do not improve, there is no assurance that we
will not experience significantly increased delinquencies and charge-offs in our commercial
non-residential loan portfolio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three categories of loans in our commercial residential development loan portfolio
that have resulted in the majority of losses in our commercial real estate loan portfolio. The
loan balance in these categories aggregated $226.9&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009. These categories
are as follows:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &#147;builder land bank loan&#148; category consists of 7 loans and aggregates $43.7&nbsp;million
at December&nbsp;31, 2009. This category consists of land loans to borrowers who have or had
land purchase option agreements with regional and/or national builders. These loans were
originally underwritten based on projected sales of the developed lots to the
builders/option holders, and timely repayment of the loans is primarily dependent upon the
sale of the property pursuant to the options. If the lots are not sold as originally
anticipated, BankAtlantic anticipates that the borrower may not be in a position to service
the loan, with the likely result being an increase in nonperforming loans and loan losses in
this category. The number of homebuilders who have publicly announced that they are, or
are contemplating, terminating these options or seeking bankruptcy protection substantially
increases the risk that the lots will not be acquired as contemplated. Six loans in this
category totaling $42.6&nbsp;million were on non-accrual at December&nbsp;31, 2009. BankAtlantic
established $23.2&nbsp;million of specific reserves on these loans as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &#147;land acquisition and development loan&#148; category consists of 27 loans and
aggregates $171.9&nbsp;million and generally consists of loans secured by residential land which
is intended to be developed by the borrower and sold to homebuilders. These loans are
generally underwritten more stringently than builder land bank loans, as an option agreement
with a regional or national builder did not exist at the origination date. Ten loans in
this category totaling $60.2&nbsp;million were on non-accrual at December&nbsp;31, 2009. BankAtlantic
established $7.1&nbsp;million of specifics reserves on these loans as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &#147;land acquisition, development and construction loan&#148; category consists of 6 loans
and aggregates $11.3&nbsp;million. This category generally consists of loans secured by
residential land which will be
fully developed by the borrower who may also construct homes on the property. These
loans generally involve property with a longer investment and development horizon, are
guaranteed by the borrower or individuals and/or are secured by additional collateral or
equity such that it is expected that the borrower will have the ability to service the debt
for a longer period of time. One loan in this category totaling $3.8&nbsp;million was on
non-accrual at December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic during 2009 experienced heightened delinquencies and charge-offs associated with
commercial non-residential land loans and commercial non-residential loans. At December&nbsp;31, 2009,
BankAtlantic had 30 commercial land loans totaling $88.5&nbsp;million with 7 non-accrual loans totaling
$32.2&nbsp;million, and 158 commercial non-residential loans totaling $549.9&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31,
2009 with 12 loans on non-accrual totaling $27.8&nbsp;million. Commercial land loans consist of loans
to acquire non-residential land or loans to acquire and develop a site for non-residential
commercial construction. The borrower generally sells the developed site to developers or obtains
permanent financing from other lenders to complete the development of the property. Commercial
non-residential loans generally represent permanent financing for income producing properties and
financing for the construction of income producing properties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance for consumer loans has increased for each of the years in the five year period
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. This increase during 2005 and 2006 was largely associated with the growth
in outstanding home equity loans throughout the period and the change in policy during 2004 to
permit higher loan-to-value ratio loans based on Beacon scores. The increase in the allowance for
loan losses for consumer loans during 2007 compared to 2006 reflects unfavorable home equity loan
delinquency trends, higher non-performing home equity loans and a significant increase in
charge-offs during the fourth quarter of 2007. The significant increase in the allowance for
consumer loan losses during 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to a significant increase in
consumer home equity loan charge-offs, higher non-performing loans and adverse delinquency trends.
The adverse delinquency trends continued during 2009 as residential property values in Florida
continued to decline.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance for residential loan losses increased during 2006 compared to 2005 primarily
associated with higher loan balances. During 2007, the allowance was maintained at 2006 levels as
the portfolio experienced minimal credit losses and no adverse delinquency trends. During 2008, as
property values nationwide declined and unemployment rates increased, our residential loan
portfolio began experiencing unfavorable delinquency trends and increased charge-offs. These
unfavorable delinquency trends accelerated throughout 2009. Jumbo residential loan credit trends
for loans originated in 2005, 2006 and 2007 significantly deteriorated during 2009 and losses on
prime credit quality jumbo residential loans out-paced losses on other prime based loans. As a
consequence of these adverse trends, the residential allowance for loan losses significantly
increased at December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to the same 2008 and 2007 periods. During 2009,
residential loan delinquencies continued to increase and modified residential loans are expected to
re-default at a high rate, which should result in continued high foreclosure rates. The
anticipated resetting during 2010 of option adjustable rate mortgages held by other institutions is
also expected to increase foreclosure rates. Residential home prices are forecasted to decline in
most markets during 2010 with the worst forecasted declines in the Arizona, California, Florida and
Nevada markets. A decline in residential home prices during 2010 may also result in additional
delinquencies and losses in our commercial residential real estate portfolio in subsequent periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance for small business loan losses increased during 2006 compared to 2005 primarily
associated with higher loan balances. During 2007, the allowance was maintained at 2006 levels as
delinquency trends and credit losses remained at 2006 levels. As economic conditions worsened
during the latter half of 2008, we began experiencing adverse trends and higher credit losses in
our small business loan portfolio. In response to these adverse trends we increased the small
business allowance for loan losses by 78% at December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared to December&nbsp;31, 2007.
During 2009, the small business allowance for loan losses was maintained at 2008 levels as we have
seen a recent stabilization of delinquencies and charge-offs trends; however, there is no assurance
that these trends will continue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in Item&nbsp;1A. Risk Factors under Financial Services and elsewhere in this annual
report on Form 10-K, in the event of a sustained decline in real estate markets, and residential
real estate in particular, and a sustained slowdown in the economy in general, we may experience
further deterioration in the credit quality and performance of our loan portfolio. As a
consequence, if conditions do not improve, we will experience an increase in levels of
non-performing assets and these increases will likely be experienced across various loan
categories.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower revenues from service charges on deposits during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009
compared to the same 2008 period primarily resulted from lower overdraft fee income. This decrease
in overdraft fee income reflects a decline in the total number of accounts which incurred
overdraft fees and a decrease in the frequency of overdrafts per deposit account. We believe
that the decline in the number of accounts incurring overdraft fees is primarily the result of our
focus on targeting customers who maintain deposit accounts with higher balances and secondarily
the result of a change in customer behavior in response to the current adverse economic
environment. The Federal Reserve has recently adopted new overdraft rules effective July&nbsp;1, 2010
prohibiting banks from automatically enrolling customers in overdraft protection programs.
Additionally, Congress has proposed legislation to further limit the assessment of overdraft fees.
This legislation and current public focus on overdraft fees may alter customer behavior and
further reduce our overdraft fee income in subsequent periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower revenue from service charges on deposits during 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily
due to lower overdraft fee income. This decline in overdraft fees primarily resulted from lower
net overdraft assessments and more stringent criteria for allowing customer overdrafts in response
to increasing check losses. Also contributing to reduced fee income during 2008 was a decline in
new deposit account openings resulting, in part, from a management decision to reduce overall
marketing and advertising expenses and the competitive deposit gathering environment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slight increase in other service charges and fees during 2009 compared to 2008 was
primarily due to higher fees associated with a new vendor contract and an increase in cruise ship
surcharge income associated with an increased number of automated teller machines (&#147;ATM&#148;) on cruise
ships.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other service charges and fees during 2008 remained at 2007 levels as higher ATM fees from
cruise ships was offset by lower debit card transaction volume. Also, the decline in the number of
new deposit account openings during 2008 resulted in lower service charge fees.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Securities activities, net during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 includes $11.2&nbsp;million of
gains from the sales of $284.0&nbsp;million of agency securities. The net proceeds from the sales of
securities were used to pay down FHLB advances.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Securities activities, net during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 includes $1.0&nbsp;million of
gains from the sale of MasterCard International stock obtained in MasterCard&#146;s initial public
offering in September&nbsp;2006. Additionally, BankAtlantic sold $210.4&nbsp;million of agency securities
and realized gains of $0.9&nbsp;million. BankAtlantic also recognized gains of $0.4&nbsp;million in
connection with the execution of covered calls on its agency securities portfolio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Securities activities, net during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 includes $3.4&nbsp;million of
gains from the sale of MasterCard International stock. This gain was partially offset by $1.6
million of realized losses from the sale of $399.2&nbsp;million of municipal securities and $105.8
million of agency securities available for sale. The municipal securities were sold because the
lower tax-free returns on these securities were not beneficial to BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent
Company in light of the losses incurred during 2007 and the agency securities were sold in
response to changes in market interest rates and related changes in the securities&#146; prepayment
risk.

million and $0.2&nbsp;million, respectively, of equity earnings in a joint venture that factors
receivables. Income from unconsolidated subsidiaries for 2008 and 2007 also includes $1.0&nbsp;million

of stores and the consolidation of back-office facilities.

were primarily from the sale of residential loans originated with the assistance of independent
mortgage brokers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in other non-interest income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to
the same 2008 period was primarily the result of higher commissions earned on the sale of
investment products to BankAtlantic&#146;s customers. Commissions from the sales of investment
products for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $4.0&nbsp;million, $2.1&nbsp;million and
$0.7&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in other non-interest income for 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily the result
of $1.4&nbsp;million of higher commissions earned on the sale of investment products to customers and a
$1.1&nbsp;million write-off of leasehold improvements associated with the relocation of stores and the
consolidation of back-office facilities. This increase in other non-interest income was partially
offset by a $1.1&nbsp;million decline in fee income from the outsourcing of our check clearing
operation as low short-term interest rates reduced our earnings credit on outstanding checks.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s non-interest expense for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $258.8&nbsp;million, $330.6&nbsp;million
and $313.9&nbsp;million, respectively. Excluding $29.9&nbsp;million, $59.6&nbsp;million and $20.9&nbsp;million of
impairments, restructuring charges and costs associated with debt redemptions, BankAtlantic&#146;s
non-interest expense would have been $228.9&nbsp;million,
$271.1&nbsp;million and $293.0&nbsp;million, for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The reduction in
non-interest expense during the three year period reflects management&#146;s efforts to reduce expenses
and increase operating efficiencies. In response to the adverse economic environment, we delayed
our store expansion program, consolidated certain back-office facilities, sold five central Florida
stores, renegotiated vendor contracts, continued staff reductions, out-sourced certain back-office
functions and initiated other targeted expense reduction programs. Management is continuing to
explore opportunities to further reduce operating expenses and increase operating efficiencies;
however, there is no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial decline in employee compensation and benefits during each of the years in the
three year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 resulted primarily from workforce reductions in March
2007, April&nbsp;2008 and March&nbsp;2009, normal attrition, as well as declines in personnel related to
the implementation in December&nbsp;2007 of reduced store lobby and call center hours. In March&nbsp;2007,
BankAtlantic reduced its work force by 225 associates, or 8%; in April&nbsp;2008, BankAtlantic reduced
its work force by 124 associates, or 6%; and in March&nbsp;2009, BankAtlantic&#146;s workforce was further
reduced by 130 associates, or 7%. As a consequence of the work force reductions and normal
attrition, the number of full-time equivalent employees declined from 2,618 at December&nbsp;31, 2006
to 1,538 at December&nbsp;31, 2009, or 41%, while the store network expanded from 88 stores at December
31, 2006 to 100 stores at December&nbsp;31, 2009. The decline in the work force resulted in lower
employee benefits, payroll taxes and recruitment advertising. Also contributing to the decline in
compensation, was the discontinuation of the 401(k) Plan employer match and the employee profit
sharing plan. Costs associated with these benefit Plans were $0.7&nbsp;million, $4.9&nbsp;million and $4.9
million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The substantial
reduction in the workforce as well as the related decrease in employee benefits was partially
offset during 2009 by higher pension costs associated with BankAtlantic&#146;s frozen defined benefit
plan. BankAtlantic recognized pension income of $0.2&nbsp;million for each of the years in the two
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and pension expense of $2.0&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2009. Share-based compensation expense was $2.0&nbsp;million, $1.2&nbsp;million and $3.3&nbsp;million during the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. BankAtlantic Bancorp did not grant
share based awards to employees during 2009 and 2008 and reversed prior period share based
compensation expense as the forfeiture rate on outstanding options was increased from 18% to 40%
reflecting the significant reduction in the workforce throughout the three year period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in occupancy and equipment during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to
the 2008&nbsp;year primarily resulted from the consolidation of back-office facilities, the
renegotiation of vendor contracts and the sale of five central Florida branches during the second
quarter of 2008. As a consequence of these actions, rent expense declined by $1.8&nbsp;million,
depreciation expense by $2.4&nbsp;million and maintenance costs by $2.1&nbsp;million for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to the 2008&nbsp;year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occupancy and equipment expenses for 2008 declined slightly from 2007. During the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic consolidated two call center operations into one call center in
Orlando, Florida, sold five central Florida stores to an unrelated financial institution,
terminated certain back-office lease agreements and renegotiated various vendor contracts. The
above expense reduction actions were partially offset by higher depreciation and real estate tax
expenses associated with the 2007 store network expansion initiatives.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher professional fees for 2009 compared to 2008 were mainly associated with legal costs
in connection with loan modifications, commercial loan work-outs, class-action securities
litigation and tax certificate activities litigation. Management believes that these matters will
continue during 2010 and may result in elevated legal costs in future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher professional fees for 2008 compared to 2007 primarily resulted from increased legal
fees as well as higher supervisory and examination fees. The supervisory and exam fees related to
consulting fees in connection with a review of our commercial loan portfolio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic changed its advertising focus from
growing deposit account volume to enhancing BankAtlantic&#146;s relationship with customers. As a
result, BankAtlantic significantly reduced direct mail advertising and reduced gifts to customers
upon the opening of deposit accounts. Direct mail advertising and customer gift expenses declined
from $10.1&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 to $3.2&nbsp;million during the same 2009
period.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in advertising expenses for 2008 compared to 2007 primarily resulted from lower
promotional costs for store grand openings and a management decision to reduce overall marketing as
part of expense reduction initiatives. BankAtlantic opened 15 stores during 2007, 3 stores during
2008 and BankAtlantic did not open any stores during 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the substantial decline in check losses during each of the years in the three
year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 primarily related to more stringent overdraft policies
implemented during 2008 as well as lower volume of new account growth.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower telecommunication costs for each of the years in the three year period ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009 primarily resulted from switching to a new vendor on more favorable terms during
2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amortization of intangible assets consisted of the amortization of acquired core deposit
intangible assets, which are being amortized over an estimated life of ten years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs associated with debt redemptions were the result of prepayment penalties incurred
upon the prepayment of $760&nbsp;million and $692&nbsp;million of FHLB advances in 2009 and 2008. The
prepayments in 2009 and 2008 were part of an initiative to improve our liquidity and net interest
margin as short term borrowing interest rates were at historical lows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant increase in the provision for tax certificate losses during 2009 and 2008
compared to 2007 reflects higher charge-offs and increases in the allowance for tax certificate
losses primarily related to certificates acquired through bulk purchases in markets which are
now distressed. We ceased the bulk acquisition of tax certificates and our out-of-state tax
certificate portfolio has been reduced through redemptions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restructuring charges, impairments and exit activities during 2009 reflect a $2.1&nbsp;million
severance charge in connection with the March&nbsp;2009 workforce reduction, and $2.5&nbsp;million of asset
impairments and lease obligation costs associated with the decision to sell properties or terminate
leases in connection with the delay of our store expansion initiative.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restructuring charges, impairments and exit activities during 2008 reflect a $2.2&nbsp;million
severance charge in connection with the April&nbsp;2008 workforce reduction and $5.0&nbsp;million of asset
impairments and lease obligation costs. Also included in restructuring charges is a $0.3&nbsp;million
loss on the sale of five central Florida stores to an unrelated financial institution.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restructuring charges, impairments and exit activities during 2007 reflect the March&nbsp;2007
workforce reduction and impairment and lease obligation costs associated with our decision to delay
store expansion.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real estate held for sale consists of land acquired for branch expansion and a real estate
development acquired in connection with the acquisition of a financial institution during 2002.
During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, BankAtlantic recognized impairments on the
real estate development of $3.9&nbsp;million, $1.2&nbsp;million and $5.2&nbsp;million, respectively. During
2008, BankAtlantic sold all vertical construction associated with the real estate development, and
the remaining real estate inventory consists of developed and undeveloped lots. During 2009
BankAtlantic recognized $0.8&nbsp;million of impairments on land acquired for branch expansion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real estate owned impairments during 2009 resulted primarily from a $3.1&nbsp;million write-down
associated with a real estate development acquired during the fourth quarter of 2006 when
BankAtlantic took possession of the collateral securing a land acquisition and development loan and
secondarily, from write-downs of residential and tax certificate real estate owned. Impairment of
real estate owned during 2008 was primarily associated with properties in distressed markets
acquired through tax certificate activities. Real estate owned impairments during 2007 resulted
from the repossession of the land acquisition and development loan mentioned above.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic tests goodwill for potential impairment annually or during interim periods if
impairment indicators exist. Based on the results of an interim impairment evaluation, BankAtlantic
recorded an impairment charge of $9.1&nbsp;million during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009.
BankAtlantic performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September&nbsp;30, 2009 and determined
that its remaining goodwill of $13.1&nbsp;million in its capital services reporting unit was not
impaired, as the fair value of our capital services reporting unit exceeded the fair value of the
net
assets by $22.6&nbsp;million. If market conditions do not improve or deteriorate further,
BankAtlantic may recognize additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the results of a goodwill impairment evaluation during 2008, BankAtlantic recorded an
impairment charge of $48.3&nbsp;million. All goodwill in the amount of $31.0&nbsp;million relating to
BankAtlantic&#146;s commercial lending and all goodwill in the amount of $17.3&nbsp;million relating to
BankAtlantic&#146;s community banking reporting units was determined to be impaired. The impairments in
the community banking and commercial lending business units reflect the on-going negative trends in
the financial services industry affecting BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s market capitalization and the
credit quality of BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolios.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2008, the FDIC adopted a restoration plan to restore its insurance fund to a
predefined level. In June&nbsp;2009, the FDIC imposed a special assessment on all depository
institutions of five basis points on adjusted total assets. BankAtlantic&#146;s portion of the FDIC
depository institution special assessment was $2.4&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in other non-interest expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to
the same 2008 period relates to higher deposit insurance premiums. BankAtlantic&#146;s deposit
insurance premium was $8.6&nbsp;million, $2.8&nbsp;million and $0.5&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These higher deposit insurance premiums were partially offset
by lower general operating expenses during 2009 and 2008 related to management&#146;s expense
reduction initiatives.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher other expenses during 2008 compared to 2007 resulted primarily from a $2.3&nbsp;million
increase in BankAtlantic&#146;s deposit premium assessments as the credit held by BankAtlantic against
its deposit premium assessments relating back to the early 1990&#146;s was exhausted and BankAtlantic
began paying the full deposit premium during the second quarter of 2008. BankAtlantic also
incurred $3.3&nbsp;million of increased property maintenance costs associated with real estate owned and
non-performing loans. These increases in other expenses were partially offset by lower general
operating expenses directly related to management&#146;s expense reduction initiatives.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between the effective tax rate and the expected federal income tax rate of 35%
during 2009 was due primarily to a change in tax laws in November&nbsp;2009 that extended the net
operating loss carry back period for 2009 taxable losses from two years to five years resulting in
BankAtlantic recognizing a $31.7&nbsp;million income tax benefit. Due to BankAtlantic&#146;s recent history
of losses and the sustained deterioration in economic conditions, BankAtlantic maintains a deferred
tax valuation allowance for its entire amount of net deferred tax assets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between the effective tax rate and the expected federal income tax rate of 35%
during 2008 was primarily due to the disallowance of tax benefits associated with the current year
losses and net deferred tax assets as a result of the establishment of a deferred tax valuation
allowance.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference in the effective tax rate and the expected federal income tax rate during 2007
was primarily due to tax exempt income from municipal securities and benefits for state taxes due
to allocations of earnings or losses among various state tax jurisdictions. BankAtlantic&#146;s entire
portfolio of tax-exempt securities was sold during the fourth quarter of 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company interest on loans during 2009 and 2008 represented
interest income of $3.1&nbsp;million and $2.3&nbsp;million, respectively, on commercial business loans
acquired in a March&nbsp;2008 loan transfer from BankAtlantic. These loans were returned to an accrual
status during 2008 as the borrowers&#146; cash flow improved upon obtaining tenants for properties
serving as collateral.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest and dividend income on investments during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 was
comprised primarily of earnings from a BankAtlantic reverse repurchase agreement account and
dividends from an equity investment. Interest and dividend income on investments during each of
the years in the two year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 was comprised primarily of interest and
dividends associated with a portfolio of debt and equity securities managed by a money manager as
well as earnings from a reverse repurchase account with BankAtlantic. Earnings from the
BankAtlantic reverse repurchase account were $28,000, $0.2&nbsp;million and $0.3&nbsp;million, respectively,
during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The significant decline in interest and
dividends on investments during 2008 and 2009 compared to 2007 resulted from the liquidation of the
$54.2&nbsp;million managed investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest expense for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 represents interest
expense recognized on BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company&#146;s junior subordinated debentures. The
decline in interest expense during 2009 compared to 2008 reflects the historically low three month
LIBOR interest rates during 2009. The decline in
interest rates was partially offset by interest accrued on the junior subordinated debentures&#146;
deferred interest. As previously discussed, BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company has elected to
defer the payment of interest on all of its junior subordinated debentures, commencing with the
first quarter of 2009. BankAtlantic Bancorp is permitted under the terms of its obligations to
defer interest payments for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods. During the deferral period,
interest will continue to accrue on the debentures and on the accrued interest, and BankAtlantic
Bancorp will continue to recognize such deferred interest as interest expense in its financial
statements. As a consequence, BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company&#146;s junior subordinated debentures
average balances increased from $294.2&nbsp;million during 2008 to $300.0&nbsp;million during 2009. Average
interest rates on junior subordinated debentures decreased from 7.14% during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008 to 5.18% during the same 2009 period due to a decrease in LIBOR.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in interest expense during 2008 compared to 2007 resulted from lower average
interest rates in 2008 partially offset by higher average borrowings. Average interest rates on
outstanding junior subordinated debentures decreased from 8.29% during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2007 to 7.14% during the same 2008 period as a result of lower short-term interest rates during
2008 compared to 2007. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company&#146;s junior subordinated debentures
average balances were $294.2&nbsp;million during 2008 compared to $277.9&nbsp;million during the same 2007
period reflecting the issuance of $30.9&nbsp;million of junior subordinated debentures during 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income from unconsolidated subsidiaries during 2009, 2008 and 2007 represents $0.5&nbsp;million,
$0.6&nbsp;million and $0.7&nbsp;million, respectively, of equity earnings from trusts formed to issue trust
preferred securities and $0.6&nbsp;million of equity earnings in income producing real estate joint
ventures during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. The business purpose of the joint ventures was
to manage certain rental properties with the intent to sell the properties in the foreseeable
future. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company&#146;s joint ventures were liquidated and it does not
currently hold any interests in joint ventures.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company sold $54.2&nbsp;million of equity securities from
its managed investment portfolio, $108.4&nbsp;million of Stifel common stock and warrants to acquire
722,586 shares of Stifel common stock for a net gain of $4.2&nbsp;million. The majority of the $181.8
million of proceeds from the sale of securities and warrants was used to purchase $94.5&nbsp;million of
non-performing loans from BankAtlantic and to contribute $65&nbsp;million of capital to BankAtlantic.
BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company also recognized other-than-temporary impairment charges of $4.6
million associated with an investment in a private limited partnership and an equity investment in
a private placement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2007, BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company sold $49.5&nbsp;million of equity securities from
its managed investment portfolio for gains of $9.1&nbsp;million. The majority of the proceeds from the

stock. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company recognized $0.3&nbsp;million of unrealized gains from market
appreciation of Stifel warrants and recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $3.3&nbsp;million

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company&#146;s compensation expense during the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2009, 2008 and 2007 represents salaries, benefits and incentives for executive officers and
administrative personnel. The higher compensation expense during 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007
primarily reflects higher incentive performance bonuses during 2009. Compensation expense during
2008 also included a $0.6&nbsp;million reduction in share-based compensation as the forfeiture rate was
increased from 18% to 40% to reflect updated historical forfeiture experience. Share-based
compensation expense was $1.2&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 compared to $0.4&nbsp;million
and $0.6&nbsp;million during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008. Incentive performance bonuses
based on specific performance criteria were $2.9&nbsp;million, $0.6&nbsp;million and $0.5&nbsp;million during the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2009 and 2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company incurred higher professional fees
associated with the Securities and Exchange Commission formal investigation, the class-action
lawsuits and consulting fees associated with the recapitalization efforts. Also included in
professional fees during 2009 and 2008 were legal costs associated with servicing the
non-performing loans held in a work-out subsidiary of BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company.
Professional fees during 2007 were primarily legal costs for general corporate matters.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in other expenses during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 compared to
the same 2007 period reflects $0.9&nbsp;million and $2.5&nbsp;million, respectively, for property maintenance
costs for non-performing loans in the process of foreclosure. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company
also incurred $0.2&nbsp;million of loan servicing fees paid to BankAtlantic for each of the years in the
two year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 related to the loans held by its asset workout subsidiary.
Also included in other expenses for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $0.3
million, $0.3&nbsp;million and $0.4&nbsp;million, respectively, of fees paid to BFC for investor relations,
risk management and human resources services provided to BankAtlantic Bancorp by BFC.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company did not recognize a tax benefit in connection with its
2009 loss. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company recognized a provision for income taxes of $1.4
million in 2008 and an income tax benefit of $6.2&nbsp;million in 2007. These amounts represent
effective tax rates of 0%, 2.65% and 36.94% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The change in
BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company&#146;s effective tax rate during the periods was primarily due to
the disallowance of tax benefits associated with its 2009 and 2008 losses as a result of a deferred
tax valuation allowance established during 2008 on its net deferred tax assets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loans that comprise the above relationships are all collateral dependent. As such, we
established specific reserves or recognized partial charge-offs on these loans based on the fair
value of the collateral less costs to sell. The fair value of the collateral was determined using
unadjusted third party appraisals for all relationships. Management performs quarterly impairment
analyses on these credit relationships subsequent to the date of the appraisal and may reduce
appraised values if market conditions significantly deteriorate subsequent to the appraisal date.
However, our
policy is to obtain a full appraisal within one year from the date of the prior appraisal,
unless the loan is in the process of foreclosure. A full appraisal is obtained at the date of
foreclosure (in thousands).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for loan losses during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 resulted from
additional impairments on nonperforming commercial residential real estate loans and were due to
updated loan collateral fair value estimates reflecting the continued deterioration in the Florida
residential real estate market. As previously stated, if market conditions do not improve in the
Florida real estate market, additional provisions for loan losses and charge-offs may be required
in subsequent periods.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company&#146;s principal source of liquidity is its cash,
investments and funds obtained from its wholly-owned work-out subsidiary. BankAtlantic Bancorp
Parent Company also may obtain funds through dividends from its other subsidiaries, issuance of
equity and debt securities, and liquidation of its investments, although no dividends from
BankAtlantic are anticipated or contemplated in the foreseeable future. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent
Company has historically used its funds to contribute capital to its subsidiaries, pay debt service
and shareholder dividends, repay borrowings, invest in equity securities and other investments, and
fund operations, including funding servicing costs and real estate owned operating expenses of its
wholly-owned work-out subsidiary. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp had approximately
$308.3&nbsp;million of junior subordinated debentures outstanding with maturities ranging from 2032
through 2037. The aggregate annual interest obligations on this indebtedness totaled approximately
$13.4&nbsp;million based on interest rates at December&nbsp;31, 2009 and are generally indexed to three-month
LIBOR. In order to preserve liquidity in the current economic environment, BankAtlantic Bancorp
Parent Company elected in February&nbsp;2009 to defer interest payments on all of its outstanding junior
subordinated debentures and to cease paying cash dividends on its common stock. The terms of the
junior subordinated debentures and the trust documents allow BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company to
defer payments of interest for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods without default or penalty.
During the deferral period, the respective trusts have suspended the declaration and payment of
dividends on the trust preferred securities. The deferral election began as of March&nbsp;2009 and
regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments aggregating $14.1&nbsp;million that would otherwise have
been paid during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 were deferred. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent
Company has the ability under the junior subordinated debentures to continue to defer interest
payments through ongoing, appropriate notices to each of the trustees, and will make a decision
each quarter as to whether to continue the deferral of interest. During the deferral period,
interest will continue to accrue on the junior subordinated debentures at the stated coupon rate,
including on the deferred interest, and BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company will continue to record
the interest expense associated with the junior subordinated debentures. During the deferral
period, BankAtlantic Bancorp may not, among other things and with limited exceptions, pay cash
dividends on or repurchase its common stock nor make any payment on outstanding debt obligations
that rank equally with or junior to the junior subordinated debentures. BankAtlantic Bancorp
Parent Company may end the deferral by paying all accrued and unpaid interest. BankAtlantic
Bancorp Parent Company anticipates that it will continue to defer interest on its junior
subordinated debentures and will not pay dividends on its common stock for the foreseeable future.
If BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company continues to defer interest on its junior subordinated
debentures through the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, it will owe an aggregate of approximately $72
million of unpaid interest based on average interest rates as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected if
interest payments were deferred for a prolonged time period.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company did not receive
dividends from BankAtlantic. The ability of BankAtlantic to pay dividends or make other
distributions to BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company in subsequent periods is subject to
regulations and Office of Thrift Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;) approval and is based upon BankAtlantic&#146;s
regulatory capital levels and net income. Because BankAtlantic has an accumulated deficit during
the prior two years, BankAtlantic is required to file an application to receive approval of the OTS
in order to pay dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp. The OTS would not approve any distribution that
would cause BankAtlantic to fail to meet its capital requirements or if the OTS believes that a
capital distribution by BankAtlantic constitutes an unsafe or unsound action or practice and there
is no assurance that the OTS will approve future capital distributions from BankAtlantic.
BankAtlantic has not filed an application with the OTS for approval to pay a dividend since
September&nbsp;2008 and BankAtlantic Bancorp does not expect to receive cash dividends from BankAtlantic
during 2010, and possibly longer. However, BankAtlantic Bancorp may receive dividends from its
asset work-out subsidiary upon the monetizing of the subsidiaries&#146; non-performing loans.
Management can give no assurance that it will be able to monetize the loans in the foreseeable
future.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During January&nbsp;2010, BankAtlantic Bancorp commenced cash offers to purchase all outstanding
trust preferred securities having an aggregate principal amount of approximately $285&nbsp;million at a
purchase price of $200 per $1,000 liquidation amount, or an aggregate of $57&nbsp;million. During
February&nbsp;2010, the offer to purchase with respect to the approximate $55&nbsp;million of publicly traded
trust preferred securities issued by BBC Capital Trust II expired without any such trust preferred
securities being repurchased, while the expiration date for the offers to purchase relating to the
remaining $230&nbsp;million of trust preferred securities was extended until March&nbsp;22, 2010. The offers
to purchase are conditioned upon acceptance of the offers by holders of a sufficient amount of
trust preferred securities and upon BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s receipt of proceeds from a financing
transaction in amounts sufficient to purchase the trust preferred securities tendered. There is
no assurance that holders of a sufficient amount of trust preferred securities will accept
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s offers to purchase or that BankAtlantic Bancorp will purchase all or any of
the trust preferred securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;28, 2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp distributed to each record holder of its Class&nbsp;A
common stock and Class&nbsp;B common stock as of August&nbsp;24, 2009 non-transferable subscription rights to
purchase 4.441 shares of its Class&nbsp;A common stock for each share of Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B common
stock owned on that date. The subscription price was $2.00 per share and BankAtlantic Bancorp
completed the rights offering on September&nbsp;29, 2009 and issued 37,980,936 shares of its Class&nbsp;A
common stock to exercising shareholders. The net proceeds from this rights offering were $75.5
million, net of offering costs. It used the net proceeds to contribute $75&nbsp;million of capital to
BankAtlantic. While BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company and BankAtlantic had submitted
applications for the U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program funds during the fourth quarter of
2008, upon the completion of the rights offering in September&nbsp;2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp and
BankAtlantic withdrew their applications with the Treasury. During the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company contributed $105&nbsp;million of capital to BankAtlantic.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company may consider pursuing the issuance of additional
securities which could include Class&nbsp;A common stock, debt, preferred stock, warrants or any
combination thereof, to raise funds for the purchase of trusts preferred securities which may be
tendered to BankAtlantic Bancorp in the offers to purchase discussed above or for general corporate
purposes, including to provide capital to BankAtlantic and to fund operations. BankAtlantic
Bancorp Parent Company&#146;s operating expenses were $7.6&nbsp;million, $5.6&nbsp;million and $4.2&nbsp;million,
respectively, during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and its non-interest income
was $1.5&nbsp;million, $1.2&nbsp;million and $8.2&nbsp;million, respectively. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company
is required to provide BankAtlantic with managerial assistance and capital as the OTS may determine
necessary under applicable regulations and supervisory standards. Any such financing would be
sought through public or private offerings, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.
Additionally, financings could be pursued at the BankAtlantic Bancorp level or directly at
BankAtlantic or both. Any financing involving the issuance of BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;A common
stock or securities convertible or exercisable for BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock
could be highly dilutive for our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that any such
financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loans transferred to the wholly-owned work-out subsidiary of BankAtlantic Bancorp may also
provide a potential source of liquidity through workouts, repayments of the loans, sales of real
estate owned or sales of interests in the subsidiary. The balance of these loans and real estate
owned, net of reserves at December&nbsp;31, 2009 was $44.9&nbsp;million. During the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company received net cash of $3.7&nbsp;million from its work-out
subsidiary.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sale of Ryan Beck to Stifel closed on February&nbsp;28, 2007, and the sales agreement provided
for contingent earn-out payments, payable in cash or shares of Stifel common stock, at Stifel&#146;s
election, based on certain Ryan Beck revenues during the two-year period which ended on February
28, 2009. BankAtlantic Bancorp received its final earn-out payment of $8.6&nbsp;million paid in 250,233
shares of Stifel common stock in March&nbsp;2009. The Stifel stock was sold for net proceeds of $8.7
million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s primary sources of funds are deposits; principal repayments of loans, tax
certificates and securities available for sale; proceeds from the sale of loans and securities
available for sale; proceeds from securities sold under agreements to repurchase; advances from
FHLB; Treasury and Federal Reserve lending programs; interest payments on loans and securities;
capital contributions from BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company and other funds generated by
operations. These funds are primarily utilized to fund loan disbursements and purchases, deposit
outflows, repayments of securities sold under agreements to repurchase, repayments of advances
from FHLB and other borrowings, purchases of tax certificates and securities available for sale,
acquisitions of properties and equipment, and operating expenses. BankAtlantic&#146;s liquidity will
depend on its ability to generate sufficient cash to support loan demand, to meet deposit
withdrawals, and to pay operating expenses. BankAtlantic&#146;s securities portfolio provides an
internal source of liquidity through its short-term investments as well as scheduled maturities
and interest payments. Loan repayments and loan sales also provide an internal source of
liquidity. BankAtlantic&#146;s liquidity is also dependent, in part, on its ability to maintain or
increase deposit levels and availability under lines of credit and Treasury and Federal Reserve
lending programs. BankAtlantic&#146;s ability to increase or maintain deposits is impacted by
competition from other financial institutions and alternative investments as well as the current
low interest rate environment. Such competition or an increase in interest rates may require
BankAtlantic to offer higher interest rates to maintain or grow deposits, which may not be
successful in generating deposits, or which could increase its cost of funds or reduce its net
interest income. Additionally, BankAtlantic&#146;s current lines of credit may not be available when
needed as these lines of credit are subject to periodic review and may be terminated or reduced at
the discretion of the issuing institutions or reduced based on availability of qualifying
collateral. BankAtlantic&#146;s unused lines of credit declined from $986&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31,
2008 to $760&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 due to increases in FHLB line of credit collateral
requirements, reduction of lines of credit with financial institutions and the treasury as well as
reductions in available collateral due to the sale of mortgage-backed securities and lower loan
balances. Additionally, interest rate changes, additional collateral requirements, disruptions in
the capital markets or deterioration in BankAtlantic&#146;s financial condition may make borrowings
unavailable or make terms of the borrowings and deposits less favorable. As a result, there is a
risk that our cost of funds will increase or that borrowing capacity from funding sources may
decrease.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIC has announced that participating depository institutions may provide full deposit
insurance coverage for non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts and interest bearing
accounts with rates at or below fifty basis points, regardless of dollar amount. This new,
temporary guarantee was originally scheduled to expire at the end of
2009; however, in August&nbsp;2009, the FDIC extended the program until June&nbsp;30, 2010.
BankAtlantic &#147;opted-in&#148; to the additional coverage on the subject deposits. As a result,
BankAtlantic was assessed a 10-basis point surcharge for non-interest bearing deposit transaction
account balances exceeding the previously insured amount. The 10-basis point surcharge was
increased to 15 basis points on January&nbsp;1, 2010.

institutions pay for deposit insurance. Under the restoration plan, the assessment rates schedule
was raised by 7 basis points for all depository institutions beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2009 and the
assessment rates were raised again on April&nbsp;1, 2009 based on the risk rating of each financial
institution. Additionally, the FDIC imposed a 5 basis point special assessment as of June&nbsp;30, 2009
that was paid in September&nbsp;2009. As a consequence, BankAtlantic&#146;s FDIC insurance premium,
including the special assessment, increased from $2.8&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2008 to $11.0&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. In September&nbsp;2009, the FDIC

insurance assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012.
BankAtlantic&#146;s prepaid FDIC deposit assessment at December&nbsp;31, 2009 was $31.3&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FHLB has granted BankAtlantic a line of credit capped at 40% of assets subject to
available collateral, with a maximum term of ten years. BankAtlantic had utilized its FHLB line of
credit to borrow $282.0&nbsp;million and to obtain a $252.1&nbsp;million letter of credit securing public
deposits as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. The line of credit is secured by a blanket lien on BankAtlantic&#146;s
residential mortgage loans and certain commercial real estate and consumer home equity loans.
BankAtlantic&#146;s unused available borrowings under this line of credit were approximately $494.6
million at December&nbsp;31, 2009. An additional source of liquidity for BankAtlantic is its securities
portfolio. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic had $169&nbsp;million of unpledged securities that
could be sold or pledged for additional borrowings with the FHLB, the Federal Reserve or other
financial institutions. BankAtlantic is a participating institution in the Federal Reserve
Treasury Investment Program for up to $4.3&nbsp;million in funding and at December&nbsp;31, 2009,
BankAtlantic had $2.8&nbsp;million of short-term borrowings outstanding under this program. BankAtlantic
is also eligible to participate in the Federal Reserve&#146;s discount window program. The amount that
can be borrowed under this program is dependent on available collateral, and BankAtlantic had
unused available borrowings of approximately $96&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, with no amounts
outstanding under this program at December&nbsp;31, 2009. The above lines of credit are subject to
periodic review, may be reduced or terminated at any time by the issuer institution. If
BankAtlantic&#146;s earnings and credit quality continue to deteriorate and if the current economic
trends continue to adversely affect its performance, the above borrowings may be limited,
additional collateral may be required or these borrowings may not be available to us at all, in
which case BankAtlantic&#146;s liquidity would be materially adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic also has various relationships to acquire brokered deposits, and to execute
repurchase agreements, which may be utilized as an alternative source of liquidity. BankAtlantic
does not anticipate that its brokered deposit balances will increase significantly in the
foreseeable future. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic had $72.9&nbsp;million and $24.5&nbsp;million of
brokered deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase outstanding, representing 1.5%
and 0.5% of total assets, respectively. Additional repurchase agreement borrowings are subject to
available collateral. Additionally, BankAtlantic had total cash on hand or with other financial
institutions of $234.8&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s liquidity may be affected by unforeseen demands on cash. Our objective in
managing liquidity is to maintain sufficient resources of available liquid assets to address our
funding needs. Multiple market disruptions have made it more difficult for financial institutions
to borrow money. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty how long these adverse market
conditions may continue, nor can we anticipate the degree that such market conditions may impact
our operations. Deterioration in the performance of other financial institutions may adversely
impact the ability of all financial institutions to access liquidity. There is no assurance that
further deterioration in the financial markets will not result in additional market-wide liquidity
problems, and affect our liquidity position. BankAtlantic improved its liquidity position by
utilizing an increase in deposits, proceeds from the sales of securities available for sale, and
repayments of earning assets to repay borrowings, resulting in a $942.3&nbsp;million reduction in
borrowings as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s commitments to originate loans was $62.6&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009 and
$38.4&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, total loan commitments represented
approximately 1.69% of net loans receivable. BankAtlantic had no commitments to purchase loans at
December&nbsp;31, 2009 or December&nbsp;31, 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic had mortgage-backed securities of approximately $34.4
million pledged to secure securities sold under agreements to repurchase, $41.5&nbsp;million pledged to
secure public deposits, and $98.1&nbsp;million pledged to secure treasury tax and loan accounts and
potential borrowings at the Federal Reserve discount window.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant source of our liquidity is repayments and maturities of loans and securities.
The table below presents the contractual principal repayments and maturity dates of our loan
portfolio and securities available for sale at December&nbsp;31, 2009. The total amount of principal
repayments on loans and securities contractually due after December&nbsp;31, 2010 was $3.3&nbsp;billion, of
which $1.2&nbsp;billion have fixed interest rates and $2.1&nbsp;billion have floating or adjustable interest
rates. The table below represents the amounts due based on the contractual terms of the loans or
securities and actual principal repayments may differ from information shown below (in thousands):

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savings institutions are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#147;FDICIA&#148;). Regulations implementing the prompt corrective
action provisions of FDICIA define specific capital categories based on FDICIA&#146;s defined capital
ratios, as discussed more fully in Part&nbsp;I under &#147;Regulation of Federal Savings Banks&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OTS at its discretion can require an institution to maintain capital amounts and ratios
significantly above the &#147;well capitalized&#148; requirements based on the risk profile of the specific
institution. If higher capital requirements are imposed by the OTS, BankAtlantic could be required
to raise additional capital. There is no assurance that BankAtlantic would be successful in
raising additional capital in subsequent periods if required to do so.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic works closely with its regulators during the course of its exams and on an
ongoing basis. Communications with our regulators include providing information on an ad-hoc,
one-time or regular basis related to areas of regulatory oversight and bank operations. As part of
such communications, BankAtlantic has provided to its regulators forecasts, strategic business
plans and other information relating to anticipated asset balances, asset quality, capital levels,
expenses, anticipated earnings, levels of brokered deposits and liquidity, and has indicated that
BankAtlantic has no plans to pay dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company. The information
which BankAtlantic provides to its regulators is based on estimates and assumptions made by
management at the time provided, which are inherently uncertain and actual results may be
materially different than that estimated or projected.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by BankAtlantic to guarantee the
performance of a customer to a third party. BankAtlantic standby letters of credit are generally
issued to customers in the construction industry guaranteeing project performance. These types of
standby letters of credit had a maximum exposure of $10.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009.
BankAtlantic also issues standby letters of credit to commercial lending customers guaranteeing the
payment of goods and services. These types of standby letters of credit had a maximum exposure of
$3.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and
private borrowing arrangements and have maturities of one year or less. The credit risk involved
in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to
customers. BankAtlantic may hold certificates of deposit and residential and commercial real estate
liens as collateral for such commitments, similar to other types of borrowings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other commercial commitments are agreements to lend funds to a customer subject to conditions
established in the commitment. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future
cash requirements. BankAtlantic evaluates each customer&#146;s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
The amount of collateral required by BankAtlantic in connection with an extension of credit is
based on management&#146;s credit evaluation of the counter-party.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp did not have off balance sheet arrangements that
would have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

does not include estimated benefit payments after 2019. The actuarial present value of the
projected accumulated benefit obligation was $31.4&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009. The plan was

deficits over a seven year period which would include a contribution of $1.6&nbsp;million to the pension
plan for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s future cash contribution may
increase or decrease depending on the performance of the plan assets and the increase or decrease
of the projected benefit obligation in subsequent periods.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the agreement for the sale of Ryan Beck to Stifel, BankAtlantic Bancorp agreed to
indemnify Stifel and its affiliates against third party claims attributable to the conduct or
activities of Ryan Beck prior to the merger. This indemnification is subject to specified
thresholds and time periods and to a cap of $20&nbsp;million. The indemnification period for claims
asserted ended on August&nbsp;31, 2009. While discussions with Stifel with respect to this issue are
ongoing, based on the information provided by Stifel to date, management does not believe that it
is obligated to indemnify Stifel under the Ryan Beck sales agreement. BankAtlantic Bancorp also
agreed to indemnify Stifel against federal tax liabilities and claims relating to the ownership
interests in Ryan Beck subject to the $20&nbsp;million indemnification cap.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic has terminated various operating leases originally executed for store expansion
or back-office facilities. In certain lease terminations the landlord consents to the assignment
of the lease to a third party; however, BankAtlantic remains secondarily liable for the lease
obligation. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic was secondarily liable for $10.7&nbsp;million of
lease payments under leases that were assigned to third parties. BankAtlantic uses the same credit
policies in assigning these leases to third parties as it does in originating loans.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dividends</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp elected to exercise its right to defer payments of
interest on its trust preferred junior subordinated debt. During the deferral period,
BankAtlantic Bancorp is not permitted to pay dividends to its common shareholders. BankAtlantic
Bancorp can end the TruPs deferral period by paying all accrued and unpaid interest; however, it
currently expects to continue to defer interest for the foreseeable future. Further, the
availability of funds for dividend payments generally depends upon BankAtlantic&#146;s ability to pay
cash dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp. Current regulations applicable to the payment of cash
dividends by savings institutions impose limits on capital distributions based on an institution&#146;s
regulatory capital levels, retained net income and net income. BankAtlantic Bancorp does not
expect to receive cash dividends from BankAtlantic during 2010, or for the foreseeable future. See
Risk Factors &#151; &#147;Financial Services&#148; and Regulation and Supervision &#151; &#147;Limitation on Capital
Distributions.&#148;

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>BFC</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market valuations
that arise from interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and
equity price risk. BFC&#146;s primary market risk is equity price risk and interest rate risk.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because BankAtlantic Bancorp and Bluegreen are consolidated in the Company&#146;s financial
statements, a significant change in the market price of the stock of those companies would not
directly impact the Company&#146;s financial results, but would likely have an effect on the market
price of our common stock. The market price of BFC&#146;s common stock and the market prices of
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s and Bluegreen&#146;s common stock are important to the valuation and financing
capability of BFC. BFC also owns 800,000 shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock for which
no market is available. The ability to realize or liquidate this investment will depend on future
market and economic conditions and the ability to register the shares of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock
acquired by BFC in the event it converts its shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred stock, all
of which are subject to significant risk. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the closing price of Benihana&#146;s
Common Stock was $4.20 per share. The market value of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock if
converted to Benihana&#146;s Common Stock at December&nbsp;31, 2009 would have been approximately $6.6
million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company performed an impairment review of its
investment in Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock to determine if an impairment adjustment was
needed. Based on the evaluation and the review of various qualitative and quantitative factors,
including the decline in the underlying trading value of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock and the redemption
provisions of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company determined that there was an
other-than-temporary decline of approximately $3.6&nbsp;million and, accordingly, the investment was
written down to its fair value of approximately $16.4&nbsp;million. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company&#146;s
estimated fair value of its investments in Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock was approximately
$17.8&nbsp;million, which includes gross unrealized gains of approximately $1.3&nbsp;million (see Note 7 of
the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for further information).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Woodbridge</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge may be subject to interest rate risk on its and its subsidiaries long-term debt.
However, all of Woodbridge&#146;s and its subsidiaries&#146; borrowings with adjustable rates, which related
to Core and Carolina Oak, are in default as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, and principal and interest
payments have been suspended. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, Woodbridge and its subsidiaries had $170.7
million in borrowings with adjustable rates tied to the Prime Rate and/or LIBOR rates and $101.7
million in borrowings with fixed or initially-fixed rates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Bluegreen</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, Bluegreen&#146;s total revenues and net assets denominated in
a currency other than U.S. dollars represented an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues
and our consolidated assets. Sales generated by Bluegreen Properties, N.V., Bluegreen&#146;s subsidiary
in Aruba, are transacted in U.S. dollars. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates have not historically been significant to Bluegreen&#146;s operations or net assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, Bluegreen had fixed interest rate debt before purchase accounting adjustments of approximately $151.3&nbsp;million
and floating interest rate debt before purchase accounting adjustments of approximately $388.2&nbsp;million. In addition, the majority of
Bluegreen notes receivable were comprised of fixed rate loans. The floating interest rates are
based either upon the prevailing prime or LIBOR interest rates. For floating rate financial
instruments, interest rate changes do not generally affect the market value of debt but do impact
future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. Conversely, for fixed
rate financial instruments, interest rate changes affect the market value of the debt but do not
impact earnings or cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If interest rates increased or decreased one percentage point, the effect on interest expense
related to Bluegreen&#146;s variable-rate debt would be approximately $3.1&nbsp;million. A similar change in
interest rates would affect the total fair value of Bluegreen&#146;s fixed rate debt by an immaterial
amount. These analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic
activity that could result due to interest rate changes. Further, in
the event of a change in interest rates, Bluegreen would likely attempt to take actions to mitigate
any exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be
taken and their possible effects, the foregoing sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in
Bluegreen&#146;s financial structure.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of BankAtlantic&#146;s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, subjecting
BankAtlantic to significant interest rate risk because its assets and liabilities reprice at
different times, market interest rates change differently among each rate indices and certain
interest earning assets, primarily residential loans, may be prepaid before maturity as interest
rates change.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic has developed a model using standard industry software to measure its interest
rate risk. The model performs a sensitivity analysis that measures the effect on its net interest
income of changes in interest rates. The model measures the impact that parallel interest rate
shifts of 100 and 200 basis points would have on net interest income over a 12&nbsp;month period.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC Financial Corporation
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the accompanying consolidated
statements of financial condition and the related consolidated statements of operations, of
comprehensive income (loss), of change in equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of BFC Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;)
at December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31,
2009, based on criteria established in <I>Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company&#146;s management
is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing
under Item&nbsp;9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the
Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We did not
audit the financial statements of Bluegreen Corporation, an approximately 52&nbsp;percent-owned
consolidated subsidiary of the Company at December&nbsp;31, 2009, which statements were prepared on a
historical basis and reflect total assets of $1,131.3&nbsp;million (subsequently adjusted by the Company
to $894.2&nbsp;million for the application of purchase accounting, net of amortization of basis
difference) as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. Additionally, we did not audit the financial statements of
Bluegreen Corporation, an approximately 29&nbsp;percent-owned equity investment of the Company as of and
for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, which statements represent a net investment by the
Company totaling $115.1&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008 (prior to an other-than-temporary impairment
recorded by the Company, as discussed in Note 14, net of amortization of basis difference, of
$85.3&nbsp;million), and equity in the net gain (loss)&nbsp;of approximately ($154,000) (prior to the
amortization of basis difference of $13.9&nbsp;million) and $10.3&nbsp;million for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We audited the adjustments necessary to convert the
historical basis balance sheet of Bluegreen Corporation to the basis reflected in the Company&#146;s
2009 consolidated financial statements, as well as the other-than-temporary impairment recorded in
the Company&#146;s 2008 financial statements. The financial statements of Bluegreen Corporation were
audited by other auditors whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our opinion on the
financial statements expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Bluegreen
Corporation, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our
audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As discussed in Note 1, on November&nbsp;16, 2009, the Company purchased a controlling interest in
Bluegreen Corporation, and effective that date, consolidated the financial statements of Bluegreen
Corporation in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. As discussed in Note 1, the Company
changed the manner in which it accounts for business combinations and noncontrolling interests in
2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Management&#146;s assessment and our audit of BFC Financial Corporation&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting also included controls over the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with the instructions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Savings and Loan
Holding Companies (OTS Form&nbsp;H-(b) 11) to comply with the reporting requirements of Section&nbsp;112 of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA). A company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As described in Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has
excluded Bluegreen Corporation from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as
of December&nbsp;31, 2009 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination
during 2009. We have also excluded Bluegreen from our audit of internal control over financial
reporting. Bluegreen Corporation is an approximately 52&nbsp;percent-owned consolidated subsidiary, whose total assets
and total revenues represent $894.2&nbsp;million and $29.6&nbsp;million, respectively, of the related
consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC Financial Corporation (&#147;BFC&#148;, or, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise
requires, &#147;we&#148;, &#147;us&#148;, &#147;our&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a diversified holding company whose principal
holdings include a controlling interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries
(&#147;BankAtlantic Bancorp&#148;), a controlling interest in Bluegreen Corporation and its subsidiaries
(&#147;Bluegreen&#148;), a non-controlling interest in Benihana, Inc. (&#147;Benihana&#148;), and through its
wholly-owned Woodbridge Holdings subsidiary, a controlling interest in Core Communities, LLC
(&#147;Core&#148; or &#147;Core Communities&#148;). As a result of its position as the controlling shareholder of
BankAtlantic Bancorp, BFC is a &#147;unitary savings bank holding company&#148; regulated by the Office of
Thrift Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, BFC consummated its merger with Woodbridge Holdings Corporation
pursuant to which Woodbridge Holdings Corporation merged with and into Woodbridge Holdings, LLC
(&#147;Woodbridge&#148;), BFC&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary which continued as the surviving company of the
merger and the successor entity to Woodbridge Holdings Corporation. Pursuant to the terms of the
merger, which was approved by each company&#146;s shareholders at their respective meetings held on
September&nbsp;21, 2009, each outstanding share of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock automatically
converted into the right to receive 3.47 shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. Shares
otherwise issuable to BFC attributable to the shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class
B Common Stock owned by BFC were canceled in connection with the merger. As a result of the
merger, Woodbridge Holdings Corporation&#146;s separate corporate existence ceased and its Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock is no longer publicly traded. See Note 3 for additional information about the Merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC previously had an ownership interest of approximately 29% of Bluegreen&#146;s
outstanding common stock. On November&nbsp;16, 2009, BFC purchased approximately 7.4&nbsp;million additional
shares of the common stock of Bluegreen for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $23
million. As a result of such share purchase, BFC now owns approximately 16.9&nbsp;million shares, or
approximately 52%, of Bluegreen&#146;s outstanding stock. Accordingly, BFC has a controlling interest in
Bluegreen and, under GAAP, Bluegreen&#146;s results since November&nbsp;16, 2009, the date of the share
purchase, are and will be consolidated in BFC&#146;s financial statements. Any references to Bluegreen&#146;s
results of operations includes only 45&nbsp;days of activity for Bluegreen relating to the period from
November&nbsp;16, 2009, the date of the share purchase, through December&nbsp;31, 2009 (the &#147;Bluegreen
Interim Period&#148;). Prior to November&nbsp;16, 2009, the approximate 29% equity investment in Bluegreen
was accounted under the equity method. See Note 4 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements&#148; of this report for additional information about the Bluegreen share acquisition on
November&nbsp;16, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a holding company with controlling positions in BankAtlantic Bancorp and Bluegreen, GAAP
requires the consolidation of the financial results of both entities. As a consequence, the assets
and liabilities of both entities are presented on a consolidated basis in BFC&#146;s financial
statements. However, except as otherwise noted, the debts and obligations of the consolidated
entities, including Woodbridge, are not direct obligations of BFC and are non-recourse to BFC.
Similarly, the assets of those entities are not available to BFC absent a dividend or distribution
and, in the case of Bluegreen, a subsequent distribution by Woodbridge. The recognition by BFC of
income from controlled entities is determined based on the total percent of economic ownership in
those entities. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, BFC owned approximately 37% of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
and Class&nbsp;B common stock, representing approximately 66% of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s total voting
power. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, BFC owned approximately 52% of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accounting policies applied by the Company conform to accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Accounting Standards Board&#146;s (FASB)&nbsp;Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)
became effective on July&nbsp;1, 2009. At that date, the ASC became FASB&#146;s officially recognized source
of authoritative U.S. GAAP applicable to all public and non-public non-governmental entities,
superseding existing FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), Emerging
Issues Task Force (EITF)&nbsp;and related literature. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) under the authority of federal securities laws are also sources of
authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All other accounting literature is

Company&#146;s financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Use of Estimates &#151; </I></B>In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the statements of financial condition and
operations for the periods presented. Actual results could differ significantly from those
estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the
determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, the
allowance for loan losses, evaluation of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets for impairment,
valuation of securities, evaluation of securities for impairment and other-than-temporary declines
in value, the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosure or in satisfaction
of loans, revenue recognition on percent complete projects, determination of the valuation of real
estate assets and impairment, estimated costs to complete construction, the amount of the deferred
tax asset valuation allowance, accounting for uncertain tax positions, contingencies and
litigation, and accounting for share-based compensation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Consolidation Policy &#151; </I></B>The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of all the Company&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiaries, all of the accounts of BankAtlantic Bancorp and
Bluegreen because BFC has a controlling voting interest, as well as other entities in which the
Company and its subsidiaries hold controlling financial interest and variable interest entities
(&#147;VIEs&#148;) if the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary of the entity. All significant
inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated among consolidated entities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of operations of Bluegreen have been consolidated since November&nbsp;16, 2009, the
date of additional share acquisition described above. The Company consolidates all of Bluegreen&#146;s
wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities in which Bluegreen holds a controlling financial interest.
The Company also consolidates Bluegreen&#146;s non-wholly owned subsidiary, Bluegreen/Big Cedar
Vacations, LLC (the &#147;Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture&#148;), as Bluegreen holds a 51% equity interest
in the Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture, has an active role as the day-to-day manager of the
Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture&#146;s activities, and has majority voting control of the
Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture&#146;s management committee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008, Woodbridge, indirectly through a wholly-owned subsidiary, made a $3.0&nbsp;million
investment in Pizza Fusion. Pizza Fusion was determined to be a VIE under the provisions of the
accounting guidance for consolidation of variable interest entities and Woodbridge&#146;s wholly-owned
subsidiary was determined to be the primary beneficiary. Therefore, the Company consolidated Pizza
Fusion into its consolidated financial statements as of September&nbsp;18, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reclassifications &#151; </I></B>Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to
revised financial statement presentation for 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Woodbridge merger on September&nbsp;21, 2009 and the Bluegreen share acquisition
on November&nbsp;16, 2009, in each case as described above, the Company reorganized its reportable
segments to better align its segments with the current operations of its businesses. The Company&#146;s
business activities currently consist of (i)&nbsp;Real Estate and Other Activities and (ii)&nbsp;Financial
Services Activities. The Company currently reports the results of operations of its business
activities through six reportable segments: BFC Activities, Real Estate Operations, Bluegreen
Resorts, Bluegreen Communities, BankAtlantic and BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company. As a result
of this reorganization, our BFC Activities segment now includes activities formerly reported in the
Woodbridge Other Operations segment and our Real Estate Operations segment is comprised of what was
previously identified as the Land Division.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2009, Core reinitiated efforts to sell two of its commercial leasing projects (the
&#147;Projects&#148;) and began soliciting bids from several potential buyers to purchase assets associated
with the Projects. The assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition and Core
determined that it is probable that it will sell the Projects in 2010. Due to this decision, the
assets associated with the Projects that are for sale have been classified as discontinued
operations for all periods presented in accordance with the accounting guidance for the disposal of
long-lived assets. See Note 5 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for further
information.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">majority owners. Under these rules, legal reorganization or bankruptcy represents conditions
which can preclude consolidation or equity method accounting as control rests with the bankruptcy
court, rather than the majority owner. As described elsewhere in this report, Levitt and Sons
declared bankruptcy on November&nbsp;9, 2007. Therefore, in accordance with the accounting guidance for
consolidation, Levitt and Sons was deconsolidated as of November&nbsp;9, 2007, eliminating all future
operations of Levitt and Sons from the Company&#146;s financial results of operations, and the Company
followed the cost method of accounting to record its interest in Levitt and Sons. Under cost
method accounting, income may be recognized to the extent of cash received or when Levitt and Sons
is legally released from its bankruptcy obligations through the approval of the Bankruptcy Court.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;20, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming a plan of liquidation
jointly proposed by Levitt and Sons and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. That order
also approved the settlement pursuant to the settlement agreement that was entered into with the
Joint Committee of Unsecured Creditors. No appeal or rehearing of the Bankruptcy Court&#146;s order was
filed by any party, and the settlement was consummated on March&nbsp;3, 2009, at which time payment was
made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement. Under cost method
accounting, the cost of settlement and the related $52.9&nbsp;million liability (less $500,000 which was
determined as the settlement holdback and remained as an accrual pursuant to the settlement
agreement) was recognized into income in the first quarter of 2009, resulting in a $40.4&nbsp;million
gain on settlement of investment in subsidiary. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, we agreed to
share a percentage of any tax refund attributable to periods prior to the bankruptcy with the
Debtors Estate. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company accrued approximately $10.7&nbsp;million in
connection with the portion of the tax refund that we will be required to pay to the Debtors Estate
pursuant to the settlement agreement. As a result, the gain on settlement of investment in
Woodbridge&#146;s subsidiary for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 was $29.7&nbsp;million. See Note 25 for
more information regarding the tax refund.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Cash and Cash Equivalents </I></B>&#151; Cash equivalents consist of cash, demand deposits at financial
institutions (other than BankAtlantic), federal funds sold, securities purchased under resell
agreements, money market funds and other short-term investments with original maturities at the
date of purchase of 90&nbsp;days or less. Federal funds sold are generally sold for one-day periods,
and securities purchased under resell agreements are settled in less than 30&nbsp;days. Cash and cash
equivalents are held at various financial institutions located throughout the United States, Canada
and Aruba and exceed federally insured amounts. However, the Company has not experienced any losses
on such accounts and periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of financial institutions
maintaining the Company&#146;s deposits are performed to evaluate and mitigate, if necessary, credit
risk.

restricted funds are controlled by third-party escrow fiduciaries. Restricted cash as of December
31, 2008 included the amounts reserved under the Levitt and Sons Settlement Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Investment Securities at Cost or Amortized Costs &#151; </I></B>The Company designates its securities as
held to maturity, available for sale, or trading, depending on the Company&#146;s intent with regard to
its investments at the time of purchase. Debt securities that management has both the intent and
ability to hold to maturity are classified as securities held-to-maturity and are stated at cost,
net of unamortized premiums and unaccreted discounts. Certificate of deposits investments with
original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are
included in Investment Securities in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debt securities not held to maturity and marketable equity securities not accounted for under
the equity method of accounting are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair
value. Unrealized gains and losses, after applicable taxes, resulting from changes in fair value

the loan becoming past due 90&nbsp;days as to either principal or interest or (ii)&nbsp;when the borrower has
entered bankruptcy proceedings and the loan is delinquent. Exceptions to placing 90-day past due
loans on non-accrual may be made if there exists well secured collateral and the loan is in the
process of collection. Loans are placed on non-accrual or charged-off at an earlier date if
collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. A loan may be placed on non-accrual
status due to material deterioration of conditions surrounding the repayment sources, which could
include insufficient borrower capacity to service the debt, significantly delayed property sales or
development schedules, declines in the loan-to-value of the loan&#146;s collateral or other factors
causing the full payment of the loan&#146;s principal and interest to be in doubt. Accordingly, a loan
may be placed on non-accrual status even when payments of principal or interest are not currently
in default. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, interest accrued but not received is
reversed against interest income. A non-accrual loan may be restored to accrual status when there
has been a satisfactory period of performance and the loan is expected to perform in the future
according to its contractual terms. Interest income on performing impaired loans is recognized on
an accrual basis and the cost-recovery method is used for cash receipts on non-accrual loans

probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolios. The allowance is the amount considered
adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on management&#146;s evaluation of credit
risk as of period end. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the
loan is not collectible. Recoveries are credited to the allowance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance consists of two components. The first component of the allowance is for
&#147;non-homogenous&#148; loans that are individually evaluated for impairment. The process for identifying
loans to be evaluated individually for impairment is based on management&#146;s identification of
classified loans. Once an individual loan is found to be impaired, an evaluation is performed to
determine if a specific reserve needs to be assigned to the loan based on the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#146;s effective interest rate, except that as a
practical expedient, impairment may be measured based on the observable market price of the loan or
the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second component of the allowance is for &#147;homogenous&#148; loans in which groups of loans with
common characteristics are evaluated to estimate the inherent losses in the portfolio. Management
segregates homogenous loans into groups with certain common characteristics so as to form a basis
for estimating losses as it relates to the group. The allowance for homogenous loans has a
quantitative amount and a qualitative amount. The methodology for the quantitative component is
based on charge-off history by loan type adjusted by an expected recovery rate. A reasonable time
frame is selected for charge-off history in order to estimate the inherent loss in the portfolio.
The methodology for the qualitative component is determined by considering the following factors:
(1)&nbsp;delinquency and charge-off levels and trends; (2)&nbsp;problem loans and non-accrual levels and
trends; (3)&nbsp;lending policy and underwriting procedures; (4)&nbsp;lending management and staff; (5)
nature and volume of portfolio; (6)&nbsp;economic and business conditions; (7)&nbsp;concentration of credit;
(8)&nbsp;quality of loan review system; and (9)&nbsp;external factors. Based on an analysis of the above
factors, a qualitative amount is assigned to each loan product. BankAtlantic may also assign
specific reserves on residential real estate and real estate secured consumer loans that were
written down in prior periods to reflect further estimated market value declines in the collateral.

accordance with timeshare accounting rules. Under these rules, the estimate of uncollectibles is
based on historical uncollectibles for similar VOI notes receivable over the applicable historical
period. Bluegreen uses a static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each year&#146;s sales
over the entire life of those notes. Bluegreen also considers whether the historical economic
conditions are comparable to current economic conditions, as well as variations in underwriting
standards. Additionally, under timeshare accounting rules no consideration is given for future
recoveries of defaulted inventory in the estimate of uncollectible VOI notes receivable. Bluegreen
reviews its reserve for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis. Bluegreen estimates credit
losses on its notes receivable portfolios generated in connection with the sale of homesites in
accordance with the accounting rules for contingencies<I>, </I>as its notes receivable portfolios consist
of large groups of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans. Under these accounting rules, the amount of

pursuant to its vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities (more fully described in Note
11) or through term securitizations, Bluegreen evaluates whether or not such transfers should be
accounted for as a sale pursuant to the accounting rules under the accounting guidance for the
transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. The evaluation of
sale treatment under the accounting guidance mentioned above involves legal assessments of the
transactions, which include determining whether the transferred assets have been isolated from
Bluegreen (i.e., put presumptively beyond Bluegreen&#146;s reach and the reach of its creditors, even
in bankruptcy or other receivership), determining whether each transferee has the right to pledge
or exchange the assets it received, and ensuring that Bluegreen does not maintain effective control
over the transferred assets through either an agreement that either: (1)&nbsp;entitles and obligates
Bluegreen to repurchase or redeem the assets before their maturity; or (2)&nbsp;provides Bluegreen with
the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the assets (other than through a cleanup
call).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with such transactions, Bluegreen retains subordinated tranches and rights to
excess interest spread which are retained interests in the notes receivable sold. Bluegreen also
continues to service the notes for a fee. Historically Bluegreen has structured the majority of
such transactions to be accounted for as &#147;off-balance sheet&#148; sales. Gain or loss on the sale of
the receivables depends in part on the allocation of the previous carrying amount of the financial
assets involved in the transfer between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their
relative fair value at the date of transfer.

relieving VOI inventory and recording cost of sales. Under timeshare accounting rules relative
sales value method, cost of sales is calculated as a percentage of net sales using a cost-of-sales
percentage&#151;the ratio of total estimated development cost to total estimated VOI revenue, including
the estimated incremental revenue from the resale of VOI inventory repossessed, generally as a
result of the default of the related receivable. Also, pursuant to timeshare accounting rules,
Bluegreen does not relieve inventory for VOI cost of sales related to anticipated credit losses
(accordingly, no adjustment is made when inventory is reacquired upon default of the related
receivable). Bluegreen Communities focuses on developing and sub-dividing property and markets
residential home sites. For Bluegreen Communities real estate projects, costs are allocated to
individual home sites in the Bluegreen Communities projects based on the relative estimated sales
value of each home site in accordance with the accounting guidance for real estate, which defines
the accounting for costs of real estate projects. Under this method, the allocated cost of a unit
is relieved from inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon recognition of the related sale.
Home sites reacquired upon default of the related receivable are considered held for sale and are
recorded at fair value less costs to sell.

Capitalization of interest is discontinued if development ceases at a project. Capitalized interest
is expensed as a component of cost of sales as related homes, land and units are sold. For

and equipment and other amortizable intangible assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the
carrying amount of an asset to estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by
the asset, or by using appraisals of the related assets. Using estimated future undiscounted cash
flows or appraisals requires significant judgment and opinions in developing estimates. Real estate
may also be valued using third party offers to purchase, discounted cash flows or broker price
opinions. Appraisals generally use the market approach valuation technique and use market
observable data to formulate an opinion of the fair value of the properties. However, the appraiser
or brokers use professional judgment in determining the fair value of the properties, and the
Company may also adjust these values for changes in market conditions subsequent to the valuation
date when current appraisals are not available. As a consequence of using discounted cash flows,
broker price opinions, offers to purchase and adjustments to appraisals, the fair values of the
properties use Level 3 inputs in the determination of fair value.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assumptions developed and used by management to evaluate impairment are subjective and

the Company commits to a plan to abandon the asset before the end of its previously estimated
useful life. An impairment loss is recognized at the date a long-lived asset is exchanged for a
similar productive asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Long-lived

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s revenue and all related costs and expenses from house and land sales are
recognized at the time that closing has occurred, when title and possession of the property and the
risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the buyer, and when the Company does not have a
substantial continuing involvement in accordance with the accounting guidance for sales of real
estate. In order to properly match revenues with expenses, the Company estimates construction and
land development costs incurred and to be incurred, but not paid at the time of closing. Estimated
costs to complete are determined for each closed home and land sale based upon historical data with
respect to similar product types and geographical areas and allocated to closings along with actual
costs incurred based on a relative sales value approach. To the extent the estimated costs to
complete have significantly changed, the Company will adjust cost of sales in the current period
for the impact on cost of sales of previously sold homes and land to ensure a consistent margin of
sales is maintained.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue is recognized for certain land sales on the percentage-of-completion method when the
land sale takes place prior to all contracted work being completed. Pursuant to the requirements
of the accounting guidance for sales of real estate, if the seller has some continuing involvement
with the property and does not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership,
profit shall be recognized by a method determined by the nature and extent of the seller&#146;s
continuing involvement. In the case of land sales, this involvement typically consists of final
development activities. The Company recognizes revenue and related costs as work progresses using
the percentage of completion method, which relies on estimates of total expected costs to complete
required work. Revenue is recognized in proportion to the percentage of total costs incurred in
relation to estimated total costs at the time of sale. Actual revenues and costs to complete
construction in the future could differ from current estimates. If the estimates of development
costs remaining to be completed are significantly different from actual amounts, then the revenues,
related cumulative profits and costs of sales may be revised in the period that estimates change.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s other revenues consist primarily of rental property income, marketing revenues,
irrigation service fees, and title and mortgage revenue. Irrigation service connection fees are
deferred and recognized systematically over the life of the irrigation plant. Irrigation usage fees
are recognized when billed as the service is performed. Rental property income consists of rent
revenue from long-term leases of commercial property. The Company reviews all new leases in
accordance with the accounting guidance for leases. If the lease contains fixed escalations for
rent, free-rent periods or upfront incentives, rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the life of the lease.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the requirements of the accounting guidance for real estate
time-sharing activities, Bluegreen recognizes revenue on VOI and home site sales when a minimum of
10% of the sales price has been received in cash (demonstrating the buyer&#146;s commitment), the legal
rescission period has expired, collectability of the receivable representing the remainder of the
sales price is reasonably assured and Bluegreen has completed substantially all of its obligations
with respect to any development related to the real estate sold. Bluegreen believes that it uses a
reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectability of the receivables representing the
remainder of the sales price of real estate sold. See further discussion of Bluegreen&#146;s policies
regarding the estimation of credit losses on its notes receivable above. Should Bluegreen&#146;s
estimates regarding the collectability of its receivables change adversely, it may have to defer
the recognition of sales and its results of operations could be negatively impacted. Under the
provisions of timeshare accounting rules the calculation of the adequacy of
a buyer&#146;s commitment for the sale of VOIs requires that cash received towards the purchase of
Bluegreen&#146;s VOIs be reduced by the value of certain incentives provided to the buyer at the time of
sale. If after considering the value of the incentive the 10% requirement is not met, the VOI sale,
and the related cost and direct selling expenses, are deferred until such time that sufficient cash
is received from the customer, generally through receipt of mortgage

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where all development has not been completed, Bluegreen recognizes revenue in
accordance with the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Should Bluegreen&#146;s estimates of
the total anticipated cost of completing one of its Bluegreen Resorts&#146; or Bluegreen Communities&#146;
projects increase, it may be required to defer a greater amount of revenue or may be required to

financial condition consists of: (1)&nbsp;amounts receivable from customers on recent sales of VOIs
pending recording of the customers&#146; notes receivable in Bluegreen&#146;s loan servicing system; (2)
receivables related to unclosed home site sales; and, (3)&nbsp;receivables from third-party escrow
agents on recently closed home site sales.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under timeshare accounting rules, rental operations, including accommodations provided through
the use of Bluegreen&#146;s Sampler program, are accounted for as incidental operations whereby
incremental carrying costs in excess of incremental revenue are charged to expense as incurred.
Conversely, incremental revenue in excess of incremental carrying costs is recorded as a reduction
to VOI inventory. Incremental carrying costs include costs that have been incurred by Bluegreen
during the holding period of the unsold VOIs, such as developer subsidies and maintenance fees.
During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, all of Bluegreen&#146;s rental revenue and Sampler revenue
earned in the Bluegreen Resorts segment was recorded as an off-set to cost of other resort and
communities operations as such amounts were less than the incremental carrying cost.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for its acquisitions in accordance with the accounting guidance for
business combinations. If the Company makes a &#147;bargain purchase&#148;, the Company recognizes a gain in
the income statement on the acquisition date. A bargain purchase is a business combination in which
the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed,
as measured in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations exceeds the
aggregate of (i)&nbsp;the consideration transferred, as measured in accordance with the accounting
guidance, which generally require acquisition date fair value; (ii)&nbsp;the fair value of any
non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and (iii)&nbsp;in a business combination achieved in stages,
the acquisition date fair value of the Company&#146;s previously held equity interest in the acquiree.
This allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions, including estimates of
future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets. The Company may utilize independent third
parties to assist the Company in assessing market conditions when appropriate. The Company is also
required to periodically review these judgments and estimates and adjust them accordingly. If
conditions change from those expected, it is possible that the results could change in future
periods. Certain identifiable intangible assets, such as management contracts, are not amortized,
but instead are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis, or if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company
accounted for the acquisition of a controlling interest in Bluegreen in November&nbsp;2009, as a bargain
purchase and accordingly, the acquisition cost allocation of Bluegreen has had, and will continue
to have, a significant impact on the Company&#146;s operating results.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for income taxes is based on income before taxes reported for financial
statement purposes after adjustment for transactions that do not have tax consequences. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are realized according to the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates
as of the date of the statement of financial condition. The effect of a change in tax rates on
deferred tax assets and liabilities is reflected in the period that includes the statutory
enactment date. A deferred tax asset valuation allowance is recorded when it has been determined
that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. If a valuation
allowance is needed a subsequent change in circumstances in future periods that causes a change in
judgment about the realization of the related deferred tax amount could result in the reversal of
the deferred tax valuation allowance.

defined as a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that is not based on clear and
unambiguous tax law and which is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and
liabilities for interim or annual periods. The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an
uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained
on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The
Company measures the tax benefits recognized based on the largest benefit that has a greater than
50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Company recognizes interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income taxes.

amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest and
it also clarified that changes in a parent&#146;s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result
in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial

when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss is measured using the fair value of the

disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. This

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">2010 will require Bluegreen to consolidate its existing qualifying special purpose entities
associated with past securitization transactions. As such, it is expected that Bluegreen will
record a one-time non-cash after-tax adjustment to shareholders&#146; equity of approximately $35
million to $55&nbsp;million, representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, in
the first quarter of 2010. The cumulative effect will consist primarily of the reestablishment of
notes receivable (net of reserves) associated with those securitization transactions, the
elimination of residual interests that were initially recorded in connection with those
transactions, the impact of recording debt obligations associated with third party interests held
in the special purpose entities and related adjustments to deferred financing costs and inventory
balances. The Company anticipates that its adoption of these standards will have the following
impacts on its balance sheet: (1)&nbsp;assets will increase by approximately $380&nbsp;million to $400
million primarily related to the consolidation of notes receivable; (2)&nbsp;liabilities will increase

enhanced to add two new disclosures: (1)&nbsp;transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 measurements and the
reasons for the transfers, and (2)&nbsp;a gross presentation of activity within the Level 3 roll
forward. The amendment also includes clarifications to existing disclosure requirements on the
level of disaggregation and disclosures regarding inputs and valuation techniques. The amendment
would apply to all entities required to make disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair
value measurements. The amendment became effective for us for the quarter ending March&nbsp;31, 2009,
except for the gross presentation of the Level 3 roll forward information, which will become
effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2010 and for interim reporting

value measurements will not have a material effect on the Company&#146;s financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2009, the recession continued and the demand for residential and commercial inventory
showed no signs of recovery, particularly in the geographic regions where Core&#146;s properties are
located. The decrease in land sales in 2009 and continued cash flow deficits contributed to,
among other things, the deterioration of Core&#146;s liquidity. As a result, Core severely limited its
development expenditures in Tradition, Florida and discontinued development activity in Tradition
Hilton Head. The value of Core&#146;s assets decreased significantly and Core is currently in default under the terms
of all of its outstanding indebtedness totaling approximately $209.9&nbsp;million (including loans
secured by assets held for sale). In an effort to bring about an orderly liquidation without a
bankruptcy filing, Core commenced negotiations with all of its lenders and is pursuing all options
with its lenders, including offering deeds in lieu and other similar transactions wherein Core
would relinquish title to substantially all of its assets. As of February&nbsp;5, 2010, with Core&#146;s
concurrence, a significant portion of the land in Tradition Hilton Head had been placed under the
control of a court appointed receiver. There is no assurance, however, that Core will be
successful in its efforts. In consideration of the foregoing, the Company evaluated Core&#146;s real
estate inventory for impairment on a project-by-project basis. As a result of the impairment
analyses performed, the Company recorded impairment charges of $63.3&nbsp;million to reduce the carrying
amount of Core&#146;s inventory to its fair value at December&nbsp;31, 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Additional impairment charges may be required in the future if Core is not successful in its
efforts to liquidate its obligations in an orderly manner or otherwise resolve the outstanding
issues with its lenders.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2009, Core reinitiated efforts to sell the Projects and began soliciting bids from
several potential buyers to purchase assets associated with the Projects. The assets are available
for immediate sale in their present condition and Core determined that it is probable that it will
sell the Projects in 2010. Core has accepted an offer to sell the Projects, which has been approved
by the lender with substantially all of the proceeds going to satisfy its obligations to the
lender. However, there can be no assurance that the transaction will close and that the lender will
release Core from its obligations. See Note 5 of the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148;
for further information regarding the Projects.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core is also a party to a certain Development Agreement with the city of Hardeeville, SC,
under which Core is obligated to fund $1&nbsp;million towards the building of a fire station. Funding
is scheduled in three installments: the first installment of $100,000 was due October&nbsp;21, 2009; the
second installment of $450,000 was due on January&nbsp;1, 2010; the final installment is due on April&nbsp;1,
2010. Additionally, Core is obligated to fund certain staffing costing $200,000 under the terms of
this agreement. Core did not pay the initial $100,000 installment and has not funded the $200,000
payment for staffing, and on November&nbsp;5, 2009, Core received a notice of default from the city for
non payment. Core is in discussions with one of its lenders to fund the required payments out of
an interest reserve account established under its loan agreement with that lender while it seeks to
resolve this issue. However, in the event that Core is unable to obtain additional funds to make
these payments, it may be unable to cure the default on its obligation to the city which could
result in a loss of entitlements associated with the development project.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of current market conditions, and cessation of its activities, Core reduced its head
count by 41 employees during 2009, resulting in approximately $1.3&nbsp;million in severance charges
which were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negative impact of the adverse real estate market conditions on Core, together with Core&#146;s
limited liquidity, have caused substantial doubt regarding Core&#146;s ability to continue as a going
concern if Woodbridge chooses not to provide Core with the cash needed to meet its obligations when
and as they arise. Woodbridge has not committed to fund any of Core&#146;s obligations or cash
requirements, and there is no assurance that Woodbridge will provide any funds to Core. Core&#146;s
results are reported in the Real Estate Operations segment in Note 34. Core&#146;s financial information
included in the consolidated financial statements has been prepared assuming that Core will meet
its obligations and continue as a going concern. As a result, the consolidated financial statements
and the financial information provided for Core do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Carolina Oak</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development activities at Carolina Oak, which is within Tradition Hilton Head, were
suspended in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of, among other things, a deterioration in
consumer confidence, overall softening of demand for new homes, a decline in the overall economy,
increasing unemployment, a deterioration in the credit markets, and the direct and indirect impact
of the turmoil in the mortgage loan market. In 2009, the housing industry continued to face
significant challenges and Woodbridge made the decision to cease all activities at Carolina Oak.
Furthermore, the lender declared a default of the $37.2&nbsp;million loan that is collateralized by the
Carolina Oak property. Subsequently, the lender was taken over by the FDIC and accordingly, the
FDIC now holds the loan. While there may have been an issue with respect to compliance with
certain covenants in the loan agreements, we do not believe that an event of default had occurred
as was alleged by the lender. Woodbridge is currently negotiating with representatives of the FDIC
in an effort to bring about a satisfactory conclusion with regard to the debt. However, the outcome
of the negotiation is uncertain.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, Carolina Oak&#146;s project inventory of real estate was evaluated
for impairment in accordance with the accounting guidance for the impairment or disposal of
long-lived assets. As a result of the analysis, the Company recorded impairment charges of $16.7
million and $3.5&nbsp;million in cost of sales for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, which are reflected in the Real Estate Operations segment. See Note 12 of the &#147;Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for further information

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company and BankAtlantic actively manage liquidity and cash
flow needs. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company had cash of $14.0&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009,
does not have debt maturing until March&nbsp;2032 and has the ability to defer interest payments on its
junior subordinated debentures until December&nbsp;2013. BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent
Company&#146;s operating expenses for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $7.6
million, $5.6&nbsp;million and $4.2&nbsp;million, respectively and its non-interest income was $1.5&nbsp;million,
$1.2&nbsp;million and $8.2&nbsp;million, respectively. BankAtlantic&#146;s liquidity is dependent, in part, on
its ability to maintain or increase deposit levels and the availability of borrowings under its
lines of credit and Treasury and Federal Reserve lending programs. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009,
BankAtlantic had $235&nbsp;million of cash and available unused borrowings of approximately $760
million, consisting of $495&nbsp;million of unused FHLB line of credit capacity, $169&nbsp;million of
unpledged securities, and $96&nbsp;million of available borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve.
However, such available borrowings are subject to periodic reviews and may be terminated, suspended
or reduced at any time. Additionally, interest rate changes, additional collateral requirements,
disruptions in the capital markets or deterioration in BankAtlantic&#146;s financial condition may
reduce the amounts it is able to borrow or make terms of the borrowings and deposits less
favorable. As a result, there is a risk that the cost of funds will increase or that the
availability of funding sources may decrease.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial uncertainties throughout the Florida and national economies and U.S. banking
industry coupled with current market conditions have adversely affected BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s and
BankAtlantic&#146;s 2009 results. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic&#146;s capital was in excess of all
regulatory &#147;well capitalized&#148; levels. However, the OTS, at its discretion, can at any time
require an institution to maintain capital amounts and ratios above the established &#147;well
capitalized&#148; requirements based on its view of the risk profile of the specific institution.
BankAtlantic&#146;s communications with the OTS include providing information on an ad-hoc, one-time or
regular basis related to areas of regulatory oversight and bank operations. As part of such
communications, BankAtlantic has provided to its regulators forecasts, strategic business plans and
other information relating to anticipated asset balances, asset quality, capital levels, expenses,
anticipated earnings, levels of brokered deposits and liquidity, and has indicated that
BankAtlantic has no plans to pay dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company. If higher
capital requirements are imposed by its regulators, BankAtlantic could be required to raise
additional capital. There is no assurance that additional capital will not be necessary, or that
BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent Company or BankAtlantic would be successful in raising additional
capital on favorable terms or at all. Although BankAtlantic Bancorp and BankAtlantic have
experienced operating losses in each of the years in the three-year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2009,
BankAtlantic remains a &#147;well capitalized&#148; financial institution and both BankAtlantic Bancorp
Parent Company and BankAtlantic anticipate maintaining sufficient liquidity to fund operations at
least through December&nbsp;31, 2010. However, if unanticipated market factors emerge and/or
BankAtlantic Bancorp is unable to execute its plans or if BankAtlantic requires capital and
BankAtlantic Bancorp is unable to raise capital, it could have a material adverse impact on
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s business, results of operations and financial condition.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, Woodbridge Holdings Corporation and BFC consummated their previously
announced merger, pursuant to which Woodbridge merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of
BFC. Upon the effectiveness of the merger, the subsidiary was re-named Woodbridge Holdings, LLC,
and Woodbridge Holdings, LLC continued as the surviving company of the merger and the successor
entity to Woodbridge Holdings Corporation. Pursuant to the terms of the merger, which was approved
by the shareholders of Woodbridge and BFC at their respective meetings held on September&nbsp;21, 2009,
each outstanding share of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock automatically converted into the right
to receive 3.47 shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. Shares otherwise issuable to BFC
attributable to the shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock owned by
BFC were canceled in connection with the merger. The merger resulted in a net increase to BFC&#146;s
shareholders&#146; equity of approximately $95&nbsp;million, comprised of an increase in common stock and
additional paid-in capital of approximately $303,000 and $94.7&nbsp;million, respectively, and a
corresponding decrease to noncontrolling interest of approximately $99.6&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the consummation of the merger, BFC owned approximately 22% of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock and all of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, representing approximately 59% of the
total voting power of Woodbridge. Since BFC had a controlling interest in Woodbridge, the financial
results of Woodbridge prior to the merger were consolidated in BFC&#146;s financial statements and
continue to be consolidated in BFC&#146;s financial statements. The merger was accounted for as an
equity transaction for financial reporting and accounting purposes in accordance with recently
adopted FASB authoritative guidance in connection with
noncontrolling interests, which provides that changes in a parent&#146;s ownership interest which do not
result in the parent losing its controlling interest are reported as equity transactions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Florida law, holders of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock who did not vote to approve
the merger and properly asserted and exercised their appraisal rights with respect to their shares
(&#147;Dissenting Holders&#148;) are entitled to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the fair value
of their shares (as determined in accordance with the provisions of Florida law) in lieu of the
shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock which they would otherwise have been entitled to receive.
Dissenting Holders, who owned in the aggregate approximately 4.6&nbsp;million shares of Woodbridge&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, provided written notice to Woodbridge regarding their intent to exercise
their appraisal rights. In accordance with Florida law, Woodbridge provided written notices to the
Dissenting Holders setting forth, among other things, its determination that the fair value of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock immediately prior to the effectiveness of the merger was $1.10
per share. As of the date of this filing, one Dissenting Holder which held approximately 400,000
shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock had withdrawn its shares from the appraisal rights
process, while the remaining Dissenting Holders, who collectively held approximately 4.2&nbsp;million
shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, have rejected Woodbridge&#146;s offer of $1.10 per share
and requested payment for their shares based on their respective fair value estimates of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. Woodbridge is currently a party to legal proceedings relating
to the Dissenting Holders appraisal process. In December&nbsp;2009, a $4.6&nbsp;million liability was
recorded with a corresponding reduction to additional paid-in capital which is reflected in the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements representing in the aggregate Woodbridge&#146;s offer to the
Dissenting Holders. There is no assurance as to the amount of the cash payment that will be
required to be made to the Dissenting Holders, and such amount may exceed the $4.6&nbsp;million that we
have accrued related to this matter.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;16, 2009, the Company purchased approximately 7.4&nbsp;million shares of the common
stock of Bluegreen for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $23&nbsp;million, increasing its
interest from 29% to 52%, and resulting in the Company owning a controlling interest in Bluegreen. As a
result of the purchase of the Bluegreen shares, the Company now owns approximately 16.9&nbsp;million
shares. The Company previously accounted for its 29% equity interest in Bluegreen as an equity
method investment. The fair value of the Company&#146;s investment in Bluegreen immediately before the
acquisition was $25.1&nbsp;million after recognizing a loss resulting from the remeasurement of its investment in
Bluegreen of $8.1&nbsp;million, which is included in the gain on bargain
purchase of Bluegreen in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. Bluegreen&#146;s results

financial interest. The Company also consolidates Bluegreen&#146;s non-wholly owned subsidiary,
Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations, LLC (the &#147;Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture&#148;), as Bluegreen holds a
51% equity interest in the Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture, has an active role as the day-to-day
manager of the Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture&#146;s activities, and has majority voting control of
the Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture&#146;s management committee. The Company&#146;s purchase of additional
shares of Bluegreen common stock is part of BFC&#146;s strategy to maximize shareholder value by
providing strategic support to companies in which it holds investments. While BFC has held a
substantial equity position in Bluegreen for a number of years, BFC was given the opportunity to
expand its ownership by purchasing shares of Bluegreen held by a competitor who desired to dispose
of the shares. The purchase which increased BFC&#146;s ownership to a control level was made at what the
Company believes was an attractive price and resulted in a bargain gain under GAAP.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Company obtaining control over Bluegreen, the Company&#146;s previously held 29%
interest was re-measured to fair value. The fair value of the non-controlling interest was based
on a market approach valuation technique and inputs categorized as Level 1 inputs under the
accounting guidance for fair value measurements.
</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of the assets acquired includes: notes receivable which were fair valued using
an income approach and application of a discounted cash flow method; real estate inventory,
including resorts and communities inventory which was valued using a combination of the income
approach for the resorts inventory and independent appraisals for the communities real estate
projects; retained interest in notes receivable sold represents Bluegreen&#146;s economic interest in
the notes receivable it sold in a structured financing and was fair valued using an income approach
and a discount of the expected cash flows available to be distributed to investors; and intangible
assets represented by management contracts which consist of Bluegreen&#146;s contracts with various
homeowners associations to manage, service, staff and maintain the properties. The management
contracts were fair valued using an income approach and excess earnings method whereby the revenues
and costs attributable to the management contracts less charges for use of the contributory assets
are used to determined excess earnings. Such management contracts have indefinite useful lives and
are not amortized, but instead are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis, or if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be
recoverable.
</DIV>




<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management is evaluating the fair value of the inventory and certain contracts, and as such, amounts presented are
estimates and are subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional
information becomes available. Any change resulting from the final evaluation of the inventory of
Bluegreen as of the acquisition date may change the amount of the bargain purchase gain recorded at
December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of the liabilities includes: receivable-backed notes payable, notes payable and
lines of credit, which were valued based on the underlying terms, including maturity dates; junior
subordinated debentures which were valued based on a discounted cash flow analysis; and
non-controlling interest in a joint venture with Big Cedar LLC, which was valued using a
methodology consistent with the methodology used for the valuation of Bluegreen&#146;s underlying assets
and liabilities.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third quarter of 2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp distributed to its shareholders 4.441
subscription rights for each share of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock held on August&nbsp;24, 2009 (the &#147;BBX Rights Offering&#148;). Each whole subscription right
entitled the holder to purchase one share of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock at a
purchase price of $2.00 per share. The BBX Rights Offering commenced on August&nbsp;28, 2009 and was
completed on September&nbsp;29, 2009. BFC exercised its subscription rights in the BBX Rights Offering
to purchase an aggregate of 14.9&nbsp;million shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock for
an aggregate purchase price of $29.9&nbsp;million. This purchase increased BFC&#146;s ownership interest in
BankAtlantic Bancorp by approximately 7.3% to 37.2% and increased BFC&#146;s voting interest in
BankAtlantic Bancorp by approximately 6.7% to 66.0%. BFC&#146;s purchase of the 14.9&nbsp;million shares of
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock was accounted for as an equity transaction in
accordance with recently adopted FASB guidance effective January&nbsp;1, 2009, which provides that
changes in a parent&#146;s ownership interest which do not result in the parent losing its controlling
financial interest in its subsidiary are reported as equity transactions. Accordingly, BFC&#146;s
increase in BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s ownership interest resulted in an increase to additional paid-in
capital of approximately $7.0&nbsp;million, which represents the excess carrying value of the
noncontrolling interest acquired over the consideration paid.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From August&nbsp;18, 2008 through August&nbsp;28, 2008, BFC purchased an aggregate of 400,000 shares of
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock on the open market for an aggregate purchase price of
$2.8&nbsp;million. BFC&#146;s acquisition of the 400,000 <B>s</B>hares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common
stock increased BFC&#146;s ownership interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp by approximately 3.6%. The excess
of the fair value over the purchase price (negative goodwill) of $16.7&nbsp;million was allocated as a
pro rata reduction of the amounts that would otherwise have been assigned ratably to all of the
non-current and non-financial acquired assets, except assets to be disposed of by sale and deferred
tax assets, until the basis of such acquired assets was zero. The remaining unallocated negative
goodwill of approximately $9.1&nbsp;million was recognized as an extraordinary gain for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From December&nbsp;2, 2008 through December&nbsp;11, 2008, BFC purchased an aggregate of 323,848

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective August&nbsp;29, 2007, Woodbridge distributed to its shareholders 5.0414 subscription
rights for each share of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock and Class&nbsp;B common stock held on August
27, 2007 (the &#147;Woodbridge Rights Offering&#148;). Each whole subscription right entitled the holder to
purchase one share of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock at a subscription price of $2.00 per share.
BFC purchased an aggregate of 3,320,543 shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock in the
Woodbridge Rights Offering for an aggregate purchase price of $33.2&nbsp;million, which increased BFC&#146;s
economic ownership interest in Woodbridge by approximately 4.1%. The acquisition of the additional
interest in Woodbridge resulted in negative goodwill (excess of fair value of acquired net assets
over purchase price of shares) of approximately $11&nbsp;million. After ratably allocating this negative
goodwill to non-current and non-financial assets, the Company recognized an extraordinary gain, net
of tax, of $2.4&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.

soliciting bids from several potential buyers to purchase assets associated with the Projects. The
assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition and Core determined that it is
probable that it will sell the Projects in 2010. Due to this decision, the assets associated with
the Projects that are for sale have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods
presented in accordance with the accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets were reclassified as assets held for sale and the liabilities related to these
assets were reclassified as liabilities related to assets held for sale in the audited consolidated
statements of financial condition. Additionally, the results of operations for the Projects were
reclassified to income from discontinued operations. Depreciation related to these assets held for
sale ceased in December&nbsp;2009. The Company has elected not to separate these assets in the audited
consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented. Management has reviewed the net
asset value and estimated the fair market value of the assets based on the bids received related to
these assets and determined that an impairment charge was necessary to write down the aggregate
carrying value of the Projects to its fair value less the estimated costs to sell and, accordingly,
recorded an impairment charge of approximately $13.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009.

31, 2009 primarily reflect interest rate changes. The cash flows of these securities are guaranteed
by government sponsored enterprises. These securities are of high credit quality, the unrealized
loss is not significant and management of BankAtlantic has the intent and ability to hold the
securities until the price recovers and expects that the securities would be settled at a price not
less than the carrying amount. The unrealized loss on equity securities is not significant.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management reviews its securities available for sale portfolio for other-than-temporary
declines in value quarterly. As a consequence of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s review during the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized a $1.6&nbsp;million and a $3.4&nbsp;million,
other-than-temporary decline in value related to an equity investment in an unrelated financial
institution.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><B><I>BFC &#150; Benihana Investment</I></B></U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company owns 800,000 shares of Benihana Series&nbsp;B Convertible Preferred Stock (&#147;Convertible
Preferred Stock&#148;). The Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into an aggregate of 1,578,943
shares of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock at a conversion price of $12.67, subject to adjustment from time
to time upon certain defined events. Based on the number of currently outstanding shares of
Benihana&#146;s capital stock, the Convertible Preferred Stock, if converted, would represent an
approximately 19% voting interest and an approximately 9% economic interest in Benihana.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Convertible Preferred Stock was acquired pursuant to an agreement with Benihana on June&nbsp;8,
2004 to purchase an aggregate of 800,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock for $25.00 per
share. The shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock have voting rights on an &#147;as if converted&#148;
basis together with Benihana&#146;s Common Stock on all matters put to a vote of the holders of
Benihana&#146;s Common Stock. The approval of a majority of the holders of the Convertible Preferred
Stock then outstanding, voting as a single class, are required for certain events outside the
ordinary course of business. Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive
cumulative quarterly dividends at an annual rate equal to $1.25 per share, payable on the last day
of each calendar quarter. The Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to mandatory redemption at the
original issue price of $20&nbsp;million plus accumulated dividends on July&nbsp;2, 2014 unless BFC elects to
extend the mandatory redemption date to a later date not to extend beyond July&nbsp;2, 2024. At December
31, 2009, the closing price of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock was $4.20 per share. The market value of
the Convertible Preferred Stock if converted at December&nbsp;31, 2009 would have been approximately
$6.6&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2008, the Company performed an impairment evaluation of its investment in the
Convertible Preferred Stock and determined that there was an other-than-temporary decline of
approximately $3.6&nbsp;million and, accordingly, the investment was written down to its fair value of
approximately $16.4&nbsp;million. Concurrent with management&#146;s evaluation of the impairment of this
investment at December&nbsp;31, 2008, it made the determination to reclassify this investment from
investment securities to investment securities available for sale. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the
Company&#146;s estimated fair value of its investment in Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock was
approximately $17.8&nbsp;million, which includes a gross unrealized gain of approximately $1.3&nbsp;million
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. BFC will continue to monitor this investment to determine
whether any further other-than-temporary impairment charges may be required in future periods. The
estimated fair value of the Company&#146;s investment in Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock was
assessed using the income approach with Level 3 inputs by discounting future cash flows at a market
discount rate combined with the fair value of the underlying shares of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock that
BFC would receive upon conversion of its shares of Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock. See Note
30 for additional information concerning the Benihana Convertible Preferred Stock.

at an average price of $12.08 per share for an aggregate sales price of approximately $18.9&nbsp;million
and realized a gain of approximately $1.2&nbsp;million as a result of the sale.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In prior periods, impairment analyses were performed in connection with the Office Depot
investment, which included an evaluation of, among other things, qualitative and quantitative
factors relating to the performance of Office Depot and its stock price. As a result of these
evaluations, Woodbridge determined that other-than-temporary impairment charges were required at
December&nbsp;31, 2008 and March&nbsp;31, 2009 and accordingly, recorded impairment charges of $12.0&nbsp;million
and $2.4&nbsp;million, respectively, relating to the investment in Office Depot.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During November&nbsp;2009, the remaining 1,435,000 shares of Office Depot common stock held were
sold at an average price of $5.95 per share, or total proceeds of approximately $8.5&nbsp;million. As a
result of the sale, a gain was realized of approximately $6.7&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of
2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loans held for sale at December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 are loans that were originated through the
assistance of an independent mortgage company. The mortgage company provides processing and closing
assistance to BankAtlantic. Pursuant to an agreement, this mortgage company purchases the loans
from BankAtlantic within a defined period of time after the date of funding. BankAtlantic earns
the interest income during the period of ownership. The sales price is negotiated quarterly for all
loans sold during the quarter based on the originated loan balance. Gains from the sale of loans
held for sale were $0.5&nbsp;million, $0.3&nbsp;million and $0.5&nbsp;million, respectively, for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impaired loans without specific valuation allowances represent loans that were charged-down to
the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, loans in which the collateral value less cost
to sell was greater than the carrying value of the loan, loans in which the present value of the
cash flows discounted at the loan&#146;s effective interest rate was equal to or greater than the
carrying value of the loan, or large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans that are
collectively measured for impairment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp continuously monitors collateral dependent loans and performs an
impairment analysis on these loans quarterly. Generally, a full appraisal is obtained when a real
estate loan becomes adversely classified and an updated full appraisal is obtained within one year
from the prior appraisal date, or earlier if management deems it appropriate based on significant
changes in market conditions. In instances where a property is in the process of foreclosure, an
updated appraisal may be postponed beyond one year, as an appraisal is required on the date of
foreclosure; however, such loans are subject to quarterly impairment analyses. Included in total
impaired loans as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 was $258.4&nbsp;million of collateral dependent loans, of which
$221.9&nbsp;million were measured for impairment using current appraisals and $36.5&nbsp;million were
measured by adjusting appraisals to reflect changes in market conditions subsequent to the
appraisal date. Appraised values were adjusted down by an aggregate amount of $12.1&nbsp;million to
reflect current market conditions on 13 loans due to property value declines since the last
appraisal dates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, impaired loans with specific valuation allowances had been previously
charged down by $38.6&nbsp;million and impaired loans without specific valuation allowances had been
previously charged down by $34.1&nbsp;million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, impaired loans with specific
valuation allowances had been previously charged down by $21.9&nbsp;million and impaired loans without
specific valuation allowances had been previously charged down by $29.5&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average gross recorded investment in impaired loans was $416.5&nbsp;million, $192.8&nbsp;million and
$76.7&nbsp;million during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. BankAtlantic
generally measures non-homogenous loans for impairment using the fair value of collateral less cost
to sell method.

of doubts regarding the borrower&#146;s ability to repay principal or interest. Non-accrual tax
certificates are tax deeds or certificates in which interest recognition has been suspended due to
the aging of the certificate or deed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performing impaired loans represent loans where BankAtlantic Bancorp anticipates collecting
all of the principal and interest on the loans; but where the timing of the payments may not be in
accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans 90&nbsp;days past due and still
accruing are primarily loans that matured and are in the process of renewal, where the borrower
continues to make payments under the matured loan agreement or the loan has sufficient collateral
to prevent a loss to BankAtlantic Bancorp. Troubled debt restructured loans are loans in which the
original terms were modified granting the borrower loan concessions due to financial difficulties.
BankAtlantic Bancorp had commitments to lend $4.0&nbsp;million of additional funds on non-performing and
potential problem loans as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the cash paid for the purchase of defaulted receivables, Bluegreen also acquires delinquent or defaulted receivables from its qualifying special
purpose finance subsidiaries in exchange for unencumbered receivables (a process known as
substitution). During the Bluegreen Interim Period, Bluegreen acquired notes receivable totaling
$4.6&nbsp;million through substitutions. Although Bluegreen is not obligated to repurchase or substitute
for delinquent or defaulted notes receivable from its qualifying special purpose finance
subsidiaries, it may do so from time to time. The VOIs securing the delinquent and defaulted
receivables that Bluegreen received in this manner are typically recovered and put back in VOI
inventory and resold in the normal course of business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventory consisted of the combined real estate assets of Core Communities, Carolina Oak, and
BankAtlantic&#146;s residential construction development acquired in 2002 and BankAtlantic land
facilities held for sale. In addition, inventory at December&nbsp;31, 2009 included the real estate
assets of Bluegreen Resorts and Bluegreen Communities. Amounts included for Bluegreen Resorts
inventory as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 consisted of $55.8&nbsp;million of real estate for future development
and construction-in-progress and $166.2&nbsp;million of completed VOI units.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real estate inventory is reviewed for impairment on a project-by-project basis. Long-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used
is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future undiscounted
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or by using appraisals of the related assets. If
the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment
charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair
value. As a result of the impairment analyses performed throughout 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company
recorded impairment charges of inventory of real estate in the aggregate amount of approximately
$101.9&nbsp;million (including the effect of purchase accounting of $8.9&nbsp;million), $3.5&nbsp;million and
$226.9&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Impairment
charges of inventory of real estate are included in cost of sales in the Company&#146;s consolidated
statements of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impairment charges recorded in 2009 related to Core Communities and Carolina Oak and were
mainly the result of the continued downturn in the real estate markets which continued to
negatively affect real estate

from properties held for use to land and facilities held for sale. BankAtlantic evaluates these
properties based on updated indicators of value periodically and recognized $0.8&nbsp;million, $2.8

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><I>Investment in Bluegreen Corporation </I></U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously discussed, on November&nbsp;16, 2009, the Company purchased approximately 7.4&nbsp;million
additional shares of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock, resulting in an increase in its ownership in
Bluegreen from 9.5&nbsp;million shares, or 29%, to 16.9&nbsp;million shares, or 52%. As a result of the
purchase, the Company has a controlling interest in Bluegreen and, accordingly, has consolidated
Bluegreen&#146;s results since November&nbsp;16, 2009 into the Company&#146;s financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to November&nbsp;16, 2009, the investment in Bluegreen was accounted for under the equity
method of accounting. The cost of the Bluegreen investment was adjusted to recognize the Company&#146;s
interest in Bluegreen&#146;s earnings or losses. The difference between a) the Company&#146;s ownership
percentage in Bluegreen multiplied by its earnings and b) the amount of the Company&#146;s equity in
earnings of Bluegreen as reflected in the Company&#146;s financial statements related to the
amortization or accretion of purchase accounting made at the time of the initial acquisition of
Bluegreen&#146;s common stock and a basis difference due to impairment charges recorded on the
investment in Bluegreen, as described below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, the Company began evaluating its investment in Bluegreen on a quarterly basis for
other-than-temporary impairments in accordance with accounting guidance for investments. These
evaluations generally included an analysis of various quantitative and qualitative factors relating
to the performance of Bluegreen and its stock price. Bluegreen&#146;s investment was valued using a
market approach valuation technique and Level 1 valuation inputs under accounting guidance for fair
value measurements. Based on the results of the evaluations of the investment in Bluegreen,
other-than-temporary impairment charges of approximately $31.2&nbsp;million and $94.4&nbsp;million were
recorded during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007, no other-than-temporary charges related to the investment in Bluegreen were
recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the impairment charges taken, a basis difference was created between the
investment in Bluegreen and the underlying assets and liabilities carried on the books of
Bluegreen. Therefore, earnings from Bluegreen were adjusted each period to reflect the
amortization of this basis difference. As such, a methodology was established to allocate the
impairment loss to the relative estimates of the fair value of Bluegreen&#146;s underlying assets based
upon the position that the impairment loss was a reflection of the perceived value of these
underlying assets. The appropriate amortization was calculated based on the useful lives of the
underlying assets and other relevant data associated with each asset category. Amortization for the
interim period from January&nbsp;1, 2009 to November&nbsp;16, 2009 and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008
of approximately $29.0&nbsp;million and $13.9&nbsp;million, respectively, was recorded in the Company&#146;s pro
rata share of Bluegreen&#146;s net income.

value of its investment in its unconsolidated trusts, which consists of its common interests in
subordinated trust debt securities of approximately $406,000, was less than the carrying value of
this investment of $2.6&nbsp;million primarily due to the deterioration of the market for these
instruments and overall economic conditions. Accordingly, it was determined that an impairment
charge of approximately $2.2&nbsp;million was required at December&nbsp;31, 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill is tested for potential impairment annually or during interim periods if impairment
indicators exist.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value
of the reporting units. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and
estimates relating to future cash flows, including the Company&#146;s view of current economic
indicators and market valuations, and assumptions about the Company&#146;s strategic plans with regard
to its operations. Due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates, actual results could
differ materially from the estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing its impairment analysis, BankAtlantic Bancorp used a combination of the
discounted cash flow methodology and a market multiple methodology to determine the fair value of
each reporting unit. The aggregate fair value of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s reporting units was
compared to its market capitalization adjusted for a control premium in order to determine the
reasonableness of the financial model output. A control premium represents the value an investor
would pay above minority interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in
the respective company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of
the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit. The discount rate applied
to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks
of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows. A
five year period is generally used in computing discounted cash flow values. The most significant
assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate, the terminal value
and the forecast of future cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market multiple methodology establishes fair value by comparing BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
reporting units to other similar publicly traded companies. The market multiples that BankAtlantic
Bancorp used in the determination of the fair value of the reporting units were its market
capitalization to its tangible stockholders&#146; equity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to deteriorating economic and real estate market conditions and the effects that
the external environment had on BankAtlantic&#146;s business units, BankAtlantic, in the first quarter
of 2009, continued to reduce its asset balances and borrowings with a view toward improving its
regulatory capital ratios and revised its projected operating results to reflect a smaller
organization in subsequent periods. Additionally, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s market capitalization
continued to decline as the average closing price of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock
on the New York Stock Exchange for the month of March&nbsp;2009 was $1.57 compared to $4.23 for the
month of December&nbsp;2008, a decline of 63%. Management of BankAtlantic Bancorp believed that the
foregoing factors indicated that the fair value of its reporting units might have declined below
their carrying amount, and, accordingly, an interim goodwill impairment test was performed as of
March&nbsp;31, 2009. Based on the results of this interim goodwill impairment evaluation, an impairment
charge of $8.5&nbsp;million, net of a purchase accounting adjustment from step acquisition of
approximately $0.6&nbsp;million, was recorded during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009, relating to
BankAtlantic&#146;s tax certificate ($4.7&nbsp;million) and investments ($4.5&nbsp;million) reporting units.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s management performed an annual goodwill impairment test as of September
30, 2009 and determined that the goodwill of $13.1&nbsp;million associated with BankAtlantic&#146;s capital
services reporting unit was not impaired. If market conditions do not improve or deteriorate
further, goodwill impairment charges may be recognized in future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the results of the goodwill impairment evaluation during 2008, an impairment charge
relating to BankAtlantic Bancorp of $46.6&nbsp;million was recorded, net of BFC&#146;s purchase accounting
adjustment from step acquisition of approximately $1.7&nbsp;million. The entire amount of goodwill,
relating to BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s commercial lending and community banking reporting units of
$31.0&nbsp;million and $17.3&nbsp;million, respectively, was determined to be impaired. The goodwill
impairment recognized during 2008 generally reflected the adverse conditions in the financial
services industry, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s market capitalization declining significantly below its
tangible book value and the effect that the continued deterioration in the general economy as well
as the Florida real estate markets had on the credit quality of BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolio.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent transactions where BankAtlantic sells
a portion of its current investment portfolio (usually MBS&#146;s and REMIC&#146;s) at a negotiated rate and
agrees to repurchase the same assets on a specified future date. BankAtlantic issues repurchase
agreements to institutions and to its customers. These transactions are collateralized by
securities available for sale. Customer repurchase agreements are not insured by the FDIC. At
December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, the outstanding balances of customer repurchase agreements were $24.5
million and $41.4&nbsp;million, respectively. There were no institutional repurchase agreements
outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008. BankAtlantic had $169&nbsp;million of securities that could
be sold or pledged for additional repurchase agreement borrowings.

with Branch Banking and Trust Company (&#147;BB&#038;T&#148;) (the &#147;BB&#038;T Purchase Facility&#148;) provides for the sale
of Bluegreen&#146;s timeshare receivables at an advance rate of 67.5% of the principal balance up to a
cumulative purchase price of $150.0&nbsp;million on a revolving basis, subject to the terms of the
facility, eligible collateral and customary terms and conditions. The BB&#038;T Purchase Facility
revolving advance period under the facility will end on June&nbsp;29, 2010. Should a &#147;takeout financing&#148;
(as defined in the applicable facility agreements) occur prior to June&nbsp;29, 2010 then the facility
limit will either remain at the current facility limit of $150.0&nbsp;million or decrease to $100.0
million, under certain circumstances. While ownership of the receivables is transferred for legal
purposes, the transfers of receivables under the facility are accounted for as a financing
transaction for financial accounting purposes. Accordingly, the receivables will continue to be
reflected as assets and the associated obligations will be reflected as liabilities on the balance
sheet. The BB&#038;T Purchase Facility is nonrecourse and is not guaranteed by Bluegreen.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the outstanding balance of the BB&#038;T Purchase Facility reflected an
advance of 80.7% on the receivables transferred to BB&#038;T under the facility; however, Bluegreen will
equally share with BB&#038;T in the excess cash flows generated by the receivables sold (excess meaning
after customary payments of fees, interest and principal under the facility) until the advance rate
on the existing receivables decreases to 67.5% as the outstanding balance amortizes. The interest
rate on the BB&#038;T Purchase Facility is the prime rate plus 2.5%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Bluegreen Interim Period, Bluegreen pledged $9.5&nbsp;million of VOI notes receivable to
this facility and received cash proceeds of $2.0&nbsp;million. Bluegreen also made repayments of $4.9
million on the facility for the same period.

facility during a two-year period ending on August&nbsp;27, 2010, subject to customary terms and

collected on the pledged receivables, with the remaining balance, if any, due on August&nbsp;27, 2014.
The facility bears interest at a rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus 2.5%, subject to a floor of

under the facility and Liberty Bank is repaid through the expiration of the advance period,
pursuant to the terms of the facility.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Bluegreen Interim Period, Bluegreen pledged $7.6&nbsp;million of VOI notes receivable to
this facility and received cash proceeds of $729,000. In addition to these borrowings Bluegreen
also had repayments of $2.8&nbsp;million for the same period.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The GE Bluegreen/Big Cedar Receivables Facility. </I>The Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture has a
$45.0&nbsp;million revolving VOI receivables credit facility with GE (the &#147;GE Bluegreen/Big Cedar
Receivables Facility&#148;). Bluegreen Corporation has guaranteed the full payment and performance of
the Bluegreen/Big Cedar Joint Venture in connection with the GE Bluegreen/Big Cedar Receivables
Facility. The advance period under this facility expired on April&nbsp;16, 2009, and all outstanding
borrowings mature no later than April&nbsp;16, 2016. The facility has detailed requirements with
respect to the eligibility of receivables for inclusion and other conditions to funding. The
facility includes affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default. All
principal and interest payments received on pledged receivables are applied to principal and
interest due under the facility. Indebtedness under the facility bears interest adjusted monthly
at the 30&nbsp;day LIBOR rate plus 1.75%. For the Bluegreen Interim Period, Bluegreen repaid $1.7
million under this facility.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Wells Fargo Facility. </I>Bluegreen has a credit facility with Wells Fargo Foothill, LLC
(&#147;Wells Fargo&#148;). Historically, Bluegreen has primarily used this facility for borrowings
collateralized by the pledge of certain VOI receivables which typically have been its one-year term
receivables. The borrowing period for advances on eligible receivables expired on December&nbsp;31,
2009, and the maturity date of all borrowings is December&nbsp;31, 2010. The advance rate ranges from
85% to 90% of certain VOI receivables. Borrowings under this facility are subject to eligible
collateral and customary terms and conditions. The interest rate charged on outstanding receivable
borrowings under the facility, as amended, is the prime lending rate plus 0.25% when the average
monthly outstanding loan balance under certain sub-lines is greater than or equal to $15.0&nbsp;million.
If the average monthly outstanding loan balance under certain sub-lines is less than $15.0&nbsp;million,
the interest rate is the greater of 4.00% or the prime lending rate plus 0.50%. All principal and
interest payments received on pledged receivables are applied to principal and interest due under
the facility.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Bluegreen Interim Period, Bluegreen pledged $7.0&nbsp;million of notes receivable to this

Subsequently, the lender was taken over by the FDIC and, accordingly, the FDIC now holds the loan.

Woodbridge is negotiating with representatives of the FDIC in an effort to bring about a
satisfactory conclusion with regard to the debt. However, the outcome of the negotiation is
uncertain. See Note 2 for further discussion regarding this loan.

financial institution acquired by BankAtlantic agreed to accept a $2.8&nbsp;million payment for the
retirement of $3.1&nbsp;million in mortgage-backed bonds. Included in the Company&#146;s Consolidated
Statement of Operations in Financial Services &#151; cost associated with debt redemption is a $0.3
million gain from the early extinguishment of the mortgage-backed bond. BankAtlantic pledged $3.3
million of residential loans as collateral for the outstanding balance of the mortgage-backed bond
as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge formed four statutory business trusts which issued trust preferred
securities to third parties and trust common securities to Woodbridge and used the proceeds to
purchase an identical amount of junior subordinated debentures from Woodbridge. Interest on the
junior subordinated debentures and distributions on these trust preferred securities are payable
quarterly in arrears at the fixed rates as described in the above table until the optional
redemption date and thereafter at the floating rates specified in the above table until the
corresponding scheduled maturity date. The trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory
redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the junior subordinated debentures at maturity
or their earlier redemption. The junior subordinated debentures are redeemable, in whole or in
part, at Woodbridge&#146;s option at any time after five years from the issue date or sooner following
certain specified events.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Bluegreen Junior Subordinated Debentures</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen formed statutory business trusts and each issued trust preferred securities and
invested the proceeds thereof in its junior subordinated debentures. In each of these
transactions, the applicable Trust issued trust preferred securities as part of a larger pooled
trust securities offering which was not registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The
applicable Bluegreen trust then used the proceeds from issuing the trust preferred securities to
purchase an identical amount of junior subordinated debentures from Bluegreen. Interest on the
junior subordinated debentures and distributions on the trust preferred securities are payable
quarterly in arrears at the fixed rates as described in the above table until the optional
redemption date and thereafter at the floating rates specified in the above table until the
corresponding scheduled maturity date. Distributions on the trust preferred securities are
cumulative and based upon the liquidation value of the trust preferred security. The trust
preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of
the junior subordinated debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption. The junior subordinated
debentures are redeemable in whole or in part at Bluegreen&#146;s option at any time after five years
from the issue date or sooner following certain specified events. In addition, Bluegreen made an
initial equity contribution to each Trust in exchange for its common securities, all of which are
owned by Bluegreen, and those proceeds were also used to purchase an identical amount of junior
subordinated debentures from Bluegreen. The terms of each trust&#146;s common securities are nearly
identical to the trust preferred securities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>BankAtlantic Bancorp Junior Subordinated Debentures</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp has formed thirteen statutory business trusts (&#147;Trusts&#148;) for the purpose
of issuing Trust Preferred Securities (&#147;trust preferred securities&#148;) and investing the proceeds
thereof in junior subordinated debentures of BankAtlantic Bancorp. The trust preferred securities
are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by BankAtlantic Bancorp. The Trusts used the proceeds
from issuing trust preferred securities and the issuance of its common securities to BankAtlantic
Bancorp to purchase junior subordinated debentures from BankAtlantic Bancorp. Interest on the
junior subordinated debentures and distributions on the trust preferred securities are payable
quarterly in arrears. Distributions on the trust preferred securities are cumulative and are based
upon the liquidation value of the trust preferred security. BankAtlantic Bancorp has the right, at
any time, as long as there are no continuing events of default, to defer payments of interest on
the junior subordinated debentures for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarters; but not
beyond the stated maturity of the junior subordinated debentures. Beginning in February and March
2009 BankAtlantic Bancorp notified the trustees of the junior subordinated debentures that it has
elected to defer interest payments for the next regularly scheduled quarterly interest payment
dates and BankAtlantic Bancorp has continued to elect to defer interest payments for each
succeeding quarterly interest payment date. BankAtlantic Bancorp has the ability under the junior
subordinated debentures to continue to defer interest payments through ongoing, appropriate notices
to each of the trustees, and make a decision each quarter as to whether to continue the deferral of
interest. BankAtlantic Bancorp currently expects to continue to defer interest payments on the
junior subordinated debentures for the foreseeable future. During the deferral period, interest
will continue to accrue on the junior subordinated debentures at the stated coupon rate, including
on the deferred interest, and BankAtlantic Bancorp will continue to record the interest expense
associated with the junior subordinated debentures. During the deferral period, BankAtlantic
Bancorp may not, among other things and with limited exceptions, pay cash dividends on or
repurchase its common stock nor make any payment on outstanding debt obligations that rank equally
with or junior to the junior subordinated debentures. BankAtlantic Bancorp may

subordinated debentures was $14.1&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. The trust preferred securities
are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the junior subordinated
debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption. BankAtlantic Bancorp has the right to redeem

The redemption of the subordinated debentures is subject to BankAtlantic Bancorp having received

trust preferred securities having an aggregate principal amount of approximately $285&nbsp;million at a
purchase price of $200 per $1,000 liquidation amount, or an aggregate of $57&nbsp;million. During
February&nbsp;2010, the cash offer with respect to the approximate $55&nbsp;million of publicly traded trust
preferred securities expired without any such trust preferred securities being repurchased, while
the expiration date for the offers relating to the remaining $230&nbsp;million of trust preferred
securities was extended until April&nbsp;21, 2010. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s ability to complete the offers
to purchase $230&nbsp;million of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s trust preferred securities is subject to the
completion of a financing transaction sufficient to pay the purchase price and the receipt of
consents and tenders from Holders of the trusts preferred securities sufficient to approve the
proposed amendments to the applicable indenture governing the note underlying the relevant series
of trusts preferred securities. Accordingly, there is no assurance that BankAtlantic Bancorp will
repurchase any or a significant portion of the trust preferred securities.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the development of certain of Core&#146;s projects, community development,
special assessment or improvement districts have been established and may utilize tax-exempt bond
financing to fund construction or acquisition of certain on-site and off-site infrastructure
improvements near or at these communities. The obligation to pay principal and interest on the
bonds issued by the districts is assigned to each parcel within the district, and a priority
assessment lien may be placed on benefited parcels to provide security for the debt service. The
bonds, including interest and redemption premiums, if any, and the associated priority lien on the
property are typically payable, secured and satisfied by revenues, fees, or assessments levied on
the property benefited. Core is required to pay the revenues, fees, and assessments levied by the
districts on the properties it still owns that are benefited by the improvements. Core may also be
required to pay down a specified portion of the bonds at the time each unit or parcel is sold. The
costs of these obligations are capitalized to inventory during the development period and
recognized as cost of sales when the properties are sold.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core&#146;s bond financing at December&nbsp;31, 2009 and December&nbsp;31, 2008 consisted of district bonds
totaling $218.7&nbsp;million at each of these dates with outstanding amounts of approximately $170.8
million and $130.5&nbsp;million, respectively. Bond obligations
at December&nbsp;31, 2009 mature in 2035 and 2040. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, Core owned approximately
16% of the property subject to assessments within the community development district and
approximately 91% of the property subject to assessments within the special assessment district.
During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, Core recorded a liability of approximately
$693,000, $584,000 and $1.3&nbsp;million, respectively, in assessments on property owned by it in the
districts. Core is responsible for any assessed amounts until the underlying property is sold and
will continue to be responsible for the annual assessments through the maturity dates of the
respective bonds issued if the property is never sold. Based on Core&#146;s approximate 91% ownership of
property within the special assessment district as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, it will be responsible for
the payment of approximately $10&nbsp;million in assessments by March&nbsp;2011. If Core sells land within
the special assessment district and reduces its ownership percentage, the potential payment of
approximately $10&nbsp;million would decrease in relation to the decrease in the ownership percentage.
In addition, Core has guaranteed payments for assessments under the district bonds in Tradition,
Florida which would require funding if future

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC and its subsidiaries evaluate their deferred tax assets to determine if valuation
allowances are required. In the evaluation, management considers net operating loss carryback
availability, expectations of sufficient future taxable income, trends in earnings, existence of
taxable income in recent years, the future reversal of temporary differences, and available tax
planning strategies that could be implemented, if required. Valuation allowances should be
established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not
standard. Based on evaluations, deferred tax valuation allowances of $48.7&nbsp;million, $190.5&nbsp;million
and $77.6&nbsp;million were established for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be reversed when each of the companies and
their respective subsidiaries generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize the tax
benefits of the related deferred tax assets. The majority of the benefits of the net deferred tax
assets can be carried forward for 20&nbsp;years and applied to offset future taxable income. The
deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be reversed if and when it becomes more likely than not
that BFC and its subsidiaries will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize the
tax benefits of the related deferred tax assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2009, the Workers, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 was enacted.
The Act extended the net operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;) carry-back period from two years to up to five
years for the 2008 or the 2009 tax years. Included in the Company&#146;s statement of financial
condition is a current income tax receivable of $31.7&nbsp;million resulting from BankAtlantic&#146;s
election to carryback its 2009 NOL for five years and a current income tax receivable of $34.6
million resulting from Woodbridge&#146;s election to carryback its 2008 NOL for five years. Under the
terms of the Woodbridge Settlement Agreement entered into with the Joint Committee of Unsecured
Creditors in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases, the bankruptcy estate is entitled to be paid 50% of the tax
refund resulting from Woodbridge&#146;s election to carryback its 2008 NOLs for five years that is
attributed to Levitt and Sons. Accordingly, Woodbridge has established a liability of $10.7
million, which is the amount estimated to be due under this agreement, and the &#147;Gain on settlement
of investment in Woodbridge&#146;s subsidiary&#148; was reduced by such amount.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;1, 2007, the Company adopted the accounting guidance on uncertain income tax
positions (ASC 740). As a result of the adoption of ASC 740, the Company (without consideration of
BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge) had no significant adjustment upon the adoption of this
interpretation. The Company&#146;s interest in cumulative adjustments associated with the implementation
of ASC 740 by BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge increased the Company&#146;s retained earnings opening
balance and decreased liabilities in the aggregate amount of $121,000. These cumulative-effect
adjustments represent the difference between the amount of tax benefits required to be recognized
based on the application of ASC 740 and the amount of tax benefits recognized prior to the
application of ASC 740. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax
benefits was as follows (in thousands):

the Company&#146;s consolidated effective tax rates for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>BFC Financial Corporation<BR>
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries file consolidated U.S. federal and Florida income tax
returns. Subsidiaries, in which BFC owns less than 80% of the outstanding common stock are not
included in BFC&#146;s consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. BFC and its subsidiaries file
separate state income tax returns for each jurisdiction, other than Florida. Accordingly, upon
consummation of the merger on September&nbsp;21, 2009,
Woodbridge became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC and its activities are included in the
Company&#146;s consolidated tax return from the date of the merger. Prior to the merger, Woodbridge was
not included in the Company&#146;s consolidated tax return. As BFC owns less than 80% of BankAtlantic
Bancorp, Bluegreen and Pizza Fusion, those companies accordingly are not included in BFC&#146;s
consolidated tax return. BFC&#146;s deferred tax assets and liabilities, including net operating loss
(&#147;NOLs&#148;) carryforwards are specific to BFC and may not be utilized by BankAtlantic Bancorp,
Bluegreen or Pizza Fusion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009, BFC (excluding BankAtlantic Bancorp, pre-merger Woodbridge, Bluegreen
and Pizza Fusion) had estimated state and federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$85.4&nbsp;million which expire from 2011 through 2029. A valuation allowance was established at
December&nbsp;31, 2009 for these NOLs. BFC&#146;s NOL carryforwards include approximately $12.3&nbsp;million that
are attributed to the exercise of stock options, and the tax benefits will be recognized in the
financial statements until such deductions are utilized to reduce taxes payable. As a result of
the merger of Woodbridge into BFC in September of 2009, BFC has likely undergone a &#147;change of
ownership&#148; as that term is defined in the Internal Revenue Code. This change of ownership will
result in a significant limitation of the amount of net operating losses that can be utilized by
BFC annually. However, Woodbridge&#146;s pre-merger NOL&#146;s are available to be used by BFC and are not
subject to this limitation. On September&nbsp;21, 2009, BFC adopted the rights agreement described
elsewhere in this Report in an attempt to protect our ability to use available NOLs to offset
future taxable income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC&#146;s shift in business strategy, coupled with more recent economic developments, caused BFC
to reconsider its previously disclosed tax planning strategy wherein BFC had intended to sell
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock in order to generate sufficient taxable income to
utilize expiring NOLs. Because BFC believes that its best long term potential is more likely to
occur through the growth of the companies it controls, BFC&#146;s current business strategy is to hold
its investment in BankAtlantic Bancorp indefinitely and no longer intends to pursue such a tax
planning strategy. Accordingly, based on BFC&#146;s change in intent as to the expected manner of
recovery of its investment in BankAtlantic Bancorp, BFC reversed its deferred tax liability of
$29.3&nbsp;million during the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2008. BFC has the ability and intent to
increase its ownership in BankAtlantic Bancorp to a level sufficient to effectuate a tax-free
transaction. BFC also concluded that a valuation allowance was required because based on available
evidence it was determined that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred
tax asset will not be realized, and BFC is not generating sufficient taxable income to utilize the
benefit of the deferred tax asset. Therefore, BFC established a valuation allowance of
approximately $28.3&nbsp;million in 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September&nbsp;21, 2009, the date on which its merger with BFC was consummated, Woodbridge
had federal and Florida NOL carryforwards of approximately $109.2&nbsp;million and $201.0&nbsp;million,
respectively which expire beginning in 2027 through 2029. Woodbridge had established a valuation
allowance for its entire deferred tax assets, net of the deferred tax liabilities. Of the total net
operating loss carryforwards, approximately $66.2&nbsp;million were generated by Levitt and Sons after
filing for Bankruptcy protection. In August of 2008, Woodbridge received $29.7&nbsp;million from the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)&nbsp;in connection with the filing of a refund claim for the carry back
to 2005 and 2006 of tax losses incurred in 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the merger, Woodbridge was subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as to income
tax in multiple state jurisdictions. Woodbridge is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state and
local income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2005. On January&nbsp;8, 2009,
Woodbridge received a letter from the IRS that Woodbridge and its subsidiaries has been selected
for an examination of the tax periods ending December&nbsp;31, 2005, 2006 and 2007 in connection with
its 2007 tax refund claim. The examination was concluded in December of 2009. However, the refund
claim is subject to review by the Joint Committee on Taxation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen and its subsidiaries file income tax return in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and
various states and foreign jurisdictions. With certain exceptions, Bluegreen is no longer subject
to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examination by tax authorities for years
before 2004. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, Bluegreen&#146;s federal NOL carryforwards were $230&nbsp;million,
which expire beginning in 2022 through 2029, and alternative

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pizza Fusion files separate Federal and Florida income tax returns and is no longer subject to
U.S. federal, state and local income tax examination by tax authorities for years before 2006. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2009, Pizza Fusion&#146;s Federal and state NOL carryforwards was approximately $4
million which expire from 2027 through 2029.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return but
separate state income tax returns. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s state NOL carryforwards were $521.2
million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and expire from 2016 through 2029. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s income
tax returns for all years subsequent to the 2004 tax year are subject to examination. Various state
jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s 2005, 2007 and 2008
federal income tax returns are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service. No
other income tax filings are under examination by any other taxing authority.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to December&nbsp;31, 1996, BankAtlantic was permitted to deduct from taxable income an
allowance for bad debts which was in excess of the provision for such losses charged to income.
Accordingly, at December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp had $21.5&nbsp;million of excess allowance for
bad debts for which no provision for income tax has been provided. If, in the future, this portion
of retained earnings is distributed, or BankAtlantic no longer qualifies as a bank for tax
purposes, federal income tax of approximately $7.5&nbsp;million would be owed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, deferred tax assets included $136.9&nbsp;million, the amount of
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s federal income tax NOL carry-forwards of which $69.6&nbsp;million expire in 2028
and $67.3&nbsp;million expire in 2029. BankAtlantic Bancorp federal tax credit carry-forwards were $2.1
million at December&nbsp;31, 2009 and expire from 2025 to 2029.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2007, BankAtlantic decided to sell certain properties that it acquired
for its future store expansion program and to terminate or sublease certain back-office operating
leases. As a consequence, BankAtlantic recorded a $1.5&nbsp;million impairment charge for back-office
facilities and land acquired for store expansion, incurred a $3.3&nbsp;million impairment charge for
engineering and architectural fees associated with obtaining permits for store sites and recorded
lease termination liabilities of $1.0&nbsp;million associated with executed lease contracts. Sales
prices or annual rental rates for similar properties were used to determine fair value.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, BankAtlantic incurred $1.2&nbsp;million and $4.8
million of additional impairment charges for back-office facilities and land acquired for store
expansion and recorded additional lease termination liabilities of $2.2&nbsp;million and $0.2&nbsp;million
associated with executed lease contracts net of deferred rent reversals, respectively.

year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 were $2.6&nbsp;million of costs associated with one-time termination
benefits. These benefits included $0.3&nbsp;million of share-based compensation.

which owned two South Florida shopping centers were sold to an unaffiliated third party. The
Company received proceeds of approximately $1.3&nbsp;million in connection with the sale and BFC was
relieved of its guarantee related to the loans collateralized by the shopping centers. BFC believes
that any possible remaining obligations are both remote and immaterial.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At June&nbsp;30, 2009, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC/CCC, Inc. (&#147;BFC/CCC&#148;), had a 10% interest
in a limited partnership as a non-managing general partner. The partnership owns an office building
located in Boca Raton, Florida. In connection with the purchase of the office building in March
2006, BFC/CCC guaranteed repayment of a portion of the non-recourse loan on the property on a joint
and several basis with the managing general partner. BFC/CCC&#146;s maximum exposure under this
guarantee agreement is $2.0&nbsp;million (which is shared on a joint and several basis with the managing
general partner), representing approximately 8.5% of the current indebtedness of the property. In
July&nbsp;2009, BFC/CCC&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary withdrew as partner of the limited partnership and
transferred its 10% interest to another unaffiliated partner. In return, the partner to whom this
interest was assigned agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the release of BFC/CCC
from the guarantee, and if the partner is unable to secure such a release, that partner has agreed
to indemnify BFC/CCC&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary for any losses that may arise under the guarantee
after the date of the assignment. There are no carrying amounts on our financial statements at
December&nbsp;31, 2009 for this joint venture.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC/CCC has a 10% interest in a limited liability company that
owns two commercial properties in Hillsborough County, Florida. At December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, the
carrying amount of this investment was approximately $690,000 and $743,000, respectively, which is
included in investments in unconsolidated affiliates in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of

2006, BFC and the unaffiliated member each guaranteed the payment of up to a maximum of $5.0
million each for certain environmental indemnities and specific obligations that are not related to
the financial performance of the assets. BFC and the unaffiliated member also entered into a cross
indemnification agreement which limits BFC&#146;s obligations under the guarantee to acts of BFC and its
affiliates.

approximately $319,000 and $485,000, respectively, which is included in investments in
unconsolidated affiliates in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition. In

similar state insolvency laws or in the event of any transfers of interests not in accordance with

approximately $860,000 and $8.2&nbsp;million, respectively, which were related primarily to its
obligations to various governmental entities to construct improvements in its various communities.
It is estimated that approximately $495,000 of work remains to complete these improvements and it
is not currently anticipated that any outstanding surety bonds will likely be drawn upon.

of the filing of the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. In the event that these obligations are drawn and paid by
the surety, Woodbridge could be responsible for up to $8.0&nbsp;million plus costs and expenses in
accordance with the surety indemnity agreements executed by Woodbridge. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and
2008, Woodbridge had $527,000 and $1.1&nbsp;million, respectively, in surety bond accruals related to
certain Levitt and Sons bonds where management believes it to be probable that Woodbridge will be
required to reimburse the surety under applicable indemnity agreements. Woodbridge reimbursed
approximately $348,000 during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 in accordance with the indemnity
agreement for bond claims paid during the period compared to $532,000 in reimbursements made during
the same 2008 period. It is unclear whether and to what extent the remaining outstanding surety
bonds of Levitt and Sons will be drawn and the extent to which Woodbridge may be responsible for
additional amounts beyond this accrual. There is no assurance that Woodbridge will not be
responsible for amounts in excess of the $527,000 accrual. Woodbridge will not receive any
repayment, assets or other consideration as recovery of any amounts it may be required to pay. In
September&nbsp;2008, a surety filed a lawsuit to require Woodbridge to post collateral against a portion
of its surety bonds exposure in connection with demands made by a municipality. Woodbridge believes
that the municipality does not have the right to demand payment under the bonds and initiated a
lawsuit against the municipality. Because Woodbridge does not believe a loss is probable,
Woodbridge did not accrue any amount in connection with this claim as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. As
claims have been made on the bonds, the surety requested that Woodbridge post a $4.0&nbsp;million escrow
deposit as security while the matter is litigated with the municipality and Woodbridge has complied
with that request.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend funds to a customer subject to conditions
established in the commitment. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future
cash requirements at December&nbsp;31, 2009. BankAtlantic has $45.7&nbsp;million of commitments to extend
credit at a fixed interest rate and $413.5&nbsp;million of commitments to extend credit at a variable
rate. BankAtlantic evaluates each customer&#146;s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount
of collateral required by BankAtlantic in connection with an extension of credit is based on
management&#146;s credit evaluation of the counter-party.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by BankAtlantic to guarantee the

issued to customers in the construction industry guaranteeing project performance. These types of
standby letters of credit had a maximum exposure of $10.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009.
BankAtlantic also issues standby letters of credit to commercial lending customers guaranteeing the
payment of goods and services. These types of standby letters of credit had a maximum exposure of
$3.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and
private borrowing arrangements and generally have maturities of one year or less. The credit risk
involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan
facilities to customers. BankAtlantic may hold certificates of deposit and residential and
commercial liens as collateral for such commitments which are collateralized similar to other types
of borrowings. Included in other liabilities at December&nbsp;31, 2009 was $5,000 of unearned guarantee
fees. There were no obligations recorded in the financial statements associated with these
guarantees.

of the lease to a third party; however, BankAtlantic remains secondarily liable for the lease
obligation. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic was secondarily liable for $10.7&nbsp;million of
lease payments associated with lease assignments. BankAtlantic uses the same credit policies in
assigning these leases to third parties as it does in originating loans. BankAtlantic recognized a

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC has a share based compensation plan (the &#147;2005 Stock Incentive Plan&#148;) under which
restricted stock, incentive stock options and non-qualifying stock options are awarded. On May&nbsp;19,
2009, the shareholders of BFC approved an amendment to the Company&#146;s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan to,
among other things, increase the maximum number of shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
available for grant under the BFC Stock Incentive Plan from 3,000,000 shares to 6,000,000 shares.
BFC may grant incentive stock options only to its employees. BFC may grant non-qualified stock
options and restricted stock awards to its directors, independent contractors and agents as well as
employees.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC also had a stock-based compensation plan (&#147;1993 Plan&#148;) which expired in 2004. No future
grants can be made under the 1993 Plan; however, any previously issued options granted under that
plan remain effective until either they expire, are forfeited, or are exercised. BFC&#146;s 1993 Plan
provided for the grant of stock options to purchase shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;B Common Stock. The 1993
Plan provided for the grant of both incentive stock options and non-qualifying options and the
maximum term of the options was ten years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 1.8&nbsp;million shares of
common stock, which were previously granted to and held by BFC&#146;s directors and employees, were
re-priced to a new exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
as quoted on the Pink Sheets Electronic Quotation Service on September&nbsp;21, 2009. The re-pricing did
not impact any of the other terms, including the vesting schedules or expiration dates, of the
previously granted stock options. The incremental compensation cost of the re-priced vested options
was approximately $157,000 which was recognized in September&nbsp;2009. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the
remaining incremental cost for the re-priced options that were unvested at the re-pricing date was
approximately $125,000 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.42
years. The incremental compensation cost associated with the unvested options recognized through
December&nbsp;31, 2009 was approximately $32,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, on September&nbsp;21, 2009, following the Woodbridge merger, new options to purchase
an aggregate of 753,254 shares of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.41 per share
were granted principally to Woodbridge&#146;s directors, executive officers and employees. The weighted
average estimated fair value of the options granted on September&nbsp;21, 2009 was approximately $0.22
per share and the resulting compensation cost of approximately $166,000 is expected to be
recognized over the requisite service period of four years. The options expire in five years and
the options will vest in four equal annual installments beginning on September&nbsp;21, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assumptions used in estimating the fair value of employee options granted were formulated in
accordance with FASB guidance under stock compensation and the guidance provided by the SEC. As
part of this assessment, management determined that volatility should be based on the Company&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and derived from historical price volatility over the estimated life of the
stock options granted. The expected term of an option is an estimate as to how long the option will
remain outstanding based upon management&#146;s expectation of employee exercise and post-vesting
forfeiture behavior. Because there were no recognizable patterns, the simplified guidance was used
to determine the estimated term of options based on the midpoint of the vesting term and the
contractual term. The estimate of a risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury implied
yield curve in effect at the time

has never paid cash dividends and does not currently intend to pay cash dividends on its common

stock options is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model net of an estimated
forfeitures rate and recognizes the compensation costs for those options expected to vest on a

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC recognized restricted stock compensation cost of approximately $42,000, $100,000 and
$158,000 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2008, the Board of Directors granted to non-employee directors an aggregate of 120,480
shares of restricted stock under the BFC Stock Incentive Plan. Restricted stock was granted in
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and vested monthly over the twelve-month service period. The fair value of the
120,480 shares of restricted stock was approximately $100,000, and the cost was recognized over the
12&nbsp;month service period from June&nbsp;2008 through May&nbsp;2009.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the merger, Woodbridge had in place a stock compensation plan. The maximum term of
options granted under the plan was 10&nbsp;years. The vesting period for each grant was established by
the Compensation Committee of Woodbridge&#146;s Board of Directors. The vesting period for employees was
generally five years utilizing cliff vesting. All options granted to directors vested immediately.
Option awards issued became exercisable based solely on fulfilling a service condition. As of the
date of the merger, no stock options granted under the plan had expired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon consummation of the merger on September&nbsp;21, 2009, all options to purchase shares of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock outstanding at the effective time of the merger were canceled and
the holders did not receive any consideration as a result of the cancellation. Restricted shares
of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock were converted to restricted shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock at the merger exchange ratio of 3.47 shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock for each share of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. Some of the directors, executive officers and employees of
Woodbridge were also granted BFC stock options following the merger.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of Woodbridge&#146;s stock. Due to the
short period of time that Woodbridge&#146;s stock was publicly traded, the historical volatilities of
similar publicly traded entities were reviewed to validate Woodbridge&#146;s expected volatility
assumption. The expected dividend yield was based on an expected quarterly dividend.
Historically, forfeiture rates were estimated based on historical employee turnover rates. In 2007
and 2008, there were substantial pre-vesting forfeitures as a result of the reductions in force
related to the bankruptcy of Levitt and Sons and Woodbridge&#146;s restructurings. See Note 26 for
further information regarding restructuring charges. As a result, Woodbridge adjusted its stock
compensation to reflect actual forfeitures. In accordance with the accounting guidance for stock
compensation, pre-vesting forfeitures result in a reversal of compensation cost whereas a
post-vesting cancellation would not.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp recognizes stock based compensation costs based on the grant date
fair value. The grant date fair value for stock options is calculated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model incorporating an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizes the compensation
costs for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period
of the award, which is generally the option vesting term of five years. BankAtlantic Bancorp based
the estimated forfeiture rate of its nonvested options on its historical experience during the
preceding five years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp formulated its assumptions used in estimating the fair value of employee
options granted subsequent to January&nbsp;1, 2006 in accordance with guidance provided by the SEC. As
part of this assessment, management determined that the historical volatility of BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s stock should be adjusted to reflect the spin-off of Levitt Corporation (which was
subsequently renamed Woodbridge Holdings Corporation) on December&nbsp;31, 2003 because BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s historical volatility prior to the Levitt spin-off was not a good indicator of future
volatility. Management reviewed BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s stock volatility subsequent to the Levitt
spin-off along with the stock volatility of other companies in its peer group. Based on this
information, management determined that BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s stock volatility was similar to its
peer group subsequent to the spin-off. As a consequence, management estimates BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s stock volatility over the estimated life of the stock options granted using peer group
experiences instead of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s historical data for the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2007. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s stock price

historical volatility as an indicator of future volatility. As part of its adoption of new
accounting guidance on January&nbsp;1, 2006, BankAtlantic Bancorp examined its historical pattern of
option exercises in an effort to determine if there were any patterns based on certain employee
populations. From this analysis, BankAtlantic Bancorp could not identify any employee population
patterns in the exercise of its options. As such, BankAtlantic Bancorp used the guidance of SAB
107 to determine the estimated term of options issued subsequent to the adoption new accounting
guidance. Based on this guidance, the estimated term was deemed to be the midpoint of the vesting
term and the contractual term ((vesting term &#043; original contractual term)/2).

Mr.&nbsp;Gilbert retired as Chief Financial Officer on March&nbsp;29, 2007. On September&nbsp;13, 2005, as
actuarially determined, BFC recorded the present value of the retirement benefit payment in the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;29, 2008, Woodbridge&#146;s board approved the terms of an incentive program for
certain employees, including certain executive officers, pursuant to which a portion of their
compensation may be based on the cash returns realized on investments anticipated to be held by
individual limited partnerships or other legal entities. Certain of the participants in this
incentive program are employees and executive officers of BFC. This incentive program qualifies as
a liability-based plan and, accordingly, the components of the program are required to be evaluated
in order to determine the estimated fair value of the liability, if any, to be recorded. Based on
the evaluation performed at December&nbsp;31, 2009, it was determined that the liability for
compensation under the executive compensation program as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 was not material.

an annual basis, and changes in such assumptions may impact future pension costs. The discount rate
assumption is based on rates of high quality corporate bonds. The interest rates of high quality
corporate bonds remained unchanged from December&nbsp;31, 2007. The expected long-term rate of return
was estimated using historical long-term returns based on the expected asset allocations. Current
participant data was used for the actuarial assumptions for each of the three years ended December
31, 2009. BankAtlantic Bancorp did not make any contributions to the BankAtlantic Plan during the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. BankAtlantic Bancorp will be required to contribute
$1.6&nbsp;million to the BankAtlantic Plan for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan&#146;s investment policies and strategies are to invest in mutual funds that are rated
with at least a 3-star rating awarded by Morningstar at the initial purchase. If a fund&#146;s
Morningstar rating falls below a 3-star rating after an initial purchase, it is closely monitored
to ensure that its under-performance can be attributed to market conditions rather than fund
management deficiencies. Fund manager changes or changes in fund objectives could be cause for
replacement of any mutual fund. The Plan also maintains an aggressive growth investment category
which includes investments in equity securities and mutual funds. Both public and private
securities are eligible for this category of investment, but no more than 5% of total Plan assets
at the time of the initial investment may be invested in any one company. Beyond the initial cost
limitation (5% at time of purchase), there will be no limitation as to the percentage that any one
investment can represent if it is achieved through growth. As a means to reduce negative market
volatility, and to invoke a sell discipline for concentrated positions, the Plan has a strategy of
selling call options against certain stock positions within the portfolio when considered timely.
At December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2.4% of the Plan&#146;s assets were invested in the aggressive growth category.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan&#146;s targeted asset allocation was 72% equity securities, 25% debt securities and 3%
cash during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. A rebalancing of the portfolio takes place on a
quarterly basis when there has been a 5% or greater change from the prevailing benchmark
allocation.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp established the Profit Sharing Stretch Plan for all employees of the

During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp replaced the profit sharing plan

</DIV>
<!-- xbrl,body -->


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;7, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company designated 15,000 shares of its
authorized preferred stock as 5% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (&#147;5% Preferred Stock&#148;). On
June&nbsp;21, 2004, the Company sold all 15,000 shares of the Preferred Stock to an investor group in a
private offering.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5% Preferred Stock has a stated value of $1,000 per share. The shares of 5% Preferred
Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Company, from time to time, at redemption prices (the
&#147;Redemption Price&#148;) ranging from $1,025 per share for the year 2010 to $1,000 per share for the
year 2015 and thereafter. The 5% Preferred Stock liquidation preference is equal to its stated
value of $1,000 per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends or an amount equal to the
Redemption Price in a voluntary liquidation or winding up of the Company. Holders of the 5%
Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors,
cumulative quarterly cash dividends on each such share at a rate per annum of 5% of the stated
value from the date of issuance, payable quarterly. Since June&nbsp;2004, the Company has paid quarterly
dividends on the 5% Preferred Stock of $187,500. The 5% Preferred Stock has no voting rights except
as required by Florida law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;17, 2008, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation (the &#147;Amendment&#148;) to
change certain of the previously designated relative rights, preferences and limitations of the
Company&#146;s 5% Preferred Stock. The Amendment eliminated the right of the holders of the 5% Preferred
Stock to convert their shares of 5% Preferred Stock into shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock. The Amendment also requires the Company to redeem shares of the 5% Preferred Stock with the
net proceeds it receives in the event (i)&nbsp;the Company sells any of its shares of Benihana Series&nbsp;B
Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#147;Benihana Preferred Stock&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;the Company sells any shares of
Benihana&#146;s common stock received upon conversion of the Benihana Preferred Stock or (iii)&nbsp;Benihana
redeems any shares of the Benihana Preferred Stock owned by the Company. Additionally, in the
event the Company defaults on its obligation to make dividend payments on its 5% Preferred Stock,
the Amendment entitles the holders of the 5% Preferred Stock, in place of the Company, to receive
directly from Benihana certain payments on the shares of Benihana Preferred Stock owned by the
Company or on the shares of Benihana&#146;s common stock received by the Company upon conversion of the
Benihana Preferred Stock.

Amendment, the Company determined that BFC 5% Preferred Stock met the requirements to be
re-classified outside of permanent equity at its fair value at the Amendment date of approximately
$11.0&nbsp;million into the mezzanine category as Redeemable 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock. The
remaining amount of approximately $4.0&nbsp;million continued to be classified as Additional Paid in
Capital in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The fair value of the 5%
Preferred Stock was calculated by using an income approach by discounting estimated cash flows at a
market discount rate.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, BFC adopted a rights agreement (&#147;Rights Agreement&#148;) designed to
preserve shareholder value and protect our ability to use available net operating loss (&#147;NOLs&#148;)
carryforwards. The Rights Agreement provides a deterrent to shareholders from acquiring a 5% or
greater ownership interest in BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock without the prior
approval of BFC&#146;s Board of Directors. Shareholders of BFC at September&nbsp;21, 2009 were not required
to divest any shares. The Rights Agreement was substantially similar to the rights agreement that
Woodbridge had in place prior to the consummation of the merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the merger, on September&nbsp;21, 2009, BFC&#146;s Articles of Incorporation were
amended to increase the number of authorized shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock from 100,000,000
shares to 150,000,000 shares. BFC also amended its Articles of Incorporation on September&nbsp;21, 2009
to set forth the designation and number of preferred shares as well as the relative rights,
preferences and limitations of the preferred shares which may be issued under the terms and
conditions of the Rights Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, BFC&#146;s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program which
authorizes the repurchase of up to 20,000,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock at an
aggregate cost of no more than $10&nbsp;million. This program replaces the $10&nbsp;million repurchase
program that BFC&#146;s Board of Directors approved in October&nbsp;2006 which placed a limitation on the
number of shares which could be repurchased under the program at 1,750,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock. BFC previously repurchased 100,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock at an aggregate cost of
$54,000 under the prior program. The current program, like the prior program, authorizes
management, at its discretion, to repurchase shares from time to time subject to market conditions
and other factors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Articles of Incorporation authorize the Company to issue both Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock, par value $.01 per share, and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, par value $.01 per share. On May&nbsp;22,
2002, the Company&#146;s Articles of Incorporation were amended to, among other things, grant holders of
the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock one vote for each share held, with all holders of Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock possessing in the aggregate 22% of the total voting power. Prior to the amendment, the Class
A Common Stock had no voting rights except under limited circumstances provided by Florida law.
The amendment provided for the holders of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock to have the remaining 78% of the
total voting power. When the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock outstanding decreases to
1,800,000 shares, the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock&#146;s aggregate voting power will increase to 40% and the
Class&nbsp;B Common Stock will have the remaining 60%. When the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock
outstanding decreases to 1,400,000 shares, the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock&#146;s aggregate voting power will
increase to 53% and the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock will have the remaining 47%. These relative voting
percentages will remain fixed unless the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock outstanding
decreases to 500,000 shares or less, at which time the fixed voting percentages will be eliminated.
Each share of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock is convertible at the option of the holder thereof into one
share of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;3, 2007, the Board of Directors of BFC amended the Company&#146;s Bylaws to allow for
the issuance of uncertificated shares of the Company&#146;s capital stock. The Board of Directors
adopted this amendment, which became effective on December&nbsp;3, 2007, in response to applicable rules
and regulations which required securities listed on the NYSE Arca, including, at that time, BFC&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, to be eligible for a direct registration system by January&nbsp;2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;11, 2008, our Board of Directors amended our By-laws to include advance notice
procedures requiring, among other things, that a shareholder wishing to properly bring business
before an annual meeting of the Company&#146;s shareholders or nominate a candidate to serve on the
Board of Directors of the Company must deliver written notice of such business or nomination to the
Company&#146;s Secretary (i)&nbsp;not less than 90&nbsp;days nor more than 120&nbsp;days prior to the anniversary date
of the immediately preceding annual meeting of the Company&#146;s shareholders or (ii)&nbsp;in the event that
the annual meeting of the Company&#146;s shareholders is called for a date that is not within 30&nbsp;days
before or after the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of the Company&#146;s
shareholders, not later than the close of business on the tenth day after the earlier of notice of
the date of the annual meeting of shareholders is mailed or public disclosure of the date of the
annual meeting of shareholders is made.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, in connection with the consummation of the Woodbridge merger, our
Bylaws were further amended to increase the maximum size of the Board from 12 to 15 directors and
to provide that each director thereafter elected or appointed to the Board would serve for a term
expiring at our next Annual Meeting of Shareholders. As a result of the latter amendment,
following our 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, we will no longer have a staggered Board.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>33. Fair Value Measurement</B>
</DIV>

 <!-- xbrl,body -->

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair value is defined as the price that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
There are three main valuation techniques to measuring fair value of assets and liabilities: the
market approach, the income approach and the cost approach. The accounting literature defines an
input fair value hierarchy that has three broad levels and gives the highest priority to quoted
prices (unadjusted)&nbsp;in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valuation techniques are summarized below:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income approach uses financial models to convert future amounts to a single present
amount. These valuation techniques include present value and option-pricing models.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the
service capacity of an asset. This technique is often referred to as current replacement costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The input fair value hierarchy is summarized below:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted)&nbsp;in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at each reporting date. An active market for
the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. A quoted price
in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and is used to measure fair
value whenever available.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable
for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a
specified (contractual)&nbsp;term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of
the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in
active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are
not active, that is, markets in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the
prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market
makers (for example, some brokered markets), or in which little information is released publicly
(for example, a principal-to-principal market); inputs

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair values of mortgage-backed and real estate mortgage conduit securities are estimated
using independent pricing sources and matrix pricing. Matrix pricing uses a market approach
valuation technique and Level 2 valuation inputs as quoted market prices are not available for the
specific securities that BankAtlantic owns. The independent pricing sources value these
securities using observable market inputs including: benchmark yields, reported trades,
broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads and other reference data in the secondary institutional
market which is the principal market for these types of assets. To validate fair values obtained
from the pricing sources, BankAtlantic reviews fair value estimates obtained from brokers,
investment advisors and others to determine the reasonableness of the fair values obtained from
independent pricing sources. BankAtlantic reviews any price that it determines may not be
reasonable and requires the pricing sources to explain the differences in fair value or reevaluate
its fair value.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impaired loans are generally valued based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.
Third party appraisals are primarily used to assist in non-homogenous impaired loans. These
appraisals generally use the market or income approach valuation technique and use market
observable data to formulate an opinion of the fair value of

fair value of the collateral or properties and BankAtlantic may also adjust these values for
changes in market conditions subsequent to the appraisal date. When current appraisals are not
available for certain loans, BankAtlantic uses judgment on market conditions to adjust the most
current appraisal. The sales prices may reflect prices of sales contracts not closed and the amount
of time required to sell out the real estate project may be derived from current appraisals of
similar projects. As a consequence, the calculation of the fair value of the collateral uses Level
3 inputs. Third party brokered price options or an automated valuation service are generally use
to measure the fair value of the collateral for impaired homogenous loans in the establishment of
specific reserves or charge-downs when these loans become 120&nbsp;days delinquent. These third party
valuations from real estate professionals use Level 3 inputs in the determination of the fair
values.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U><I>Private Equity Investments </I></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private investment securities represented investments in limited partnerships that invest in
equity securities based on proprietary investment strategies. The underlying equity investments in
these limited partnerships are generally publicly traded equity securities and the fair values of
these securities are obtained from the general partner. As the fair values of the underlying
securities in the limited partnership were obtained from the general partner and the inputs used
are proprietary to the limited partnership and not known to the Company, the fair value assigned to
these investments is considered Level 3.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U><I>Investment in Bluegreen</I></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company previously held an approximate 29% interest in Bluegreen&#146;s common stock. On
November&nbsp;16, 2009, the Company obtained additional shares of Bluegreen which resulted in the
Company having a controlling interest in Bluegreen. Accordingly Bluegreen&#146;s results since November
16, 2009 are consolidated in the Company&#146;s financial statements. See Note 4 for further
information. Prior to that time, the Bluegreen investment was accounted for under the equity
method. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the fair value of the Bluegreen investment was assessed using Level 1
inputs by using the closing price of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U><I>Investment in Unconsolidated Trusts</I></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value was assessed using Level 3 inputs by using then current rates and spreads that
were used to value the underlying subordinated trust debt securities which is primarily based upon
similarly rated corporate bonds.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U><I>Impaired Real Estate Inventory and Real Estate Owned</I></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real estate inventory and other long-lived real estate assets are evaluated for impairment on
a project-by-project basis in accordance with the accounting guidance for the impairment or
disposal of long-lived assets. In accordance with this accounting guidance, long-lived assets are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by
comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to
be generated by the asset, or by using appraisals of the related assets. Using estimated future
undiscounted cash flows or appraisals requires significant judgment and opinions in developing
estimates. Real estate may also be valued using third party offers to purchase, discounted cash
flows or broker price opinions. Appraisals generally use the market approach valuation technique
and use market observable data to formulate an opinion of the fair value of the properties.
However, the appraiser or brokers use professional judgment in determining the fair value of the
properties, and we may also adjust these values for changes in market conditions subsequent to the
valuation date when current appraisals are not available. As a consequence of using discounted cash
flows, broker price opinions, offers to purchase and adjustments to appraisals, the fair values of
the properties use Level 3 inputs in the determination of fair value.

franchisees to obtain financing were also considered. In addition, recent economic indicators and
the impact of the recession on discretionary income were weighed. Using estimated future discounted
cash flow valuation techniques requires significant judgments in developing fair value estimates,
which are considered a Level 3 valuation.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp used discounted cash flow valuation techniques in determining the fair
value of its reporting units in the test of goodwill for impairment. This method requires
assumptions for expected cash flows and applicable discount rates. The aggregate fair value of all
reporting units derived from the above valuation methodology was compared to BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
market capitalization adjusted for a control premium in order to determine the reasonableness of
the financial model output. A control premium represents the value an investor would pay above
minority interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective
company. BankAtlantic Bancorp used financial projections over a period of time considered
necessary to achieve a steady state of cash flows for each reporting unit. The primary assumptions
in the projections were anticipated loan, tax certificates and securities growth, interest rates
and revenue growth. The discount rates were estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model,
which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and unsystematic risk and
size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a
reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in the discount rate and terminal value assumptions
and, accordingly, minor changes in these assumptions could impact significantly the fair value
assigned to a reporting unit. Future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the
estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below
its carrying value. As a result of the significant judgments used in determining the fair value of
the reporting units, the fair values of the reporting units use Level 3 inputs in the determination
of fair value.

are segregated by category, and each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable
rate interest terms and by performing and non-performing categories.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of performing loans is calculated by using an income approach with Level 3
inputs. The fair value of performing loans is estimated by discounting forecasted cash flows
through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect the interest rate
risk inherent in the loan portfolio. The estimate of average maturity is based on BankAtlantic&#146;s
historical experience with prepayments for each loan classification, modified as required, by an
estimate of the effect of current economic and lending conditions. Management assigns a credit risk
premium and an illiquidity adjustment to these loans based on risk grades.

such as non-interest bearing demand deposits, savings and NOW accounts, and money market and
checking accounts, is shown in the above table at book value. The fair value of certificates of
deposit is based on an income approach with Level 3 inputs. The fair value is calculated by the
discounted value of contractual cash flows with the discount rate estimated using current rates
offered by BankAtlantic for similar remaining maturities.

practical expedient, BankAtlantic Bancorp used the NASDAQ price quotes of the public debentures to

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic has in the past purchased residential loans located throughout the country. The
majority of these residential loans are jumbo residential loans. A jumbo loan has a principal
amount above the industry-standard definition of conventional conforming loan limits. These
purchased loans could potentially now have outstanding loan balances significantly higher than
related collateral values in distressed areas of the country as a result of real estate value
declines in the housing markets. Also included in this purchased residential loan portfolio are
interest-only loans. The structure of these loans results in possible future increases in a
borrower&#146;s loan payments when the contractually required repayments change due to interest rate
movement and the required amortization of the principal amount. These payment increases could
affect a borrower&#146;s ability to meet the debt service on or repay the loan and lead to increased
defaults and losses. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic&#146;s residential loan portfolio included
$776.2&nbsp;million of interest-only loans, which represents 53.0% of the residential portfolio with 29%
of the principal amount of these interest-only loans secured by collateral located in California.
BankAtlantic has attempted to manage the credit risk associated with purchasing interest-only loans
by purchasing loans originated to borrowers that it believes to be credit worthy, with
loan-to-value and total debt to income ratios at origination within agency guidelines.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic has a high concentration of consumer home equity and commercial loans in the
State of Florida. Real estate values and general economic conditions have significantly
deteriorated from the origination dates of the loans. If the market conditions in Florida do not
improve or deteriorate further, BankAtlantic may be exposed to significant credit losses in this
portfolio.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial
information is available that is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in
assessing performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Reportable segments consist of one or
more operating segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, production
processes, type of customer, distribution system or regulatory environment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information provided for segment reporting is based on internal reports utilized by
management of the Company and its respective subsidiaries. The presentation and allocation of
assets and results of operations may not reflect the actual economic costs of the segments as stand
alone businesses. If a different basis of allocation were utilized, the relative contributions of
the segments might differ but the relative trends in segments&#146; operating results would, in
management&#146;s view, likely not be impacted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Woodbridge merger on September&nbsp;21, 2009 and the Bluegreen share acquisition
on November&nbsp;16, 2009, in each case as described above, the Company reorganized its reportable
segments to better align its segment reporting with the current operations of its businesses. The
Company&#146;s business activities currently consist of (i)&nbsp;Real Estate and Other activities and (ii)
Financial Services activities, which are reported through six segments: BFC Activities, Real Estate
Operations, Bluegreen Resorts, Bluegreen Communities, BankAtlantic and BankAtlantic Bancorp Parent
Company. As a result of this reorganization, our BFC Activities segment now includes, in addition
to other activities historically included in this segment, Woodbridge Other Operations (which was
previously a separate segment). Our Real Estate Operations segment is now comprised of what was
previously identified as our Land Division, including the real estate business activities of
Woodbridge and its subsidiaries, including Core Communities and Carolina Oak. In 2007, the Real
Estate Operations segment also included the operations of Levitt and Sons, which was deconsolidated
as of November&nbsp;9, 2007 in connection with the filing of its Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases, and Levitt
Commercial.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Real Estate and Other business activities are reported in four segments which
are i) BFC Activities ii) Real Estate Operations, iii) Bluegreen Communities and iv) Bluegreen
Resorts. BFC&#146;s consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of Bluegreen
from November&nbsp;16, 2009 (when we acquired a controlling interest in Bluegreen) through December&nbsp;31,
2009. Accordingly, Bluegreen&#146;s results of operations since November&nbsp;16, 2009 are reported through
the Bluegreen Resorts and Bluegreen Communities segments. Prior to November&nbsp;16, 2009, we owned
approximately 9.5&nbsp;million shares of Bluegreen common stock representing approximately 29% of such
stock, the investment in Bluegreen was accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In
prior years, the investment in Bluegreen was included in Woodbridge other operations, and our
interest in Bluegreen&#146;s earnings and losses prior to November&nbsp;16, 2009 are included in our BFC
Activities segment. The Company&#146;s Financial Services business activities include BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s results of operations and are reported in two segments: BankAtlantic and BankAtlantic
Bancorp Parent Company.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presentation and allocation of the assets, liabilities and results of operations of each
segment may not reflect the actual economic costs of the segment as a stand-alone business. If a
different basis of allocation were utilized, the relative contributions of the segment might differ
but, in management&#146;s view, the relative trends in segments would not likely be impacted.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vacation ownership and real estate industries are subject to extensive and complex
federal, state, and local governmental regulation. Federal, state, local and foreign environmental,
zoning, consumer protection and other statutes regulate the acquisition, subdivision, marketing and
sale of real estate and VOIs. On a federal level, the Federal Trade Commission has taken an active
regulatory role through the Federal Trade Commission Act, prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts and
unfair competition in interstate commerce. Vacation ownership interests are subject to various
regulatory requirements including state and local approvals. The laws of most states require the
filing of a detailed offering statement which provides disclosure of all material aspects of the
project and sale of VOIs. Laws in each state where VOIs are sold generally grant the purchaser of
a VOI the right to cancel a purchase contract at any time within a specified rescission period.
There is also no assurance that in the future, VOIs will not be deemed to be securities subject to
securities regulation. Most states also have other laws that regulate: real estate licensure;
sellers of travel licensure; anti-fraud laws; telemarketing laws; prize, gift and sweepstakes laws;
and, labor laws. In addition, the Company may be subject to the Fair Housing Act and various other
federal statutes and regulations. The sales and marketing of homesites are subject to various
consumer protection laws and to the Federal Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, which
establishes strict guidelines with respect to the marketing and sale of land in interstate
commerce.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no assurance that the cost of complying with applicable laws and regulations will not
be significant. Any failure to comply with current or future laws or regulations applicable to the
sale of VOIs or real estate could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC is a unitary savings bank holding company that owns approximately 36% of the outstanding
shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and all of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;B
common stock, which in the aggregate represent approximately 37% of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s common
stock and 66% of the total voting power of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s common stock. BankAtlantic
Bancorp is the holding company for BankAtlantic by virtue of its ownership of 100% of the
outstanding BankAtlantic common stock. BFC is subject to regulatory oversight and examination by
the OTS as discussed herein with respect to BankAtlantic Bancorp. BankAtlantic Bancorp is a unitary
savings bank holding company subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the OTS, including
normal supervision and reporting requirements. The Company, BankAtlantic Bancorp and Bluegreen are
each subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
&#147;Exchange Act&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s deposits are insured by the FDIC for up to $250,000 for each insured account
holder through December&nbsp;31, 2013 and $100,000 thereafter, the maximum amount currently permitted by
law. BankAtlantic has opted to insure its non-interest bearing and interest bearing deposits up to
50 basis point in an unlimited amount pursuant to the FDIC transaction account guarantee program.
BankAtlantic is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal
banking agencies. Failure to meet capital requirements can cause regulators to initiate certain
mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions that, if undertaken, could have a material
adverse effect on BFC&#146;s, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s, and BankAtlantic&#146;s financial condition and results
of operations. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, BankAtlantic met all capital adequacy requirements to which it
is subject and was considered a &#147;well capitalized&#148; institution.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability of BankAtlantic to pay dividends or make other distributions to BankAtlantic
Bancorp in subsequent periods is subject to regulations and OTS approval and is based upon
BankAtlantic&#146;s regulatory capital levels and net income. Because BankAtlantic has an accumulated
deficit during the prior two years, BankAtlantic is required to file an application to receive
approval of the OTS in order to pay dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp. The OTS would likely not
approve any distribution that would cause BankAtlantic to fail to meet its capital requirements or
if the OTS believes that a capital distribution by BankAtlantic constitutes an unsafe or unsound
action or practice. BankAtlantic Bancorp does not anticipate receiving dividends from BankAtlantic
during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 or until economic conditions and the performance of
BankAtlantic&#146;s assets improve. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
BankAtlantic paid $0, $15&nbsp;million and $20&nbsp;million, respectively, of dividends to BankAtlantic
Bancorp. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, BFC recognized approximately
$84,000, $208,000 and $1.7&nbsp;million, respectively, of dividends from BankAtlantic Bancorp. BFC does
not anticipate receiving dividends from BankAtlantic Bancorp during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2010. There are no restrictions on the payment of cash dividends by BFC. However, the Company has
never paid cash dividends.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s actual capital amounts and ratios are presented in the table and are compared
to the prompt corrective action (&#147;PCA&#148;) &#147;well capitalized&#148; and &#147;adequately capitalized&#148; ratios.
The OTS at its discretion may require BankAtlantic to maintain ratios greater than the PCA
standards (dollars in thousands):

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;21, 2009, we consummated our merger with Woodbridge, pursuant to which
Woodbridge became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC. For additional information see Note 3.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, BFC received dividends from
BankAtlantic Bancorp for approximately $84,000, $208,000 and $1.7&nbsp;million, respectively. These
dividends are included in operating activities in the Parent Company Condensed Statements of Cash
Flow.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2008, BFC (the parent company) increased its investment in a wholly-owned subsidiary
by converting a $3.7&nbsp;million note receivable that was due from the subsidiary into equity in that
subsidiary.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2008, BFC (the parent company) recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge
of $3.6&nbsp;million on its investment in Benihana Convertible Preferred which is included in expenses
in the Parent Company Condensed Statements of Operations. See Note 7 for further information.

2009 and 2008, respectively, representing amounts due in connection with the settlement of a class
action litigation that arose in connection with exchange transactions that BFC entered into in 1989
and 1991. BFC is required to repay this obligation as settlement holders submit their claims to
BFC. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company paid claims of
approximately $59,000, $10,300 and $17,900, respectively, related to this obligation.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Florida law, holders of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock who did not vote to approve
the Woodbridge merger and who properly asserted and exercised their appraisal rights with respect
to their shares (&#147;Dissenting Holders&#148;) are entitled to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to
the fair value of their shares (as determined in accordance with the provisions of Florida law) in
lieu of the shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock which they would otherwise have been entitled to
receive. Dissenting Holders, who owned in the aggregate approximately 4.6&nbsp;million shares of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, provided written notice to Woodbridge regarding their intent to
exercise their appraisal rights. In accordance with Florida law, Woodbridge provided written
notices and required forms to the Dissenting Holders setting forth, among other things, its
determination that the fair value of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock immediately prior to the
effectiveness of the merger was $1.10 per share. Dissenting Holders were required to return their
appraisal forms by November&nbsp;10, 2009 and indicate on their appraisal forms whether the Dissenting
Holder chose to (i)&nbsp;accept Woodbridge&#146;s offer of $1.10 per share or (ii)&nbsp;demand payment of the fair
value estimate determined by the Dissenting Holder plus interest. As of the date of this filing,
one Dissenting Holder which held approximately 400,000 shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
had withdrawn its shares from the appraisal rights process, while the remaining Dissenting Holders,
who collectively held approximately 4.2&nbsp;million shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, have
rejected Woodbridge&#146;s offer of $1.10 per share and requested payment for their shares based on
their respective fair value estimates of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. In December&nbsp;2009, the
Company recorded a $4.6&nbsp;million liability with a corresponding reduction to additional paid-in
capital representing, in the aggregate, Woodbridge&#146;s offer to the Dissenting Holders. However, the
appraisal rights litigation is currently ongoing and its outcome is uncertain. As a result, there
is no assurance as to the amount of cash that we will be required to pay to the Dissenting Holders,
which amount may be greater than the $4.6&nbsp;million that we have accrued.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;13, 2010, National Bank of South Carolina filed a complaint with the South Carolina
Court of Common Pleas, Fourteenth Judicial Circuit, to commence foreclosure proceedings related to
property at Tradition Hilton Head which served as collateral under a note and mortgage executed and
delivered by Core Communities of South Carolina in favor of the lender. With Core&#146;s concurrence,
the property was subsequently placed under the control of a receiver appointed by the court. Core
is secondarily liable to the lender as a guarantor but is not currently a party to the action.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;9, 2007, Levitt and Sons and substantially all of its subsidiaries collectively,
(&#147;the Debtors&#148;) filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases in the Bankruptcy
Court. The Debtors commenced the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases in order to preserve the value of their assets
and to facilitate an orderly wind-down of their businesses and disposition of their assets in a
manner intended to maximize the recoveries of all constituents. On November&nbsp;27, 2007, the Office
of the United States Trustee (the &#147;U.S. Trustee), appointed an official committee of unsecured
creditors in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases (the &#147;Creditors&#146; Committee&#148;). On January&nbsp;22, 2008, the U.S.
Trustee appointed a <I>Joint Home Purchase Deposit Creditors Committee of Creditors Holding Unsecured
Claims </I>(the &#147;Deposit Holders Committee&#148;, and together with the Creditors Committee, the
&#147;Committees&#148;) The Committees have a right to appear and be heard in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008, the Debtors asserted certain claims against Woodbridge, including an entitlement to a
portion of the $29.7&nbsp;million federal tax refund which Woodbridge received as a consequence of
losses incurred at Levitt and Sons in prior periods. However, on June&nbsp;27, 2008, Woodbridge entered
into a settlement agreement (the &#147;Settlement Agreement&#148;) with the Debtors and the Joint Committee
of Unsecured Creditors (the &#147;Joint Committee&#148;) appointed in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. Pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement, among other things, (i)&nbsp;Woodbridge agreed to pay to the Debtors&#146; bankruptcy
estates the sum of $12.5&nbsp;million plus accrued interest from May&nbsp;22, 2008 through the date of
payment, (ii)&nbsp;Woodbridge agreed to waive and release substantially all of the claims it had against
the Debtors, including its administrative expense claims through July&nbsp;2008, and (iii)&nbsp;the Debtors
(joined by the Joint Committee) agreed to waive and release any claims they had against Woodbridge
and its affiliates. After certain of Levitt and Sons&#146; creditors indicated that they objected to the

Woodbridge, the Debtors and the Joint Committee entered into an amendment to the Settlement
Agreement, pursuant to which Woodbridge would, in lieu of the $12.5&nbsp;million payment previously
agreed to, pay $8&nbsp;million to the Debtors&#146; bankruptcy estates and place $4.5&nbsp;million in a release
fund to be disbursed to third party creditors in exchange for a third party release and injunction.
The amendment also provided for an additional $300,000 payment by Woodbridge to a deposit holders

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;25, 2008, plaintiff Robert D. Dance filed a purported class action complaint as a
putative purchaser of our securities against us and certain of our officers and directors,
asserting claims under the federal securities law and seeking damages. This action was filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and is captioned Dance v.
Levitt Corp. et al., No.&nbsp;08-CV-60111-DLG. The securities litigation purports to be brought on
behalf of all purchasers of our securities beginning on January&nbsp;31, 2007 and ending on August&nbsp;14,
2007. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange
Act, and Rule&nbsp;10b-5 promulgated thereunder by issuing a series of false and/or misleading
statements concerning our financial results, prospects and condition.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This litigation arises from a dispute regarding liability under two performance bonds issued
in connections with a plat issued by the City of Brooksville for a single family housing project
that was not commenced and was abandoned prior to the bankruptcy of Levitt and Sons. Although the
property was deeded over to the lender as part of the bankruptcy, Woodbridge was a guarantor on the
bonds. The City of Brooksville contends that, notwithstanding that the single family project was
never commenced for which utilities were to be provided, it has a right to collect the cash sum of
the bonds in the amount of approximately $5.4&nbsp;million. Following Levitt and Sons&#146; failure, Key Bank
acquired the property and conveyed it to a buyer who negotiated a new agreement eliminating any
requirement for completing the planned utilities. Nonetheless, the City continued to assert rights
against the bonds. Woodbridge has fully secured the obligations of the surety under the bonds and
will be liable if the City&#146;s position is found to be correct.

of accommodations by timeshare owners, there is no assurance that we will be successful in

federal wage and hour laws, and were entitled to minimum wage and overtime pay consistent with the
FLSA. On July&nbsp;10, 2009, the parties settled the case and Bluegreen agreed to pay approximately

practices. The lawsuit does not seek to permanently restrain Bluegreen or any of its affiliates
from doing business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The parties have reached settlement on
this matter and on March&nbsp;15, 2010 Bluegreen signed a consent petition and forwarded it to the
Attorney General&#146;s office for counter-signature and filing with the appropriate court offices. As

maintained with the escrow agent pursuant to a purchase and sale contract for real property located

not to close on the purchase of the subject real property was proper under the
purchase and sale contract and therefore Bluegreen is entitled to a return of the full escrow
deposit. The seller has amended its complaint to include a fraud count.

Lesley et a1 v. Bluff Dale Development Corporation, Bluegreen Southwest One. L.P. et al.,</U> in
the 266th Judicial District Court, Erath County, Texas, the plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment
action against Southwest seeking to develop their reserved mineral interests in, on and under the
Mountain Lakes subdivision. The plaintiffs&#146; claims are based on property law, oil and gas law,
contract and tort theories. The property owners association and some of the individual landowners
have filed cross actions against Bluegreen, Southwest and individual directors of the property
owners association related to the mineral rights and certain amenities in the subdivision as
described below. On January&nbsp;17, 2007, the court ruled that the restrictions placed on the
development that prohibited oil and gas production and development were invalid and not enforceable
as a matter of law, that such restrictions did not prohibit the development of the plaintiffs&#146;
prior reserved mineral interests and that Southwest breached its duty to lease the minerals to
third parties for development. The court further ruled that Southwest was the sole holder of the
right to lease the minerals to third parties. The order granting the plaintiffs&#146; motion was
severed into a new cause styled Cause No.&nbsp;28769 <U>Betty Yvon Lesley et a1 v. Bluff Dale
Development Corporation, Bluegreen Southwest One. L.P. et al.</U> in the 266th Judicial District
Court, Erath County, Texas. Southwest appealed the trial court&#146;s ruling. On January&nbsp;22, 2009, in
<U>Bluegreen Southwest One, L.P. et al. v. Betty Yvon Lesley et al.</U>, in the 11th Court of
Appeals, Eastland, Texas, the Appellate Court reversed the trial court&#146;s decision and ruled in
Southwest&#146;s favor and determined that all executive rights were owned by Southwest and then
transferred to the individual property owners in connection with the sales of land. All property
owner claims were decided in favor of Southwest. It was also decided that Southwest did not breach
a fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs as an executive rights holder. As a result of this decision, no
damages or attorneys&#146; fees are owed to the plaintiffs. On May&nbsp;14, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an
appeal with the Texas Supreme Court asking the Court to reverse the Appellate Court&#146;s decision in
favor of Bluegreen. No information is available as to when the Texas Supreme Court will render a
decision as to whether or not it will take the appeal.

Corporation (formerly Levitt Corporation) became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC upon consummation
of the merger described throughout this report on September&nbsp;21, 2009. Prior to the merger, BFC held
an approximately 59% voting interest in Woodbridge. BFC also has a direct non-controlling interest
in Benihana. Shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B common stock representing a majority of BFC&#146;s

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the terms of shared service agreements between BFC, BankAtlantic Bancorp, and
Woodbridge, subsidiaries of BFC provide shared service operations in the areas of human resources,
risk management, investor relations, executive office administration and other services to
BankAtlantic Bancorp, Woodbridge and Bluegreen. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, the aggregate costs of the shared service operations allocated to BankAtlantic Bancorp and
Woodbridge were approximately $2.9&nbsp;million, $2.7&nbsp;million and $2.4&nbsp;million, respectively. Amounts
related to BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge were eliminated in the Company&#146;s consolidated
financial statements. Additionally, BFC provides certain risk management and administrative
services to Bluegreen. The costs of shared services are allocated based upon the usage of the
respective services. Also, as part of the shared service arrangement, BFC pays Bluegreen for
certain office facilities costs. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, BFC
allocated to Bluegreen approximately $483,000, $354,000 and $391,000, respectively, of shared
service operations, net of the office facilities costs. Amounts related to services provided to

BFC and BFC Shared Service rent office space in BankAtlantic&#146;s corporate headquarters. The
amendment increased the aggregate monthly rent that BFC and BFC Shared Service pay BankAtlantic
under these leases to $25,357, effective April&nbsp;1, 2009. Prior to April&nbsp;1, 2009, the aggregate

</DIV>
<!-- xbrl,body -->

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has two classes of common stock outstanding. The two-class method is not presented
in the table below because the Company&#146;s capital structure does not provide for different dividend
rates or other preferences, other than voting rights, between the two classes. The number of
options considered outstanding shares for diluted earnings per share is based upon application of
the treasury stock method to the options outstanding as of the end of the period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed above, during November&nbsp;2007, I.R.E. RAG, an approximately 45.5% owned subsidiary
of the Company, was merged with and into the Company. Prior to the merger, I.R.E. RAG owned
4,764,285 shares of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and 500,000 shares of our Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, all of
which were considered outstanding. However, because the Company owned 45.5% of the outstanding
common stock of I.R.E. RAG, 2,165,367 shares of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and 227,250 shares of our
Class&nbsp;B Common Stock were eliminated from the number of shares outstanding for purposes of
computing earnings per share. As a result, the merger with I.R.E. RAG neither increased the number
of shares of BFC Class&nbsp;A Common Stock or Class&nbsp;B Common Stock outstanding nor changed the
outstanding shares for calculating earnings (loss)&nbsp;per share.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;16, 2009, BFC purchased approximately 7.4&nbsp;million additional shares of
Bluegreen&#146;s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $23&nbsp;million. As a result
of the share purchase, BFC currently owns 52% of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock and accordingly has a
controlling interest in Bluegreen. As such, the Bluegreen acquisition has been accounted for as a
business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the guidance
issued by FASB which became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2009. See Note 4 for additional information
about the methods used in valuing the net assets of Bluegreen and the approximately $183.1&nbsp;million
gain from the purchase.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2009 BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s provision for loan losses increased
to $81.3&nbsp;million primarily due to commercial real estate charge-offs and increased allowance for
commercial real estate loan losses. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we also recorded additional
impairment charges of approximately $67.7&nbsp;million and $6.5&nbsp;million associated with Core and
Carolina Oak&#146;s real estate inventory, and property and equipment, respectively. The Company also
recorded approximately $13.6&nbsp;million of impairment charges related to Core&#146;s commercial leasing
projects for sale in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter results were also impacted by $7.7
million of impairments charges associated with real estate owned and unfavorable lease contracts.

million (net of purchase accounting) was recognized and an $81.3&nbsp;million deferred tax valuation
allowance was established. The deterioration in real estate values and the general economy
resulted in a $38.5&nbsp;million provision for loan losses. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of
2008, Woodbridge established an additional impairment on its investment in Bluegreen and its
investment in unconsolidated trusts of approximately $40.8&nbsp;million and $2.1&nbsp;million, respectively,
as well as an impairment charge on its investment in Office Depot of approximately $12.0&nbsp;million.
Also, in December&nbsp;2008, BFC recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $3.6&nbsp;million on
its investment in Benihana Convertible Preferred Stock (see Note 7).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) to make known material information concerning the Company, including its
subsidiaries, to those officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of our
senior management. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, our management evaluated, with the participation of
our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, our disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial
Officer and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that, as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief
Accounting Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all improper conduct. A control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must
be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
improper conduct, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
Further, the design of any control system is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f). Internal control
over financial reporting includes controls over the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with the instruction to the consolidated financial statements for savings and loan
holding companies (OTS Form&nbsp;H-(b) 11) to comply with the reporting requirements of Section&nbsp;112 of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. Our internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As of December&nbsp;31,
2009, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial
Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in <I>Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework </I>issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on such
evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In
addition, see &#147;Scope of Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting&#148; below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered certified public accounting firm, has
audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2009
as stated in its report which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Item&nbsp;8 &#147;Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As described throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on November&nbsp;16, 2009, we acquired
additional shares of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock. As a result of such share acquisition, we currently
have a controlling interest in Bluegreen after previously holding approximately 29% of Bluegreen&#146;s
common stock. While our financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 include the
results of Bluegreen from the November&nbsp;16, 2009 acquisition date through December&nbsp;31, 2009, as
permitted by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, our management&#146;s
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting did not include an evaluation of
Bluegreen&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Further, our management&#146;s conclusion
regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31,
2009 does not extend to Bluegreen&#146;s internal control over financial reporting.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our $6.0&nbsp;billion of consolidated assets at December&nbsp;31, 2009 included Bluegreen&#146;s total assets
of approximately $894.2&nbsp;million as of that date. In addition, our $393.8&nbsp;million of consolidated
revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 included revenues of approximately $29.6&nbsp;million
generated by Bluegreen during the period from the November&nbsp;16, 2009 acquisition date through
December&nbsp;31, 2009, and our net loss of $96.7&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 included
net income of $1.0&nbsp;million recognized by Bluegreen from November&nbsp;16, 2009 through December&nbsp;31,
2009.
