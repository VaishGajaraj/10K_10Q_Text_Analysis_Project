</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a diversified holding company whose major holdings include controlling interests in
BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (&#147;BankAtlantic Bancorp&#148;) and
Woodbridge Holdings Corporation (formerly known as Levitt Corporation) and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries (&#147;Woodbridge&#148;) and a noncontrolling interest in Benihana, Inc., which operates
Asian-themed restaurant chains in the United States. As a result of the Company&#146;s position as the
controlling shareholder of BankAtlantic Bancorp, BFC is a &#147;unitary savings bank holding company&#148;
regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, BFC&#146;s business strategy has been to invest in and acquire businesses in diverse
industries either directly or through controlled subsidiaries. BFC believes that the best potential
for growth is likely through the growth of the companies it currently controls and its focus is to
provide overall support for its controlled subsidiaries with a view to the improved performance of
the organization as a whole.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a holding company with controlling positions in BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge,
generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) requires the consolidation of the financial
results of both entities. As a consequence, the assets and liabilities of both entities are
presented on a consolidated basis in BFC&#146;s financial statements. However, except as otherwise
noted, the debts and obligations of the consolidated entities are not direct obligations of BFC and
are non-recourse to BFC. Similarly, the assets of those entities are not available to BFC absent a
dividend or distribution. The recognition by BFC of income from controlled entities is determined
based on the total percent of economic ownership in those entities as shown in the table below.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge each completed a one-for-five reverse
split of its common stock. Where appropriate, amounts throughout this document have been adjusted
to reflect the reverse stock splits effected by BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge. The reverse
stock splits did not impact the Company&#146;s proportionate equity interest or voting rights in
BankAtlantic Bancorp or Woodbridge. BFC&#146;s ownership in BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge as of
December&nbsp;31, 2008 was as follows:

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May&nbsp;2008, we were notified by the NYSE Arca, Inc. that we did not meet the continuing
listing requirements of the NYSE Arca as the market value of our publicly held shares was not in
excess of $15&nbsp;million and the average closing price per share of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock was not
in excess of $1.00 for a consecutive 30 trading-day period. Pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the NYSE Arca, the Company was granted a six-month period to comply with these continued listing
requirements. Because compliance was not achieved within this six-month period the Company was
notified by the NYSE Arca that its Class&nbsp;A Common Stock was suspended from trading on the NYSE Arca
prior to the opening of the market on Tuesday, December&nbsp;9, 2008. Since, December&nbsp;9, 2008, BFC&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock has been quoted on the Pink Sheets Electronic Quotation Service (&#147;Pink
Sheets&#148;) under the ticker symbol &#147;BFCF.PK&#148;.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge each completed a one-for-five reverse
split of its common stock. The reverse stock splits did not impact the Company&#146;s proportionate
equity interest or voting rights in BankAtlantic Bancorp or Woodbridge. Where appropriate, amounts
throughout this document have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock splits effected by
BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2008, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Amendment to the Articles
of Incorporation (the &#147;Amendment&#148;) with the State of Florida to amend certain designated relative
rights, preferences and limitations for the Company&#146;s 5% Preferred Stock. For additional
information see Note 34 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item&nbsp;8 of this
report.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August&nbsp;2008 and December&nbsp;2008, BFC purchased an aggregate of 400,000 shares and 323,848
shares, respectively, of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock on the open market for an
aggregate purchase price of $2.8&nbsp;million and $1.1&nbsp;million, respectively. BFC&#146;s August&nbsp;2008 and
December&nbsp;2008 acquisitions of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock increased BFC&#146;s ownership
interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp by approximately 3.6% in August&nbsp;2008 and 2.9% in December&nbsp;2008 and
increased BFC&#146;s voting interest by approximately 2.1% in August&nbsp;2008 and 1.6% in December&nbsp;2008. The
acquisitions of additional shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp have been accounted for as step
acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item&nbsp;8 of this report for further information. BFC may in the future seek
to increase its ownership in BankAtlantic Bancorp but there is no assurance that it will be
successful.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;21, 2006, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to
1,750,000 shares of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock through open market or private transactions at an
aggregate cost of no more than $10&nbsp;million. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will
depend on market conditions, share price, trading volume and other factors, and there is no
assurance that the Company will repurchase shares during any period. No termination date was set
for the repurchase program. All shares repurchased by us will be cancelled and retired. In 2008,
the Company repurchased in the open market an aggregate of 100,000 shares for an aggregate purchase
price of $54,000 and 1,650,000 shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock remain available for
repurchase under the plan.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC&#146;s shift in business focus, coupled with more recent economic developments caused the
Company to reconsider its previously disclosed tax planning strategy wherein the Company had
intended to sell BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;A Common Stock in order to generate sufficient taxable
income to utilize expiring net operating loss (&#147;NOLs&#148;) carryforwards. Because BFC believes that its
best long term potential is more likely to occur through the growth of the companies it controls,
BFC&#146;s current business strategy is to hold its investment in BankAtlantic Bancorp indefinitely and
no longer intends to pursue such a tax planning strategy. Accordingly, based on the Company&#146;s
change in intent as to the expected manner of recovery of its investment in BankAtlantic Bancorp, the
Company reversed its deferred tax liability of $29.3&nbsp;million during the quarter ended September&nbsp;30,
2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to BFC&#146;s deferred tax asset resulting from its NOLs, a valuation allowance was
required because based on available evidence, it was determined that it is more likely than not
that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, and BFC is not generating sufficient
taxable income to utilize the benefit of the deferred tax asset. Because it is more likely than
not that the NOLs included in BFC&#146;s deferred tax assets will not be realized, the Company
established a valuation allowance of approximately $28.3&nbsp;million in 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developments relating to our subsidiaries, BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge are discussed

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We report our results of operations through five reportable segments, which are: BFC

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s results of operations in BankAtlantic Bancorp are included in our Financial

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>BFC Activities Segment</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BFC Activities segment includes all of the operations and all of the assets owned by BFC
other than BankAtlantic Bancorp and its subsidiaries and Woodbridge and its subsidiaries.
Additional information relating to the BFC Activities segment is included in the information set
forth in pages 79 through 84 of Item&nbsp;7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations and Note 4 &#150; Segment Reporting of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item&nbsp;8 of this report.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &#147;BFC Activities&#148; segment operations consist primarily of shared service operations.
Pursuant to the terms of shared service agreements between BFC, BankAtlantic Bancorp and
Woodbridge, BFC provides shared service operations in the areas of human resources, risk
management, investor relations, executive office administration and other services to BankAtlantic
Bancorp and Woodbridge. Additionally, BFC provides certain risk management and administrative
services to Bluegreen. The costs of shared services are allocated based upon the usage of the
respective services. This segment also includes BFC&#146;s overhead expenses, interest income and
dividend income from BFC&#146;s investment in Benihana&#146;s convertible preferred stock, the financial
results of a venture partnership that BFC controls, and financial results from BFC/CCC, Inc.
(formerly known as Cypress Creek Capital, Inc.) (&#147;BFC/CCC&#148;). BFC&#146;s equity investments include its
investment in shares of the Series&nbsp;B Convertible Preferred Stock of Benihana and securities in the
technology sector owned by a partnership that is included in the consolidated financial statements
of BFC as a result of BFC&#146;s status as a general partner of that partnership.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Benihana</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benihana is a NASDAQ-listed company with two listed classes of common shares: Common Stock
(BNHN)&nbsp;and Class&nbsp;A Common Stock (BNHNA). BFC owns 800,000 shares of Benihana Series&nbsp;B Convertible
Preferred Stock (&#147;Convertible Preferred Stock&#148;). The Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible
into an aggregate of 1,578,943 shares of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock at a conversion price of $12.6667,
subject to adjustment from time to time upon certain defined events. Based on the number of
currently outstanding shares of Benihana&#146;s capital stock, the Convertible Preferred Stock, if
converted, would represent an approximately 19% voting interest and an approximately 9.4% economic
interest in Benihana. Historically, the Company&#146;s investment in Benihana&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock has been

day of each calendar quarter. The Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to mandatory redemption at
the original issue price plus accumulated dividends on July&nbsp;2, 2014 unless the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock elect to extend the mandatory redemption
date to a later date not to extend beyond July&nbsp;2, 2024. In addition, the Convertible Preferred
Stock may be redeemed by Benihana for a limited period beginning three years from the date of issue
if the price of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock is at least $25.33 for sixty consecutive trading days. At
December&nbsp;31, 2008, the closing price of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock was $2.10 per share. The market
value of the Convertible Preferred Stock on an as if converted basis at December&nbsp;31, 2008 would
have been approximately $3.3&nbsp;million. During the quarter ended December 31, 2008, the Company performed
an impairment review of its investment in Benihana Convertible Preferred Stock  to determine if an impairment
adjustment was needed. Based on the evaluation and the review of various qualitative and quantitative factors,
including the decline in the underlying trading value of Benihana&#146;s common stock and the redemption
provisions, the Company determined that there was an other-than-temporary decline of approximately $3.6 million,
and accordingly, the investment was written down to its fair value of approximately $16.4 million. Concurrent
 with management&#146;s evaluation of the impairment of this investment at December 31, 2008, it made the
determination to reclassify this investment from investment securities which are carried at cost to investment
securities available for sale in accordance with SFAS No. 115, &#147;Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities.&#148;

of Incorporation with the State of Florida which requires the Company to redeem shares of the
Company&#146;s Preferred Stock with the net proceeds the Company may receive in the event (i)&nbsp;the
Company sells any of its shares of Benihana Preferred Stock, (ii)&nbsp;the Company sells any shares of
Benihana&#146;s common stock received upon conversion of the Benihana Preferred Stock or (iii)&nbsp;Benihana
redeems any shares of the Benihana Preferred Stock owned by the Company. Additionally, the
Amendment entitles the holders of the Preferred Stock to receive directly from Benihana certain
payments on the shares of Benihana Preferred Stock owned by the Company, in the event the Company
defaults on its obligation to make dividend payments on the Preferred Stock. See Note 34 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item&nbsp;8 of this report for further information.

deposits (demand deposit accounts, NOW checking accounts and savings accounts).
BankAtlantic&#146;s core deposits increased from approximately $600&nbsp;million as of
December&nbsp;31, 2001 to $2.2&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. We believe the
competitive market for deposits, the impact of the recession on our customers as
well as reduced confidence in the banking system negatively impacted the growth of
core deposits, which at December&nbsp;31, 2008 declined by $151.0&nbsp;million or 7% from
December&nbsp;31, 2007. While we believe that the decrease is a reflection of what is
happening in the market generally, we are implementing strategies which we believe
will enhance customer loyalty with our current customers and attract new customers

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Residential: </I>Historically, BankAtlantic has purchased residential loans in the secondary
markets that have been originated by other institutions. These loans, which are serviced by
independent servicers, are secured by properties located throughout the United States. When
BankAtlantic purchases residential loans, it evaluates the originator&#146;s underwriting of the loans
and, for most individual loans, performs confirming credit analyses. Residential loans are
typically purchased in bulk and are generally non-conforming loans under agency guidelines due to
the size of the individual loans. BankAtlantic sets general guidelines for loan purchases relating
to loan amount, type of property, state of residence, loan-to-value ratios, the borrower&#146;s sources
of funds, appraised amounts and loan documentation, but actual purchases will generally reflect
availability and market conditions, and may vary from BankAtlantic&#146;s general guidelines. The
weighted average FICO credit scores and loan-to-value ratios (calculated at the time of
origination) of purchased loans outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 was 742 and 68%, respectively,
and the original back end debt ratio was a weighted average of 33%. Included in these purchased
residential loans are interest-only loans. These loans result in possible future increases in a
borrower&#146;s loan payments when the contractually required repayments increase due to interest rate
adjustments and when required amortization of the principal amount commences. These payment
increases could affect a borrower&#146;s ability to repay the loan and lead to increased defaults and
losses. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic&#146;s residential loan portfolio included $980&nbsp;million of
interest-only loans, $44.8&nbsp;million of which will become fully amortizing and have interest rates
reset in 2009. The credit scores and loan-to-value ratios for interest-only loans are similar to
amortizing loans. BankAtlantic has attempted to manage the credit risk associated with these loans
by limiting purchases of interest-only loans to those originated to borrowers that it believes to
be credit worthy, with loan-to-value and total debt to income ratios within agency guidelines.
BankAtlantic does not purchase sub-prime, option-arm, &#147;pick-a-payment&#148; or negative amortizing
residential loans. Loans in the purchased residential loan portfolio generally do not have
prepayment penalties.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic also originates residential loans to customers that are then sold on a servicing
released basis to a correspondent. It also originates and holds certain residential loans, which
are made primarily to &#147;low to moderate income&#148; borrowers in accordance with requirements of the
Community Reinvestment Act. The underwriting of these loans generally follows government agency
guidelines and independent appraisers typically perform on-site inspections and valuations of the
collateral. The outstanding balance of the loans in this portfolio at December&nbsp;31, 2008 was $70
million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Commercial Real Estate: </I>BankAtlantic provides commercial real estate loans for acquisition,
development and construction of various types of properties including office buildings and retail
shopping centers. BankAtlantic also provides loans to acquire or refinance existing
income-producing properties. These loans are primarily secured by property located in Florida.
Commercial real estate loans are generally originated in amounts based upon the appraised value of
the collateral or estimated cost to construct, generally have a loan to value ratio at the time of
origination of less than 80%, and generally require that one or more of the principals of the
borrowing entity guarantee these loans. Most of these loans have variable interest rates and are
indexed to either prime or LIBOR rates.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, we made three categories of commercial real estate loans that we believe have
resulted in significant exposure to BankAtlantic based on declines in the Florida residential real
estate market. We discontinued the origination of these loan products in 2007. These categories
are builder land bank loans, land

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"> acquisition and development loans, and land acquisition, development and construction loans.
The builder land bank loan category consists of land loans to borrowers who have or had land
purchase option agreements with regional and/or national builders.&nbsp; These loans were originally
underwritten based on projected sales of the developed lots to the builders/option holders, and
timely repayment of the loans is primarily dependent upon the sale of the property pursuant to the
options.&nbsp; If the lots are not sold as originally anticipated, BankAtlantic anticipates that the
borrower may not be in a position to service the loan, with the likely result being an increase in
nonperforming loans and loan losses in this category.&nbsp; The land acquisition and development loan
category consists of loans secured by residential land which was intended to be developed by the
borrower and sold to homebuilders.&nbsp; We believe that the underwriting on these loans was generally
more stringent than builder land bank loans, as an option agreement with a regional or national
builder did not exist at the origination date. The land acquisition, development and construction
loans are secured by residential land which was intended to be fully developed by the borrower who
also might have plans to construct homes on the property.&nbsp;These loans generally involved property
with a longer investment and development horizon, are guaranteed by the borrower or individuals
and/or are secured by additional collateral or equity such that it is expected that the borrower
will have the ability to service the debt for a longer period of time.&nbsp;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic has historically sold participations in commercial real estate loans that it
originated, and administers the loan and provides participants periodic reports on the progress of
the project for which the loan was made. Major decisions regarding the loans are made by the
participants on either a majority or unanimous basis. As a result, BankAtlantic generally cannot
significantly modify the loans without either majority or unanimous consent of the participants.
BankAtlantic&#146;s sale of loan participations has the effect of reducing its exposure on individual
projects and was required in some cases, in order to comply with the regulatory &#147;loans to one
borrower&#148; limitations. BankAtlantic has also purchased commercial real estate loan participations
from other financial institutions and in such cases BankAtlantic may not be in a position to
control decisions made with respect to the loans.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Commercial Business</I>: BankAtlantic generally makes commercial business loans to medium sized
companies in Florida. It lends on both a secured and unsecured basis, although the majority of
its loans are secured. Commercial business loans are typically secured by the receivables,
inventory, equipment, real estate, and/or general corporate assets of the borrowers. Commercial
business loans generally have variable interest rates that are prime or LIBOR-based. These loans
are typically originated for terms ranging from one to five years.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Standby Letters of Credit and Commitments: </I>Standby letters of credit are conditional
commitments issued by BankAtlantic to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is the same as extending loans to customers.
BankAtlantic may hold certificates of deposit, liens on corporate assets and liens on residential
and commercial property as collateral for letters of credit. BankAtlantic issues commitments for
commercial real estate and commercial business loans.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Consumer: </I>Consumer loans primarily consist of loans to individuals originated through
BankAtlantic&#146;s retail network. Approximately 90% of originations are home equity lines of credit
secured by a first or second mortgage on the primary residence of the borrower. Approximately 20%
of home equity lines of credit balances are secured by a first mortgage on the property. Home
equity lines of credit have prime-based interest rates and generally mature in 15&nbsp;years. Other
consumer loans generally have fixed interest rates with terms ranging from one to five years. The
credit quality of consumer loans is adversely impacted by increases in the unemployment rate and
declining real estate values. During 2008, BankAtlantic experienced higher than historical losses
in this portfolio as a result of deteriorating economic conditions. In an attempt to address this
issue, BankAtlantic has adopted more stringent underwriting criteria for consumer loans which has
the effect of significantly reducing consumer loan originations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Small Business: </I>BankAtlantic originates small business loans to companies located primarily
in markets within BankAtlantic&#146;s store network. Small business loans are primarily originated on
a secured basis and generally do not exceed $1.0&nbsp;million for non-real estate secured loans and
$2.0&nbsp;million for real estate secured loans. These loans are generally originated with maturities
ranging from one to three years or upon demand; however, loans collateralized by real estate could
have terms of up to fifteen years. Lines of credit extended to small businesses are due upon
demand. Small business loans have either fixed or variable prime-based interest rates. During
2009, BankAtlantic intends to target small business lending to specific industries that it
believes may lead to profitable customer relationships.

guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies, such as mortgage-backed securities and real
estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs), which are accounted for as securities available for
sale. BankAtlantic&#146;s securities available for sale portfolio at December&nbsp;31, 2008 reflects a
decision to seek high credit quality and securities guaranteed by government sponsored enterprises
in an attempt to minimize credit risk in its investment portfolio to the extent possible. The
available for sale securities portfolio serves as a source of liquidity while at the same time
provides a means to moderate the effects of interest rate changes. The decision to purchase and
sell securities from time to time is based upon a current assessment of the economy, the interest
rate environment, and capital and liquidity strategies and requirements. BankAtlantic&#146;s

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Tax Certificates: </I>Tax certificates are evidences of tax obligations that are sold through
auctions or bulk sales by various state and local taxing authorities. Certain municipalities bulk
sale their entire tax certificates for the prior year by auctioning the portfolio to the highest
bidder instead of auctioning each property. The tax obligation arises when the property owner
fails to timely pay the real estate taxes on the property. Tax certificates represent a priority
lien against the real property for the delinquent real estate taxes. The minimum repayment to
satisfy the lien is the certificate amount plus the interest accrued through the redemption date,
plus applicable penalties, fees and costs. Tax certificates have no payment schedule or stated
maturity. If the certificate holder does not file for the deed within established time frames,
the certificate may become null and void and lose its value. BankAtlantic&#146;s experience with this
type of investment has generally been favorable because the rates earned are generally higher than
many alternative investments and substantial repayments typically occur over a one-year period.
During 2008, BankAtlantic discontinued acquiring tax certificates through bulk sale auctions as it
experienced higher than historical losses on legacy bulk purchased tax certificates which included
properties in distressed areas outside the State of Florida.

call options on recently purchased agency securities (&#147;covered calls&#148;). Management pursues this
periodic investment strategy when it believes it will generate non-interest income or
alternatively, the acquisition of agency securities on desirable terms. BankAtlantic had no
derivative investments outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parent Company (&#147;Parent&#148;) operations primarily consist of financing of the capital needs
of BankAtlantic and its subsidiaries and management of the asset work-out subsidiary and other
investments. In March&nbsp;2008, the Parent Company used a portion of its proceeds obtained from the
Ryan Beck sale to Stifel to form an asset work-out subsidiary which purchased from BankAtlantic
$101.5&nbsp;million of non-performing loans at BankAtlantic&#146;s carrying value. The work-out subsidiary
has entered into an agreement with BankAtlantic to service the transferred non-performing loans.
The Parent also has arrangements with BFC Financial Corporation (&#147;BFC&#148;) for BFC to provide certain
human resources, insurance management, investor relations, and other administrative services to the
Parent and its subsidiaries. The Parent obtains its funds from issuances of equity and debt
securities, proceeds from sales of investment securities, returns on portfolio investments,
repayments and pay downs of loans in its workout subsidiary and dividends from its subsidiaries.
The Parent provides funds to its subsidiaries as capital contributions for general corporate
purposes. The largest expense of the Parent Company is interest expense on junior subordinated
debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities. The Company has the right to
defer quarterly payments of interest on the junior subordinated debentures for a period not to
exceed 20 consecutive quarters without default or penalty. In February and March&nbsp;2009, the Company
notified the trustees under its junior subordinated debentures that it has elected to defer its
quarterly interest payments. During the deferral period, the respective trusts will likewise
suspend the declaration and payment of dividends on the trust preferred securities. Additionally,
during the deferral period, the Company will not pay dividends on or repurchase its common stock.
The Parent Company deferred the interest and dividend payments in order to preserve its liquidity
in response to current economic conditions.

The financial services industry is experiencing a severe downturn and there is increased

principally from other banks, savings institutions and other lenders. This competition could

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We compete for deposits with banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as
institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds and mutual
funds. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do, which could decrease the
deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to attract new deposits. Increased
competition for deposits could increase our cost of funds, reduce our net interest margin and
adversely affect our results of operations.

Banks &#151; QTL Test&#148; for a discussion of the QTL requirements. If we were to make a non-supervisory
acquisition of another savings institution or of a savings institution that meets the QTL test and
is deemed to be a savings institution by the OTS and that will be held as a separate subsidiary,
then we would become a multiple savings and loan holding company within the meaning of HOLA and
would be subject to limitations on the types of business activities in which we can engage. HOLA
limits the activities of a multiple savings institution holding company and its non-insured
institution subsidiaries primarily to activities permissible for bank holding companies under
Section 4(c) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to the prior approval of the OTS, and to
other activities authorized by OTS regulation.

forming certain types of subsidiaries or engaging in certain activities through its subsidiaries.
The OTS and the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to assess BankAtlantic&#146;s safety and soundness

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Loans to One Borrower</I>. Under HOLA, savings banks are generally subject to the same limits on
loans to one borrower as are imposed on national banks. Generally, under these limits, the total
amount of loans and extensions of credit made by a savings bank to one borrower or related group of
borrowers outstanding at one time and not fully secured by collateral may not exceed 15% of the
savings bank&#146;s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. In addition to, and separate from, the
15% limitation, the total amount of loans and extensions of credit made by a savings bank to one
borrower or related group of borrowers outstanding at one time and fully secured by
readily-marketable collateral may not exceed 10% of the savings bank&#146;s unimpaired capital and
unimpaired surplus. Readily-marketable collateral includes certain debt and equity securities and
bullion, but generally does not include real estate. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic&#146;s limit on
loans to one borrower was approximately $77.8&nbsp;million. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic&#146;s
largest aggregate amount of loans to one borrower was approximately $46.1&nbsp;million and the second
largest borrower had an aggregate balance of approximately $37.8&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>QTL Test</I>. HOLA requires a savings bank to meet a QTL test by maintaining at least 65% of its
&#147;portfolio assets&#148; in certain &#147;qualified thrift investments&#148; on a monthly average basis in at least
nine months out of every twelve months. A savings bank that fails the QTL test must either operate
under certain restrictions on its activities or convert to a bank charter. At December&nbsp;31, 2008,
BankAtlantic maintained approximately 79.0% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift
investments. BankAtlantic had also satisfied the QTL test in each of the nine months prior to
December&nbsp;2008 and, therefore, was a QTL.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Capital Requirements</I>. The OTS regulations require savings banks to meet three minimum capital

requirement, a savings bank must compute its risk-based assets by multiplying its assets and
certain off-balance sheet items by risk-weights assigned by the OTS capital regulations. The OTS
monitors the risk management of individual institutions. The OTS may impose an individual minimum
capital requirement on institutions that it believes exhibit a higher degree of risk.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There currently are no regulatory capital requirements directly applicable to us as a unitary
savings and loan holding company apart from the regulatory capital requirements for savings banks
that are applicable to BankAtlantic; however, changes in regulations could result in additional
requirements being imposed on us.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Limitation on Capital Distributions</I>. The OTS regulations impose limitations upon certain
capital distributions by savings banks, such as certain cash dividends, payments to repurchase or
otherwise acquire its shares, payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash-out merger
and other distributions charged against capital.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OTS regulates all capital distributions by BankAtlantic directly or indirectly to us,
including dividend payments. BankAtlantic currently must file an application to receive the
approval of the OTS for a proposed capital distribution as the total amount of all of
BankAtlantic&#146;s capital distributions (including any proposed capital distribution) for the
applicable calendar year exceeds BankAtlantic&#146;s net income for that year-to-date period plus
BankAtlantic&#146;s retained net income for the preceding two years.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic may not pay dividends to the Company if, after paying those dividends, it would
fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk-based capital guidelines and the minimum
leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements, or in the event the OTS notified BankAtlantic
that it was in need of more than normal supervision. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or
FDIA, an insured depository institution such as BankAtlantic is prohibited from making capital
distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the
institution would become &#147;undercapitalized.&#148; Payment of dividends by BankAtlantic also may be
restricted at any time at the discretion of the appropriate regulator if it deems the payment to

Regulation&nbsp;W of the Federal Reserve Board, or FRB, implementing Sections&nbsp;23A and 23B of the FRA,
and by OTS regulations. The applicable OTS regulations for savings banks regarding transactions
with affiliates generally conform to the requirements of Regulation&nbsp;W, which is applicable to
national banks. In general, an affiliate of a savings bank is any company that controls, is
controlled by, or is under common control with, the savings bank, other than the savings bank&#146;s
subsidiaries. For instance, we are deemed an affiliate of BankAtlantic under these regulations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections&nbsp;22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA, Regulation&nbsp;O of the FRB, Section&nbsp;402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and OTS regulations impose limitations on loans and extensions of
credit from BankAtlantic and us to its and our executive officers, directors, controlling
shareholders and their related interests. The applicable OTS regulations for savings banks
regarding loans by a savings bank to its executive officers, directors and principal shareholders
generally conform to the requirements of Regulation&nbsp;O, which is applicable to national banks.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Enforcement</I>. Under the FDIA, the OTS has primary enforcement responsibility over savings
banks and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all &#147;institution-affiliated
parties,&#148; including any controlling stockholder or any shareholder, attorney, appraiser and
accountant who knowingly or recklessly participates in any violation of applicable law or
regulation, breach of fiduciary duty, or certain other wrongful actions that have, or are likely to
have, a significant adverse effect on an insured savings bank or cause it more than minimal loss.
In addition, the FDIC has back-up authority to take enforcement action for unsafe and unsound
practices. Formal enforcement action can include the issuance of a capital directive, cease and
desist order, removal of officers and/or directors, institution of proceedings for receivership or
conservatorship and termination of deposit insurance.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Examination</I>. A savings institution must demonstrate to the OTS its ability to manage its
compliance responsibilities by establishing an effective and comprehensive oversight and monitoring
program. The degree of compliance oversight and monitoring by the institution&#146;s management
determines the scope and intensity of the OTS&#146; examinations of the institution. Institutions with
significant management oversight and monitoring of compliance will receive less intrusive OTS
examinations than institutions with less oversight.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Standards for Safety and Soundness</I>. Pursuant to the requirements of the FDIA, the OTS,
together with the other federal bank regulatory agencies, has adopted the Interagency Guidelines
Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness, or the Guidelines. The Guidelines establish
general safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls, information and internal
audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset
quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the Guidelines require, among
other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures
specified in the Guidelines. If the OTS determines that a savings bank fails to meet any standard
established by the Guidelines, then the OTS may require the savings bank to submit to the OTS an
acceptable plan to achieve compliance. If a savings bank fails to comply, the OTS may seek an
enforcement order in judicial proceedings and impose civil monetary penalties.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shared National Credit Program</I>. The Shared National Credit Program is an interagency program,
established in 1977, to provide a periodic credit risk assessment of the largest and most complex
syndicated loans held or agented by financial institutions subject to supervision by a federal bank
regulatory agency. The Shared National Credit Program is administered by the FRB, FDIC, OTS and
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Shared National Credit Program covers any loan
or loan commitment of at least $20&nbsp;million (i)&nbsp;which is shared under a formal lending agreement by
three or more unaffiliated financial institutions or (ii)&nbsp;a portion of which is sold to two or more
unaffiliated financial institutions with the purchasing financial institutions assuming their pro
rata share of the credit risk. The Shared National Credit Program is designed to provide
uniformity and efficiency in the federal banking agencies&#146; analysis and rating of the largest and
most complex credit facilities in the country by avoiding duplicate credit reviews and ensuring
consistency in rating determinations. The federal banking agencies use a combination of
statistical and judgmental sampling techniques to select borrowers for review each year. The
selected borrowers are reviewed and the credit quality rating assigned by the applicable federal
banking agency&#146;s examination team will be reported to each financial institution that participates

other financial institutions to avoid duplicate reviews and ensure consistent treatment of these

acquired participations in the loans of other financial institutions which are subject to this

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Real Estate Lending Standards</I>. The OTS and the other federal banking agencies adopted
regulations to prescribe standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens on or
interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing the construction of improvements
on real estate. The OTS regulations require each savings bank to establish and maintain written
internal real estate lending standards that are consistent with OTS guidelines and with safe and
sound banking practices and which are appropriate to the size of the savings bank and the nature
and scope of its real estate lending activities.

OTS is required to take certain, and is authorized to take other, supervisory actions against
undercapitalized savings banks, such as requiring compliance with a capital restoration plan,
restricting asset growth, acquisitions, branching and new lines of business and, in extreme cases,
appointment of a receiver or conservator. The severity of the action required or authorized to be
taken increases as a savings bank&#146;s capital deteriorates. Savings banks are classified into five
categories of capitalization as &#147;well capitalized,&#148; &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; &#147;undercapitalized,&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Insurance of Deposit Accounts</I>. Savings banks are subject to a risk-based assessment system
for determining the deposit insurance assessments to be paid by them.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until December&nbsp;31, 2006, the FDIC had assigned each savings institution to one of three
capital categories based on the savings institution&#146;s financial information as of its most recent
quarterly financial report filed with the applicable bank regulatory agency prior to the assessment
period. The FDIC had also assigned each savings institution to one of three supervisory
subcategories within each capital category based upon a supervisory evaluation provided to the FDIC
by the savings institution&#146;s primary federal regulator and information that the FDIC determined to
be relevant to the savings institution&#146;s financial condition and the risk posed to the previously
existing deposit insurance funds. A savings institution&#146;s deposit insurance assessment rate
depended on the capital category and supervisory subcategory to which it was assigned. Insurance
assessment rates ranged from 0.00% of deposits for a savings institution in the highest category
(i.e., well capitalized and financially sound, with no more than a few minor weaknesses) to 0.27%
of deposits for a savings institution in the lowest category (i.e., undercapitalized and
substantial supervisory concern).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;1, 2007, the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005, or the Reform Act,
became effective. The Reform Act, among other things, merged the Bank Insurance Fund and the
Savings Association Insurance Fund, both of which were administered by the FDIC, into a new fund
administered by the FDIC known as the Deposit Insurance Fund, or DIF, and increased the coverage
limit for certain retirement plan deposits to $250,000, but maintained the basic insurance coverage
limit of $100,000 for other depositors. On October&nbsp;3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act of 2008, or the Stabilization Act, temporarily raised the basic insurance coverage limit to
$250,000. The Stabilization Act provides that the basic insurance limit will return to $100,000
after December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Reform Act, the FDIC now assigns each savings institution to one of four
risk categories based upon the savings institution&#146;s capital evaluation and supervisory evaluation.
The capital evaluation is based upon financial information as of the savings institution&#146;s most
recent quarterly financial report filed with the applicable bank regulatory agency at the end of
each quarterly assessment period. The supervisory evaluation is based upon the results of
examination findings by the savings institution&#146;s primary federal regulator and information that
the FDIC has determined to be relevant to the savings institution&#146;s financial condition and the
risk posed to the DIF. A savings institution&#146;s deposit insurance assessment rate depends on the
risk category to which it is assigned. For the quarter which began January&nbsp;1, 2009, insurance
assessment rates range from 12 cents per $100 in assessable deposits for a savings institution in
the least risk category (i.e., well capitalized and financially sound with only a few minor
weaknesses) to 50 cents per $100 in assessable deposits for a savings institution in the most risk
category
(i.e., undercapitalized and poses a substantial probability of loss to the DIF unless effective
corrective action is taken).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIC is authorized to raise the assessment rates in certain circumstances, which would
affect savings institutions in all risk categories. The FDIC has exercised this authority several
times in the past and could raise rates in the future. The FDIC has proposed to adjust, and in
certain instances increase, insurance assessment rates for quarters beginning on or after April&nbsp;1,
2009 as well as impose a special assessment payable September&nbsp;30, 2009. While the special
assessment is under continued discussion, increases in deposit insurance premiums would have an
adverse effect on our earnings.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Privacy and Security Protection</I>. BankAtlantic is subject to the OTS regulations implementing
the privacy and security protection provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA. These
regulations require a savings bank to disclose to its customers and consumers its policy and
practices with respect to the privacy, and sharing with nonaffiliated third parties, of its
customers and consumers&#146; &#147;nonpublic personal information.&#148; Additionally, in certain instances,
BankAtlantic is required to provide its customers and consumers with the ability to &#147;opt-out&#148; of
having BankAtlantic share their nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties.
These regulations also require savings banks to maintain policies and procedures to safeguard their
customers and consumers&#146; nonpublic personal information. BankAtlantic has policies and procedures
designed to comply with GLBA and applicable privacy and security regulations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Insurance Activities</I>. BankAtlantic is generally permitted to engage in certain insurance
activities through its subsidiaries. The OTS regulations implemented pursuant to GLBA prohibit,
among other things, depository institutions from conditioning the extension of credit to
individuals upon either the purchase of an insurance product or annuity or an agreement by the
consumer not to purchase an insurance product or annuity from an entity that is not affiliated with
the depository institution. The regulations also require prior disclosure of this prohibition to
potential insurance product or annuity customers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Federal Home Loan Bank System</I>. BankAtlantic is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Atlanta, which is one of the twelve regional FHLB&#146;s composing the FHLB system. Each FHLB provides
a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions as well as other entities involved
in home mortgage lending. Any advances from a FHLB must be secured by specified types of
collateral, and all long-term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for
residential housing finance. As a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, BankAtlantic is required to
acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB of Atlanta. BankAtlantic was in compliance
with this requirement with an investment in FHLB of Atlanta stock at December&nbsp;31, 2008 of
approximately $55&nbsp;million. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the FHLB of Atlanta paid
dividends of approximately $2.8&nbsp;million on the capital stock held by BankAtlantic. If dividends
were reduced or interest on future FHLB advances increased, BankAtlantic&#146;s net interest income
would likely also be reduced. The FHLB did not pay a dividend during the fourth quarter of 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Federal Reserve System</I>. BankAtlantic is subject to provisions of the FRA and the FRB&#146;s
regulations, pursuant to which depository institutions may be required to maintain
non-interest-earning reserves against their deposit accounts and certain other liabilities.
Currently, federal savings banks must maintain reserves against transaction accounts (primarily NOW
and regular interest and non-interest bearing checking accounts). The FRB regulations establish
the specific rates of reserves that must be maintained, which are subject to adjustment by the FRB.
BankAtlantic is currently in compliance with those reserve requirements. The required reserves
must be maintained in the form of vault cash, a non-interest-bearing account at a Federal Reserve
Bank, or a pass-through account as defined by the FRB. The effect of this reserve requirement is
to reduce interest-earning assets. FHLB system members are also authorized to borrow from the
Federal Reserve &#147;discount window,&#148; but FRB regulations require such institutions to exhaust all
FHLB sources before borrowing from a Federal Reserve Bank.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Anti-Terrorism and Anti-Money Laundering Regulations</I>. The Uniting and Strengthening America
by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA
PATRIOT Act, provides the federal government with additional powers to address terrorist threats
through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information
sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy
Act, or BSA, the USA PATRIOT Act puts in place measures intended to encourage information sharing
among bank regulatory and law enforcement agencies. In addition, certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act impose affirmative obligations on a broad range
of financial institutions, including savings banks.

identification program, or CIP, as part of its anti-money laundering program. The key components
of the CIP are identification, verification, government list comparison, notice and record
retention. The purpose of the CIP is to enable the financial institution to determine the true
identity and anticipated account activity of each customer. To make this determination, among
other things, the financial institution must collect certain information from customers at the
time they enter into the customer relationship with the financial institution. This information
must be verified within a reasonable time through documentary and non-documentary methods.
Furthermore, all customers must be screened against any CIP-related government lists of known or
suspected terrorists.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge Holdings Corporation (&#147;Woodbridge,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) (formerly
Levitt Corporation), directly and through its wholly owned subsidiaries, historically has been a
real estate development company with activities in the Southeastern United States. We were
organized in December&nbsp;1982 under the laws of the State of Florida. Historically, our operations
were primarily within the real estate industry; however, our current business strategy includes the
pursuit of investments and acquisitions within or outside of the real estate industry, as well as
the continued development of master-planned communities. Under this business model, we likely will
not generate a consistent earnings stream and the composition of our revenues may vary widely due
to factors inherent in a particular investment, including the maturity and cyclical nature of, and
market conditions relating to, the business invested in. Net investment gains and other income
will be based primarily on the success of our investments as well as overall market conditions.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008, Woodbridge engaged in business activities through the Land Division, consisting of
the operations of Core Communities, LLC (&#147;Core Communities&#148; or &#147;Core&#148;), which develops
master-planned communities, and through the Other Operations segment (&#147;Other Operations&#148;), which
includes the parent company operations of Woodbridge (the &#147;Parent Company&#148;), the consolidated
operations of Pizza Fusion Holdings, Inc. (&#147;Pizza Fusion&#148;), the consolidated operations of Carolina
Oak Homes, LLC (&#147;Carolina Oak&#148;), which engaged in homebuilding in South Carolina prior to the
suspension of those activities during the fourth quarter of 2008, and other activities through
Cypress Creek Capital Holdings, LLC (&#147;Cypress Creek Capital&#148;) and Snapper Creek Equity Management,
LLC (&#147;Snapper Creek&#148;). An equity investment in Bluegreen Corporation (&#147;Bluegreen&#148;) and an
investment in Office Depot, Inc. (&#147;Office Depot&#148;) are also included in the Other Operations
segment.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until November&nbsp;9, 2007, the Company also engaged in homebuilding activities through Levitt and
Sons, LLC (&#147;Levitt and Sons&#148;) and reported results of operations through two additional reporting
segments, Primary Homebuilding and Tennessee Homebuilding. On November&nbsp;9, 2007, Levitt and Sons
filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition and, accordingly, the Company deconsolidated Levitt and Sons
as of that date. As a result of the deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons, the results of operations
of the Primary Homebuilding segment, with the exception of Carolina Oak, and Tennessee Homebuilding
segments were only included as separate segments through November&nbsp;9, 2007, the date of Woodbridge&#146;s
deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons (see Note 24 to our audited consolidated financial statements
included in Item&nbsp;8 for financial information of Levitt and Sons). The presentation and allocation
of the assets, liabilities and results of operations of each segment may not reflect the actual
economic costs of the segment as a stand-alone business. If a different basis of allocation were
utilized, the relative contributions of the segment might differ but, in management&#146;s view, the
relative trends in segments would not likely be impacted. See Item&nbsp;7. &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; and (Note 21) to our audited
consolidated financial statements contained under Item&nbsp;8. &#147;Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data&#148; for a discussion of trends, results of operations, and other relevant information on each
segment.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core Communities was founded in May&nbsp;1996 to develop a master-planned community in Port St.
Lucie, Florida now known as St. Lucie West. Historically, its activities focused on the development
of a master-planned community in Port St. Lucie, Florida called Tradition, Florida and a community
outside of Hardeeville, South Carolina called Tradition Hilton Head. Tradition, Florida has been
in active development for several years, while Tradition Hilton Head is in the early stage of
development. As a master-planned community developer, Core Communities engages in four primary
activities: (i)&nbsp;the acquisition of large tracts of raw land; (ii)&nbsp;planning, entitlement and
infrastructure development; (iii)&nbsp;the sale of entitled land and/or developed lots to homebuilders
and commercial, industrial and institutional end-users; and (iv)&nbsp;the development and leasing of
commercial space to commercial, industrial and institutional end-users.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Lucie West is a 4,600 acre master-planned community located in St. Lucie County, Florida.
It is bordered by Interstate 95 to the west and Florida&#146;s Turnpike to the east. The community
blends residential, commercial and industrial developments where residents have access to commerce,
recreation, entertainment, religious, and educational facilities all within the community. St.
Lucie West is completely sold out and substantially built out. There are more than 6,000 homes in
St. Lucie West housing nearly 15,000 residents.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tradition, Florida encompasses more than 8,200 total acres and is planned to include a
4.5-mile long employment corridor along I-95, educational and health care facilities, commercial
properties, residential developments and other uses in a series of mixed-use parcels. As part of
the employment corridor, a 120-acre research park is being marketed as the Florida Center for
Innovation at Tradition (&#147;FCI&#148;), within which the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies
(TPIMS)&nbsp;has built its new headquarters. FCI is planned to consist of just under two million
square feet of research and development space, a 300 bed Martin Memorial Health Systems hospital, a
27-acre lake with a 1-mile fitness trail and recreational amenities, state-of-the-art fiber optic
cabling, underground electrical power and proximity to high-quality housing, restaurants, hotels
and shopping. Mann Research Center also purchased a 22.4 acre parcel within the FCI on which it
intends to build a 400,000-square-foot life sciences complex. Oregon Health &#038; Science
University&#146;s Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute also announced plans to locate a
120,000-square-foot facility within FCI. Special assessment bonds are being utilized to provide
financing for certain infrastructure developments.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tradition Hilton Head encompasses almost 5,400 total acres and is currently entitled for up to
9,500 residential units and 1.5&nbsp;million square feet of commercial space, in addition to
recreational areas, educational facilities and emergency services.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Land Division recorded $11.3&nbsp;million in sales in 2008 compared to $16.6&nbsp;million in 2007 as
demand for residential and commercial inventory in Florida remained slow. The overall slowdown in
the real estate markets and disruptions in credit markets continue to have a negative effect on
demand for residential land in our Land Division which historically was partially mitigated by
increased commercial leasing revenue. Traffic at the Tradition, Florida information center remains
slow, reflecting the overall state of the Florida real estate market. In response to these market
conditions, the Land Division has concentrated on commercial property. In addition to sales of
parcels to developers, the Land Division plans to continue to internally develop certain projects
for leasing to third parties subject to market demand. Core generated higher revenues in 2008
compared to 2007 due to increased rental income associated with the leasing of certain commercial
properties and increased revenues relating to irrigation services provided to homebuilders,
commercial users, and the residents of Tradition, Florida. Retailers at Tradition, Florida
include nationally branded retail stores such as Target, Babies R Us, Bed, Bath and Beyond, Office
Max, The Sports Authority, TJ Maxx, Petsmart, LA Fitness and Old Navy.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Operations consist of the operations of our Parent Company, Carolina Oak, and Pizza
Fusion, other activities through Cypress Creek Capital and Snapper Creek, our equity investment in
Bluegreen and an investment in Office Depot.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Investment in Bluegreen Corporation</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We own approximately 9.5&nbsp;million shares of the outstanding common stock of Bluegreen, which
represents approximately 31% of that company&#146;s issued and outstanding common stock. Bluegreen is a
leading provider of vacation and residential lifestyle choices through its resorts and residential
community businesses. Bluegreen is organized into two divisions: Bluegreen Resorts and Bluegreen
Communities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen Resorts acquires, develops and markets vacation ownership interests (&#147;VOIs&#148;) in
resorts generally located in popular high-volume, &#147;drive-to&#148; vacation destinations. Bluegreen
Communities acquires, develops and subdivides property and markets residential land homesites, the
majority of which are sold directly to retail customers who seek to build a home in a high quality
residential setting, in some cases on properties featuring a golf course and related amenities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen also generates significant interest income through its financing of individual
purchasers of VOIs and, to a nominal extent, homesites sold by its Bluegreen Communities division.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, we began evaluating our investment in Bluegreen for other-than-temporary
impairment in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) Staff Position (&#147;FSP&#148;)
FAS 115-1/FAS 124-1, <I>&#147;The Meaning of Other-than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments&#148; </I>(&#147;FSP FAS 115-1/FAS 124-1&#148;), Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;18, <I>&#147;The Equity
Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock&#148;</I>, (&#147;APB No.&nbsp;18&#148;) and Securities and Exchange
Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;59 (&#147;SAB No.&nbsp;59&#148;) as the fair value of the
Bluegreen stock had fallen below the carrying value of our investment in Bluegreen of approximately
$12 per share. We analyzed various quantitative and qualitative factors including our intent and
ability to hold the investment, the severity and duration of the impairment and the prospects for
the improvement of fair value. On July&nbsp;21, 2008, Bluegreen&#146;s Board of Directors entered into a
non-binding letter of intent for the sale of Bluegreen&#146;s outstanding common stock for $15 per share
to a third party, with a due diligence and exclusivity period through September&nbsp;15, 2008. This due
diligence and exclusivity period was subsequently extended through November&nbsp;15, 2008. In October
2008, Bluegreen disclosed that the third party buyer had been unable to obtain the financing
necessary to execute a sale transaction, therefore, no assurances could be provided that a sale
would be completed. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the exclusivity period had expired and Bluegreen was
not able to consummate a sale.

<DIV align="right" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Real Estate Development<br>(Woodbridge)</div>






<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At September&nbsp;30, 2008, our investment in Bluegreen was $119.4&nbsp;million compared to the $65.8
million trading value (calculated based upon the $6.91 closing price of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock on
the New York Stock Exchange on September&nbsp;30, 2008). We determined that our investment in Bluegreen
was other-than-temporarily impaired due to the severity of the decline in the fair value of the
investment, the probability that a sale could not be executed by Bluegreen, and due to the
deterioration of the debt and equity markets in the third quarter of 2008. Therefore, we recorded
an impairment charge of $53.6&nbsp;million, adjusting the carrying value of our investment in Bluegreen
to $65.8&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2008. Additionally, after further evaluation of our investment in
Bluegreen as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, based on, among other things, the continued decline of
Bluegreen&#146;s common stock price and the continued deterioration of the equity markets, we determined
that an additional impairment of the investment in Bluegreen was appropriate. Accordingly, we
recorded a $40.8&nbsp;million impairment charge (calculated based upon the $3.13 closing price of
Bluegreen&#146;s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on December&nbsp;31, 2008) and adjusted the
carrying value of our investment in Bluegreen to $29.8&nbsp;million. On March&nbsp;13, 2009, the closing
price of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock was $1.12 per share.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen has announced that it is implementing strategic initiatives in order to conserve
cash that will significantly reduce sales, eliminate certain marketing programs, and reduce capital
spending and overhead by eliminating a significant number of employees, among other things. During
the fourth quarter of 2008, Bluegreen recorded $15.6&nbsp;million in restructuring charges in connection
with the implementation of these initiatives and recorded an $8.5&nbsp;million impairment charge related
to its goodwill.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Investment in Office Depot</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During March&nbsp;2008, we, together with Woodbridge Equity Fund LLLP, a newly formed limited
liability limited partnership wholly-owned by us, purchased 3,000,200 shares of Office Depot common
stock, which represented approximately one percent of Office Depot&#146;s outstanding stock. These
Office Depot shares were acquired at an average price of $11.33 per share for an aggregate purchase
price of approximately $34.0&nbsp;million. During June&nbsp;2008, we sold 1,565,200 shares of Office Depot
common stock at an average price of $12.08 per share for an aggregate sales price of approximately
$18.9&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During December&nbsp;2008, we performed an impairment analysis of our remaining investment in
Office Depot common stock in accordance with FSP FAS 115-1/FAS 124-1. As result of the impairment
analysis, we concluded that based on deteriorating economic conditions which could negatively
impact the future earning potential of Office Depot, the continued decline of the Office Depot
stock price, the continued decline in the overall economy and credit markets and the
unpredictability of the recovery of the Office Depot stock price, there was an other-than-temporary
impairment associated with our investment in Office Depot. As a result, we recorded an
other-than-temporary impairment charge of approximately $12.0&nbsp;million representing the difference
of the average cost value of $11.33 per share and the fair value of $2.98 per share as of December
31, 2008, which represented our new basis in this investment. On March&nbsp;13, 2009, the closing price
of Office Depot&#146;s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $1.10 per share.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Acquisition of Pizza Fusion</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pizza Fusion is a restaurant franchise operating in a niche market within the quick service
and organic food industries. Founded in 2006, Pizza Fusion was operating 16 locations in Florida
and California through December&nbsp;31, 2008 and entered into franchise agreements to open an
additional 14 stores over 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;18, 2008, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Woodbridge Equity Fund II LP, purchased
for an aggregate of $3.0&nbsp;million 2,608,696 shares of Series&nbsp;B Convertible Preferred Stock of Pizza
Fusion, together with warrants to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 shares of Series&nbsp;B
Convertible Preferred Stock of Pizza Fusion at an exercise price of $1.44 per share. We also have
options, exercisable on or prior to September&nbsp;18, 2009, to purchase up to 521,740 additional shares
of Series&nbsp;B Convertible Preferred Stock of Pizza Fusion at a price of $1.15 per share and, upon
exercise of such options, will receive warrants to purchase up to 300,000 additional shares of
Series&nbsp;B Convertible Preferred Stock of Pizza Fusion at an exercise price of $1.44 per share. The
warrants have a 10&nbsp;year term and are subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances.

&#147;<I>Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities</I>&#148; (&#147;FIN No.&nbsp;46(R)&#148;), and determined that Pizza Fusion

beneficiary and as such, consolidated the financial statements of Pizza Fusion as of September&nbsp;18,
2008. We will continue to review our primary beneficiary status for any potential changes in
ownership or capital structure that may cause us to reconsider whether we should continue to
consolidate the financial statements of Pizza Fusion. The financial statements of Pizza Fusion at
December&nbsp;31, 2008 were not material. See (Note 3) to our audited consolidated financial statements

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2007, we acquired from Levitt and Sons all of the outstanding membership interests in
Carolina Oak, a South Carolina limited liability company (formerly known as Levitt and Sons of
Jasper County, LLC), for the following consideration: (i)&nbsp;assumption of the outstanding principal
balance of a loan in the amount of $34.1&nbsp;million which is collateralized by a 150 acre parcel of
land owned by Carolina Oak located in Tradition Hilton Head, (ii)&nbsp;execution of a promissory note in
the amount of $400,000 to serve as a deposit under a purchase agreement between Carolina Oak and
Core Communities of South Carolina, LLC and (iii)&nbsp;the assumption of specified payables in the
amount of approximately $5.3&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2008, as a result of, among other things, a further deterioration
in consumer confidence, an overall softening of demand for new homes, a decline in the overall
economy, increasing unemployment, a deterioration in the credit markets, and the direct and
indirect impact of the turmoil in the mortgage loan market, we made a decision to suspend Carolina
Oak&#146;s homebuilding activities until the residential housing market improves. Consequently, the
purchase agreement between Carolina Oak and Core Communities of South Carolina was canceled and the
$400,000 deposit was forfeited. Carolina Oak sold and delivered 8 units during 2008 and, as of
December&nbsp;31, 2008, had 6 completed unsold units. Carolina Oak has an additional 91 lots that are
ready and available for home construction. The community was originally planned to consist of
approximately 403 additional units. However, there can be no assurance as to when homebuilding
activities in this community will be resumed.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2008, we reviewed Carolina Oak project&#146;s inventory of real estate for
impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;144,
<I>&#147;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;144&#148;). The estimated
fair market value of the project was determined based on an appraisal performed by an independent
third party. The independent appraisal considered, among other things, general economic
conditions, competition in the market where the community is located, alternative product offerings
that may impact sales price, the number of homes that can be built on the site, and alternative
uses for the property such as the possibility of a sale of the entire community to another builder
or the sale of individual home sites. We assessed the fair value of the project based on the
appraisal performed by a third party because we believe an independent appraisal is the best
estimate in determining fair value under the current circumstances. As a result of the analysis,
we recorded an impairment charge of $3.5&nbsp;million in cost of sales for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2008, which is reflected in the Other Operations segment.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously reported, the results of operations and financial condition of Carolina Oak as
of and for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006 were included in the Primary Homebuilding
segment because its financial metrics were similar in nature to the other homebuilding projects
within that segment. However, due to our acquisition of Carolina Oak and the deconsolidation of
Levitt and Sons, which comprised our Primary and Tennessee Homebuilding segments, as of November&nbsp;9,
2007, the results of operations and financial condition of Carolina Oak as of and for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 are included in the Other Operations segment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We entered into an indemnity agreement in April&nbsp;2004 with a joint venture partner at Altman
Longleaf relating to, among other obligations, that partner&#146;s guarantee of the joint venture&#146;s
indebtedness. Our liability under the indemnity agreement was limited to the amount of any
distributions from the joint venture which exceeds our original capital and other contributions.
Levitt Commercial, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary (&#147;Levitt Commercial&#148;) owned a 20% interest in
Altman Longleaf, LLC, which owned a 20% interest in this joint venture. This joint venture
developed a 298-unit apartment complex in Melbourne, Florida, with construction commencing in 2004
and ending in 2006. An affiliate of our joint venture partner was the general contractor. Our
original capital contributions totaled approximately $585,000 and we have received approximately
$1.2&nbsp;million in distributions since 2004. In December&nbsp;2008, our interest in the joint venture was
sold and we received approximately $182,000 as a result of the sale and we were released from any
potential obligation of indemnity which may have arisen in connection with the joint venture.

communities for active adults and families in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.
Levitt and Sons operated in two reportable segments, Primary Homebuilding and Tennessee
Homebuilding.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased inventory levels combined with weakened consumer demand for housing and tightened
credit requirements has negatively affected sales, deliveries and margins throughout the
homebuilding industry. In both the Primary Homebuilding and Tennessee Homebuilding segments,
Levitt and Sons experienced decreased orders, decreased margins and increased cancellation rates on
homes in backlog. Excess supply, particularly in previously strong markets like Florida, in
combination with a reduction in demand resulting from tightened credit requirements and reductions
in credit availability, as well as buyers&#146; fears about the direction of the market, exerted a
continuous cycle of downward pricing pressure for residential homes.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;9, 2007 (the &#147;Petition Date&#148;), Levitt and Sons and substantially all of its
subsidiaries (collectively, the &#147;Debtors&#148;) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter&nbsp;11 of
Title 11 of the United States Code (the &#147;Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases&#148;) in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the Southern District of Florida ( the&#147;Bankruptcy Court&#148;). The Debtors commenced the Chapter&nbsp;11
Cases in order to preserve the value of their assets and to facilitate an orderly wind-down of
their businesses and disposition of their assets in a manner intended to maximize the recoveries of
all constituents. See Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; for the current status of the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the filing of the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases, we deconsolidated Levitt and Sons as of

income. As of November&nbsp;9, 2007, Woodbridge had a negative investment in Levitt and Sons of $123.0
million and there were outstanding advances due from Levitt and Sons of $67.8&nbsp;million at Woodbridge
resulting in a net negative investment of $55.2&nbsp;million. Included in the negative investment was
approximately $15.8&nbsp;million associated with deferred revenue related to intra-segment sales between
Levitt and Sons and Core Communities. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company identified
approximately $2.3&nbsp;million of deferred revenue on intercompany sales between Core and Carolina Oak
that had been misclassified against the negative investment in Levitt and Sons. As a result, the
Company recorded a $2.3&nbsp;million reclassification between inventory of real estate and the loss in
excess of investment in subsidiary in the consolidated statements of financial condition. As a

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;20, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court presiding over Levitt and Sons&#146; Chapter&nbsp;11
bankruptcy case entered an order confirming a plan of liquidation jointly proposed by Levitt and
Sons and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. That order also approved the settlement
pursuant to the settlement agreement we entered into on June&nbsp;27, 2008 (See Item&nbsp;3 &#147;Legal
Proceedings&#148;). No appeal or rehearing of the court&#146;s order was timely filed by any party, and the
settlement was consummated on March&nbsp;3, 2009, at which time, payment was made in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the settlement agreement. The cost of settlement and reversal of the
related $52.9&nbsp;million liability will be recognized into income in the first quarter of 2009. See
Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; for further discussion of the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Executive Compensation Program</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;29, 2008, our Board of Directors approved the terms of incentive programs for
certain of our employees including certain of our named executive officers, pursuant to which a
portion of their compensation will be based on the cash returns realized by us on our investments.
The programs relate to the performance of existing investments and new investments designated by
the Board (together, the &#147;Investments&#148;). All of our investments have been or will be held by
individual limited partnerships or other legal entities established for such purpose. Participating
executives and employees will have interests in the entities, which will be the basis of their
incentives under the programs. Our named executive officers may have interests tied both to the
performance of a particular investment as well as interests relating to the performance of the
portfolio of investments as a whole.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge, in its capacity as investor in the investment program, will be entitled to receive
a return of its invested capital and a specified rate of return on its invested capital prior to
our executive officers or employees being entitled to receive any portion of the realized profits
(the share to which they may be entitled is referred to as the &#147;Carried Interest&#148;). For existing
investments, the amount of invested capital was determined as of September&nbsp;1, 2008, by our Board of
Directors. Once we receive our priority return of our invested capital and the stated return (which
accrues from September&nbsp;1, 2008), we will also generally be entitled to additional amounts that
provide it with (i)&nbsp;at least approximately 87% of the aggregate proceeds related to our status as
an investor in excess of our invested capital in that investment, plus (ii)&nbsp;at least 35% of all
other amounts earned from third parties with respect to that investment (i.e., income not related
to our status as an investor, such as management fees charged to third parties). The remaining
proceeds will be available under the incentive programs for distribution among those employees
directly responsible for the relevant Investments and our executive officers. The compensation
committee of our Board of Directors will determine the allocations to our named executive
officers. These

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">allocations are identified in advance for each of the executive officers. Although the
compensation committee can alter these allocations on a prospective basis, the total amount payable
to employees and officers cannot be changed. Management will determine the amounts to be allocated
among the other employee participants. The incentive programs relating to both individual
investments and the program established for the executive officers with respect to the overall
performance of the portfolio of investments contain clawback obligations that are intended to
reduce the risk that the participants will be distributed amounts under the programs prior to our
receipt of at least a return of our invested capital and the stated return. To the extent that
named executive officers participate in the performance of a particular investment, their clawback
obligations nevertheless refer to the performance of the portfolio as a whole. The programs
contemplate that the clawback obligations will be funded solely from holdback accounts established
with respect to each participant. Amounts equal to a portion of Carried Interest distribution to
such participant (initially 25% and which can be increased, when appropriate, to as high as 75%)
will be deposited into holdback accounts or otherwise made available for our benefit. There are
also general vesting and forfeiture provisions applicable to each participant&#146;s right to receive
any Carried Interest, the terms of which may vary by individual. Our Board of Directors believes
that the above-described incentive plans appropriately align payments to participants with the
performance of our Investments.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2007, Core Communities began soliciting bids from several potential buyers to purchase
assets associated with two of Core&#146;s commercial leasing projects (the &#147;Projects&#148;). As the criteria
for assets held for sale had been met in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144, the assets were reclassified
to assets held for sale and the liabilities related to those assets were reclassified to
liabilities related to assets held for sale in prior periods. The results of operations for these
assets were reclassified as discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2007 and we ceased
recording depreciation expense on these Projects. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined
that given the difficulty in predicting the timing or probability of a sale of these assets
associated with the Projects as a result of, among other things, the economic downturn and
disruptions in credit markets, the requirements of SFAS No.&nbsp;144 necessary to classify these assets
held for sale and to be included in discontinued operations were no longer met and management could
not assert the Projects can be sold within a year. Therefore, the results of operations for these
Projects were reclassified for the three years ending December&nbsp;31, 2008 back into continuing
operations in the consolidated statements of operations. In accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144, we
recorded a depreciation recapture of $3.2&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008 to account for the
depreciation not recorded while the assets were classified as discontinued operations. Total assets
and liabilities related to the Projects were $92.7&nbsp;million and $76.1&nbsp;million, respectively, for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, and $96.2&nbsp;million and 80.1&nbsp;million, respectively, for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007. In addition, total revenues related to the Projects for the years ended December
31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $8.7&nbsp;million, $4.7&nbsp;million and $1.8&nbsp;million, respectively, while
income (loss)&nbsp;related to the assets for the same periods in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $6.0&nbsp;million,
$1.8&nbsp;million and $(21,000), respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U><B>Business Strategy</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business strategy involves the following principal goals:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Continue to develop master-planned communities</I>. While The Land Division&#146;s strategy has
generally been focused on the development of its master-planned communities in Florida and South
Carolina, current economic conditions have required that development activities be reduced to a
minimum. As supply and demand for both commercial and residential development approach a more
reasonable balance, Core will further evaluate its position to determine when it may be
economically feasible to once again initiate more expansive development activities than currently
exist. Nevertheless, Core continues to market parcels to homebuilders, and the Land Division
continues to focus on its commercial operations through sales to developers and through its efforts
to internally develop projects for leasing to third parties. A major component of Core&#146;s long term
strategy is the development of communities that will responsibly serve its residents and
businesses. The overall goal of its developments is to facilitate a regional roadway network and
establish model communities that will set an example for future development. Core has established a
series of community design standards which have been incorporated into the overall planning effort
of master-planned communities including: utilizing a mix of housing types, including single-family
neighborhoods and a variety of higher density communities; and having a neighborhood Town Center,
Community School parcels, a workplace environment and community parks. The intent is to establish
well-planned, innovative communities that are sustainable for the long-term.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We view our commercial projects opportunistically and intend to periodically evaluate the
short and long term benefits of retention or disposition. Margins on land sales and the many
factors which impact the margin have and may continue to fall below historical levels given the
current downturn in the real estate markets. Recent trends in home sales may require us to
continue to hold our land inventory longer than originally projected. We intend to review each
parcel ready for development to determine whether to market the parcel to third parties, to
internally develop the parcel for leasing, or hold the parcel and determine later whether to pursue
third party sales or internal development opportunities. Our decision will be based, in part, on
the condition of the commercial real estate market and our evaluation of future prospects. Our
land development activities in our master-planned communities offer a source of land for future
homebuilding by others. Much of our master-planned community acreage is under varying development
orders and is not immediately available for construction or sale to third parties at prices that
maximize value. Third-party homebuilder sales remain an important part of our ongoing strategy to
generate cash flow, maximize returns and diversify risk, as well as to create appropriate housing
alternatives for different market segments in our master-planned communities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Operate efficiently and effectively</I>. We raised a significant amount of capital in 2007
through a rights offering and have implemented significant reductions in workforce levels. We
intend to continue our focus on aligning our staffing levels with business goals and current and
anticipated future market conditions. We also intend to continue to focus on expense management
initiatives throughout the organization.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Pursue investment opportunities. </I>We intend to pursue acquisitions and investments, using a
combination of our cash and stock and third party equity and debt financing. These investments may
be within or outside of the real estate industry and may also include investments with affiliated
entities. We also intend to explore a variety of funding structures which might leverage or
capitalize on our available cash and other assets currently owned by us. We may acquire entire
businesses, or majority or minority, non-controlling interests in companies. Investing on this
basis will present additional risks, including the risks inherent in the industries in which we
invest and potential integration risks if we seek to integrate the acquired operations into our
operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U><B>Seasonality</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have historically experienced volatility, but not necessarily seasonality, in our results
of operations from quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of the real estate business. Historically,
land sale revenues have been sporadic and have fluctuated dramatically. In addition, margins on
land sales and the many factors which impact margins may remain below historical levels given the
current downturn in the real estate markets where we own properties. We are focusing on maximizing
our sales efforts with homebuilders at our master-planned communities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">However, due to the uncertainty in the real estate market, we expect to continue to experience
a high level of volatility in our Land Division and Other Operations segment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U><B>Competition</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real estate development industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with
third parties in our efforts to sell land to homebuilders. We compete with other local, regional
and national real estate companies and homebuilders, often within larger subdivisions designed,
planned and developed by such competitors. Some of our competitors have greater financial,
marketing, sales and other resources than we do.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are relatively low barriers to entry into the real estate market. There
are no required technologies that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering our markets.
Our competitors may independently develop land. A substantial portion of our operations are in
Florida and South Carolina, and we expect to continue to face additional competition from new
entrants into our markets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U><B>Employees</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, we employed a total of 84 individuals, of which 55 were part of our
Land Division and 29 were part of our Other Operations segment. Our employees are not represented
by any collective bargaining agreements and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe
our employee relations are satisfactory. In January&nbsp;2009, as part of our continuing efforts to
align our staffing levels with our current operations, 14 employees were terminated in our Land
Division.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>We have in the past incurred cash flow deficits that we expect will continue in the future.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC is a holding company engaged in making investments in operating businesses which has no
revenue generating operating activities. Accordingly, we have in the past incurred cash flow
deficits at the BFC parent company level and expect to continue to do so in the foreseeable future.
We incurred operating and investing cash flow deficits of $5.9&nbsp;million and $2.5&nbsp;million, respectively,
during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. We have financed these operating cash flow deficits with
available working capital. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, BFC&#146;s cash and cash equivalents balance was
approximately $9.7&nbsp;million. Since our business strategy involves primarily holding long-term
investments and neither BankAtlantic Bancorp nor Woodbridge is expected to declare dividends to its common shareholders in 2009, our
investments made are not expected to generate cash flow to BFC in the
near term. As a result, if cash flow is not sufficient to fund our operating expenses
in the future, we may be forced to reduce operating expenses, to liquidate some of our investments
or to seek to fund the expenses from the proceeds of additional equity or debt financing. There is
no assurance that any such financing would be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at
all, or that we would not be forced to liquidate our investments at depressed prices.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Adverse conditions and events where our investments are currently concentrated could continue to
adversely impact our results and future growth.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s business, the location of BankAtlantic&#146;s branches and the real estate
collateralizing its commercial real estate loans are concentrated in Florida. Further,
Woodbridge&#146;s operations are concentrated in Florida and South Carolina. Economic conditions
generally, and the economies of both Florida and South Carolina in particular have adversely
impacted the results and prospects of BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge. Further each of the
states is subject to the risks of natural disasters, such as tropical storms and hurricanes. The
continued impact of the economic downturn, natural disaster or adverse changes in laws or
regulations applicable to the companies could impact the credit quality of BankAtlantic&#146;s assets,
the desirability of Woodbridge&#146;s properties, the financial performance of Woodbridge&#146;s and
BankAtlantic&#146;s customers and the overall success of Woodbridge and BankAtlantic.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2008, we held approximately 30% of the outstanding common stock of
BankAtlantic Bancorp. Dividends by BankAtlantic Bancorp are subject to a number of conditions,

debt service obligations will depend upon adequate cash holdings, which are driven by the results
of operations, financial condition and cash requirements of BankAtlantic Bancorp, and the ability
of BankAtlantic to pay dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp. The ability of BankAtlantic to pay
dividends or make other distributions to BankAtlantic Bancorp is subject to regulations and Office
of Thrift Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;) approval and is based upon BankAtlantic&#146;s regulatory capital levels
and net income. Due to BankAtlantic&#146;s recent net losses, BankAtlantic has decided to suspend
dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp. In addition, if BankAtlantic participates in the TARP Capital
Purchase Program, its ability to pay dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp in the future will be
subject to the restrictions contained in that program. In February&nbsp;2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp
elected to exercise its right to defer payments of interest on its trust preferred junior
subordinated debt. BankAtlantic Bancorp is permitted to defer

during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2007. However, Woodbridge has not paid any dividends on its
Class&nbsp;A or Class&nbsp;B common stock since the first quarter of 2007, and the Company does not
anticipate that it will be receiving additional dividends from Woodbridge for the foreseeable
future based on current economic conditions and the conditions of the real estate market.
Woodbridge may also be limited contractually from paying dividends by the terms of its outstanding
indebtedness. Future dividends from Woodbridge are subject to approval by Woodbridge&#146;s Board of

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge are consolidated in the Company&#146;s financial
statements, the decline in the market price of their stock would not impact the Company&#146;s
consolidated financial statements. However, the continued decline in the market price of either of
these securities would likely have an effect on the market price of our common stock and the market
price of our common stock and our directly held equity securities are important to the valuation
and financing capability of BFC.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to realize or liquidate these investments will depend on future market and
economic conditions and the ability to register the shares of Benihana&#146;s common stock in the event

Stock and to obtain the consent of Alan B. Levan prior to the conversion of certain of his shares
of our Class&nbsp;B common stock into shares of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. Since our Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock vote as a single class on most matters, Alan B. Levan and John E.
Abdo effectively have the voting power to control the outcome of any shareholder vote and elect the
members of our Board of Directors. Alan B. Levan and John E. Abdo&#146;s control position may have an
adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, except in those limited circumstances where
Florida law mandates that the holders of our Class&nbsp;A common stock vote as a separate class. Alan

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock generally vote together as a single class.
The Class&nbsp;A Common Stock possesses in the aggregate 22% of the total voting power of all our common
stock and the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock possess in the aggregate the remaining 78% of the total voting
power. These relative voting percentages will remain fixed unless the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock outstanding decreases to 1,800,000 shares, at which time the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
aggregate voting power will change to 40% and the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock will have the remaining 60%.
If the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock outstanding decreases to 1,400,000 shares, the
Class&nbsp;A Common Stock aggregate voting power will change to 53% and the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock will
have the remaining 47%. These relative voting percentages will remain fixed unless the number of
shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock outstanding decreases to 500,000 shares, at which time the fixed
voting percentages will be eliminated. These changes in the relative voting power represented by
each class of our common stock are based only on the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock
outstanding, thus issuances of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock will have no effect on these provisions. If
additional shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock are issued, it is likely that the disparity between the
equity interest represented by the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock and its voting power will widen. While the
amendment creating this capital structure was approved by our shareholders, the fixed voting
percentage provisions are somewhat unique. If the market does not sufficiently accept this
structure, the trading price and market for our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock would be adversely affected.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely
impacted as a result of the downturn in the U.S. housing market and general economic conditions.
Dramatic declines in the national and, in particular, Florida housing markets over the past year,
with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, have negatively impacted the
credit performance of our loans and resulted in significant asset impairments at all financial
institutions, including government-sponsored entities, major commercial and investment banks, and
regional and community financial institutions including BankAtlantic. Reflecting concern about the
stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and
institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers, including to other
financial institutions. This market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level
of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility
and widespread reduction of business activity generally. The continuing economic pressure on
consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has adversely affected our business,
financial condition and results of operations. The difficult conditions in the financial markets
and real estate markets are not expected to improve in the foreseeable future. A worsening of these
conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on
BankAtlantic and others in the financial services industry. In particular, we may face the
following risks in connection with these events:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>There can be no assurance that recent steps taken by Congress, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve
will stabilize the U.S. financial system.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;3, 2008, President Bush signed into law the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of
2008, as amended (the &#147;EESA&#148;). The legislation was in response to the financial crises affecting
the banking system and financial markets, and going concern threats to investment banks and other
financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Treasury (the &#147;U.S. Treasury&#148;) and federal banking
regulators are implementing a number of programs under this legislation and otherwise to address
capital and liquidity issues in the banking system, including the U.S. Treasury&#146;s Capital Purchase
Program (the &#147;CPP&#148;), pursuant to which the U.S. Treasury has made senior preferred stock
investments in participating financial institutions. In addition, other regulators have taken steps
to attempt to stabilize and add liquidity to the financial markets, such as the FDIC&#146;s Temporary
Liquidity Guarantee Program, pursuant to which, under the systemic risk exception to the Federal
Deposit Act (the &#147;FDA&#148;), the FDIC has offered a guarantee of certain financial institution
indebtedness in exchange for an insurance premium payment made to the FDIC by the participating
financial institution.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;10, 2009, the Treasury announced a new comprehensive financial stability plan (the
&#147;Financial Stability Plan&#148;), which earmarked the second $350&nbsp;billion originally authorized under
the EESA. The Financial Stability Plan is intended to, among other things, make capital available
to financial institutions, purchase certain legacy loans and assets from financial institutions,
restart securitization markets for loans to consumers and businesses and relieve certain pressures
on the housing market, including the reduction of mortgage payments and interest rates. In
addition, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the &#147;ARRA&#148;), which was signed into
law on February&nbsp;17, 2009, includes, among other things, extensive new restrictions on the
compensation arrangements of financial institutions participating in the CPP.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been numerous actions undertaken in connection with or following EESA, the
Financial Stability Plan and ARRA by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress, the U.S. Treasury,
the FDIC, the SEC and others in efforts to address the current liquidity and credit crisis in the
financial industry that followed the sub-prime mortgage market meltdown which began in late 2007.
These measures include homeowner relief that encourages loan restructuring and modification; the
establishment of significant liquidity and credit facilities for financial institutions and
investment banks; the lowering of the federal funds rate; emergency action against short selling
practices; a temporary guaranty program for money market funds; the establishment of a commercial
paper funding facility to provide back-stop liquidity to commercial paper issuers; coordinated
international efforts to address illiquidity and other weaknesses in the banking sector and other
programs being developed.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be no assurance, however, as to the actual impact that these government initiatives
will have on the financial markets, including the extreme levels of market volatility and limited
credit availability currently being experienced. The failure of these government initiatives to
stabilize the financial markets, or a continuation or worsening of current financial market
conditions, could materially and adversely affect BankAtlantic&#146;s business, financial condition,
results of operations and access to credit. Any such failure may also adversely impact the trading
price of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the EESA, ARRA and the Financial Stability Plan are relatively new initiatives
and, as such, are subject to change and evolving interpretation. There can be no assurances as to
the effects that any further changes will have on the effectiveness of the government&#146;s efforts to
stabilize the credit markets or on BankAtlantic&#146;s business, financial condition or results of
operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously announced, the Company and BankAtlantic filed an application to participate in
the CPP. The United States Treasury had not, as of March&nbsp;16, 2009, acted on the application and
such application may not be approved. Further, the Company&#146;s decision to defer quarterly payment
of interest on its outstanding trust preferred junior subordinated debentures may adversely impact
our application to receive funds under the CPP.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>The impact on us of recently enacted legislation, in particular the EESA and its implementing
regulations, and actions by the FDIC, cannot be predicted at this time.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programs established or to be established under the EESA and Troubled Asset Relief Program
may have adverse effects upon us. Our industry may be subject to increased regulation, and
compliance with such regulations may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business
opportunities. Also, participation in specific programs may subject us to additional restrictions.
For example, if we participate in the CPP, our ability to make dividend payments or to repurchase
our common stock will be limited and subject to the restrictions contained in that program for so
long as any securities issued under such program remain outstanding. It will also subject us to
additional executive compensation restrictions. Similarly, programs established by the FDIC under
the systemic risk exception of the FDA, may have an adverse effect on us and we anticipate that the
cost of FDIC premiums will increase.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>The decline in the Florida real estate market has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely
affect, our earnings and financial condition.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continued deterioration of economic conditions in the Florida residential real estate
market, including the continued decline in home sales and median home prices year-over-year in all
major metropolitan areas in Florida, and the recent downturn in the Florida commercial real estate
market, resulted in a substantial increase in non-performing assets and BankAtlantic&#146;s provision
for loan losses. The housing industry is in the midst of a substantial and prolonged downturn
reflecting, in part, decreased availability of mortgage financing for residential home buyers,
reduced demand for new construction resulting in a significant over-supply of housing inventory and
increased foreclosure rates. Additionally, the deteriorating condition of the Florida economy and
these adverse market conditions have negatively impacted the commercial non-residential real estate
market. BankAtlantic&#146;s earnings and financial condition were adversely impacted during 2008 as the
majority of its loans are secured by real estate in Florida. We expect that our earnings and
financial condition will continue to be unfavorably impacted if market conditions do not improve or
deteriorate further. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolio included $208.1&nbsp;million of
non-accrual loans concentrated in Florida.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Our loan portfolio is concentrated in real estate lending which makes us more susceptible to
credit losses given the current depressed real estate market.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national real estate market declined significantly during 2007 and 2008, particularly in
Florida, BankAtlantic&#146;s primary lending area. BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolio is concentrated in
commercial real estate loans (virtually all of which are located in Florida and many of which
involve residential land development), residential mortgages (nationwide), and consumer home-equity
loans (throughout BankAtlantic&#146;s markets in Florida). BankAtlantic has a heightened exposure to
credit losses that may arise from this concentration as a result of the significant downturn in the
Florida real estate markets. At December&nbsp;31, 2008 BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolio included $2.7
billion of loans concentrated in Florida, which represented approximately 60% of its loan
portfolio.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that BankAtlantic&#146;s commercial residential development loan portfolio has
significant exposure to further declines in the Florida residential real estate market. The
&#147;builder land bank loan&#148; category consists of 7 loans and aggregates $62.4&nbsp;million of which four
loans totaling $40.4&nbsp;million were on non-accrual as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. The &#147;land acquisition
and development loan&#148; category consists of 25 loans and aggregates $165.8&nbsp;million of which three
loans totaling $33.2&nbsp;million were on non-accrual as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. The &#147;land acquisition,
development and construction loan&#148; category consists of 14 loans and aggregates $75.5&nbsp;million of
which three loans totaling $18.5&nbsp;million were on non-accrual as of December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the loans described above, during 2008, the Company formed an asset workout
subsidiary which acquired non-performing commercial and commercial residential real estate loans
from BankAtlantic. The balance of these non-performing loans as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 was $79.3
million with $22.0&nbsp;million, $16.8&nbsp;million and $29.2&nbsp;million of &#147;builder land bank loans&#148;, &#147;land
acquisition and development loans&#148;, and &#147;land acquisition, development and construction loans,
respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market conditions may result in our commercial real estate borrowers having difficulty selling
lots or homes in their developments for an extended period, which in turn could result in an
increase in residential

economic environment continues for a prolonged period of time or deteriorates further, collateral
values may even further decline and are likely to result in increased credit losses in these
loans.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in the commercial real estate loans are approximately $225&nbsp;million of commercial
non-residential construction loans. These loans could be susceptible to extended maturities or
borrower default, and BankAtlantic could experience higher credit losses and non-performing loans
in this portfolio if the economy remains at depressed levels particularly in Florida or if
commercial non-residential real estate market values further decline.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s commercial non-residential loan portfolio includes loans collateralized by
income producing properties such as retail shopping centers, warehouses, and office buildings. The
current recession has negatively impacted the cash flow generated from these rental properties
which in turn impacts the borrowers&#146; ability to fund the debt service on their loans. If market
conditions do not improve or deteriorate further, BankAtlantic may recognize higher credit losses
on these loans, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s commercial real estate loan portfolio includes large lending relationships,
including 5 relationships with unaffiliated borrowers involving lending commitments in each case in
excess of $30&nbsp;million. Defaults by any of these borrowers could have a material adverse effect on
BankAtlantic&#146;s results.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>BankAtlantic&#146;s consumer loan portfolio is concentrated in home equity loans collateralized by

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in residential real estate prices and residential home sales throughout Florida
has resulted in an increase in mortgage delinquencies and higher foreclosure rates. Additionally,
in response to the turmoil in the credit markets, financial institutions have tightened
underwriting standards which has limited borrowers&#146; ability to refinance. These conditions have
adversely impacted delinquencies and credit loss trends in BankAtlantic&#146;s home equity loan
portfolio and it does not currently appear that these conditions will improve in the near term.
Approximately 80% of the loans in BankAtlantic&#146;s home equity portfolio are residential second
mortgages and BankAtlantic experienced heighted delinquencies and credit losses in this portfolio
during 2008. If current economic conditions do not improve and home prices continue to fall,
BankAtlantic may experience higher credit losses from this loan portfolio. Since the collateral
for this portfolio primarily consists of second mortgages, it is unlikely that BankAtlantic will be
successful in recovering all or any portion of its loan proceeds in the event of a default unless
BankAtlantic is prepared to repay the first mortgage and such repayment and the costs associated
with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property

purchased residential loan portfolio (approximately $980&nbsp;million) consists of interest-only loans.
While these loans are not considered sub-prime or negative amortizing loans, they are loans with
reduced initial loan payments with the potential for significant increases in monthly loan payments
in subsequent periods, even if interest rates do not rise, as required amortization of the
principal commences. Monthly loan payments will also increase as interest rates increase. This
presents a potential repayment risk if the borrower is unable to meet the higher debt service
obligations or refinance the loan. As previously noted, current economic conditions in the
residential real estate markets and the mortgage finance markets have made it more difficult for
borrowers to refinance their mortgages which also increases our exposure to loss.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these factors are difficult to predict or estimate accurately, particularly in a
changing economic environment. The process of determining the estimated losses inherent in
BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolio requires subjective and complex judgments and the level of
uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect BankAtlantic&#146;s ability to estimate
the incurred losses in its loan portfolio. If BankAtlantic&#146;s evaluation is incorrect and borrower
defaults cause losses exceeding the portion of the allowance for loan losses allocated to those
loans, our earnings could be significantly and adversely affected. BankAtlantic may experience
losses in its loan portfolios or perceive adverse trends that require it to significantly increase
its allowance for loan losses in the future, which would reduce future earnings.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increases in the allowance for loan losses with respect to the loans held by our asset workout

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are exposed to the risk that our borrowers or counter-parties may default on their
obligations. Credit risk arises through the extension of loans, certain securities, letters of
credit and financial guarantees and through counter-party exposure on trading and wholesale loan
transactions. In an attempt to manage this risk, we seek to establish policies and procedures to
manage both on and off-balance sheet (primarily loan commitments) credit risk.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic attempts to manage credit exposure to individual borrowers and counter-parties on
an aggregate basis including loans, securities, letters of credit, derivatives and unfunded
commitments. While credit personnel analyze the creditworthiness of individual borrowers or
counter-parties, and limits are established for the total credit exposure to any one borrower or
counter-party, such limits may not have the effect of adequately limiting credit exposure.
BankAtlantic also enters into participation agreements with or acquires participation interests
from other lenders to limit its credit risk, but will be subject to risks with respect to its
interest in the loan and will not be in a position to make independent determinations in its sole
discretion with respect to its interests. The majority of BankAtlantic&#146;s residential loans are
serviced by others. The servicing agreements may restrict BankAtlantic&#146;s ability to initiate
work-out and modification arrangements with borrowers which could adversely impact BankAtlantic&#146;s
ability to minimize losses on non-performing loans.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of BankAtlantic&#146;s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, the
earnings and growth of BankAtlantic are significantly affected by interest rates, which are subject
to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign, events in the capital
markets and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies,
particularly the Federal Reserve Board. The nature and timing of any changes in such policies or
general economic conditions and their effect on BankAtlantic cannot be controlled and are extremely
difficult to predict. Changes in interest rates can impact BankAtlantic&#146;s net interest income as
well as the valuation of its assets and liabilities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking is an industry that depends to a large extent on its net interest income. Net

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in interest rates can have differing effects on BankAtlantic&#146;s net interest income. In
particular, changes in market interest rates, changes in the relationships between short-term and
long-term market interest rates, or the yield curve, or changes in the relationships between
different interest rate indices can affect the interest rates charged on interest-earning assets
differently than the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. This difference could
result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income and therefore reduce
BankAtlantic&#146;s net interest income. While BankAtlantic has attempted to structure its asset and
liability management strategies to mitigate the impact on net interest income of changes in market
interest rates, we cannot provide assurances that BankAtlantic will be successful in doing so.

associated with purchased residential loans may result in increased amortization of premiums on

January&nbsp;2005 to August&nbsp;2008 and the related expansion of our infrastructure and operations have
required us to provide additional management resources, hire additional personnel, increase
compensation, occupancy and marketing expenditures, and take steps to enhance and expand our
operational and management information systems. The new stores are located throughout Florida and
represent a 51% increase, based on the number of stores, in BankAtlantic&#146;s retail network.
Employee compensation, occupancy and equipment and advertising expenses have significantly
increased since the inception of the initiative, during 2002, from $78.9&nbsp;million during 2001 to
$212.9&nbsp;million during 2008. The current economic recession has impacted the length of time
required for these new stores to achieve profitability. As a consequence, BankAtlantic is
currently reorganizing its operations in an attempt to improve its performance by significantly
reducing operating expenses while focusing on its core businesses and maintaining quality customer
service. As part of this strategy, since 2007, BankAtlantic has slowed its network expansions and
reduced its services hours and, in 2008, BankAtlantic sold five of its branches located in Orlando
to an independent financial institution. While management is focused on reducing overall expenses,
there is no assurance that BankAtlantic will be successful in efforts to significantly reduce these
expenses and the continuation of the current expense structure may have an adverse impact on our
results.

in declines in deposit accounts or in overdraft frequency resulting in a decline in service charge
income. Also, the downturn in the Florida economy could result in the inability to collect
overdraft fees and a corresponding increase in our overdraft fee reserves.
Additionally, future changes in banking regulations, in particular limitations on retail customer

our results.

significantly increase in 2009 due to the recent experience of the FDIC deposit insurance fund

funds to be in a position to provide additional capital to BankAtlantic, if needed. Additionally,
the OTS could impose capital requirements on the Company or could impose additional capital
requirements on BankAtlantic. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on, among other
things, conditions in the financial markets at the time, which are outside of our control, and our

other companies involved in the financial services industry, the trading price of the Company&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A common stock has recently experienced a substantial decline. Previously, a listed company
would be deemed to be below compliance with the continued listing standards of the New York Stock
Exchange if, among other things, the listed company&#146;s average closing price was less than $1.00
over a consecutive 30 trading day period or the listed company&#146;s average market capitalization was
less than $25&nbsp;million over a consecutive 30 trading day period. As a result of the ongoing turmoil
in the economy generally, the New York Stock Exchange has modified its continued listing standards
to suspend, until June&nbsp;30, 2009, the $1.00 minimum price requirement and to lower, until June&nbsp;30,
2009, the average market capitalization requirement from $25&nbsp;million to $15&nbsp;million.

attempt to cause its Class&nbsp;A common stock to be eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board.
However, the trading price of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock would likely be adversely
impacted, it may become more difficult for the holders of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock to
sell or purchase shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, and it may become more difficult for

preferred junior subordinated debentures that it was electing to defer quarterly interest payments,
which it has the right to do without default or penalty for up to twenty consecutive quarters.
During the deferral period, the Company is not permitted to pay dividends on its common stock.
Not withstanding the deferral, BankAtlantic Bancorp will continue to recognize a liability for the
interest accrued and will be required to accrue interest on the deferred interest. At December&nbsp;31,
2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp had approximately $294.2&nbsp;million of indebtedness outstanding under the
trust preferred junior subordinated debentures at the holding company level with maturities ranging
from 2032 through 2037. The aggregate annual interest payments on this indebtedness were
approximately $18&nbsp;million based on interest rates at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and is generally indexed to

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The downturn in the real estate market, which is now in its fourth year, has become one of the
most severe in U.S. history. This downturn, which resulted from a decline in consumer confidence,
decline in real estate prices and an oversupply of real estate available for sale, has been
exacerbated by, among other things, a decline in the overall economy, increasing unemployment, fear
of job loss and a decline in the securities and credit markets. The government&#146;s legislative and
administrative measures aimed at restoring liquidity to the credit markets and improving conditions
in the real estate markets has only recently begun and there is no indication yet whether these
measures have or will effectively stabilize prices and real estate values or restore consumer
confidence and increase demand in the real estate markets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this downturn, and specifically the adverse impact that the combination of the
lower demand and higher inventories has had on the amount of land that we are able to develop and
sell and the prices at which we are able to sell the land, our operating results and financial
condition have been adversely affected. We cannot predict the duration or ultimate severity of the
current challenging conditions, nor can we provide assurance that our responses to the current
downturn or the government&#146;s attempts to address the troubles in the economy will be successful. If
these conditions persist or continue to worsen, they will further adversely affect our operating
results and financial condition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real estate investments are generally illiquid. Like other companies that invest in real
estate, we have a limited ability to vary our portfolio of real estate investments in response to
changes in economic and other conditions. In addition, as a result of the sustained downturn in the
real estate market, and in the economy in general, the estimated market value of our real estate
properties has decreased and may continue to decrease in the future. Moreover, we may not be able
to timely dispose of properties when we find dispositions advantageous or necessary, or complete
the disposition of properties under contract to be sold, and any such dispositions may not provide
proceeds in excess of the amount of our investment in the property or even in excess of the amount
of any indebtedness secured by the property. As a result, we are susceptible to the risks
associated with further declines in real estate values, including the risk that we may be required
to record additional impairment write-downs with respect to our real estate inventory in the future
if the current real estate environment does not improve or if the market value of our real estate
properties otherwise continues to decline. We had $241.3&nbsp;million of real estate inventory at
December&nbsp;31, 2008.

rental rates, the pace that we will be able to lease new tenants, higher than estimated

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We establish community development district and special assessment district bonds to access
tax-exempt bond financing to fund infrastructure development at Core&#146;s master-planned communities.
We are responsible for any assessed amounts until the underlying property is sold. Accordingly, if
we continue to hold certain of our properties longer than originally projected (as a result of a
continued downturn in the real estate markets or otherwise), we may be required to pay a higher
portion of annual assessments on such properties. In addition, we could be required to pay down a
portion of the bonds in the event our entitlements were to decrease as to the number of residential
units and/or commercial space that can be built on the properties encumbered by the bonds.
Moreover, Core has guaranteed payments for assessments under the district bonds in Tradition,
Florida which would require funding if future assessments to be allocated to property owners are
insufficient to repay the bonds.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The availability of tax-exempt bond financing to fund infrastructure development at Core&#146;s
master-planned communities may be adversely impacted by recent disruptions in credit markets,
including the municipal bond market, by general economic conditions and by fluctuations in the real
estate market. If we are not able to access this type of financing, we would be forced to obtain
substitute financing, and there is no assurance that we would be able to obtain substitute
financing on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are not able to obtain financing for infrastructure
development, Core would be forced to use its own funds or delay development activity at its
master-planned communities.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the nature and size of Core&#146;s individual land transactions, Core&#146;s results and our
consolidated results have historically been subject to significant volatility. Land sale revenues
have been sporadic and have fluctuated dramatically based upon, among other factors, changing sales
prices and costs attributable to the land sold. Due to the current downturn in the real estate
market, margins on land sales may continue to decline and there is no assurance that they will
return to prior levels. If the real estate markets deteriorate further or if the current downturn
is prolonged, we may not be able to sell land at prices above our carrying cost or even in amounts
necessary to repay our indebtedness. In addition to the impact of economic and market factors, the
sales price and margin of land sold varies depending upon: the location; the parcel size; whether
the parcel is sold as raw land, partially developed land or individually developed lots; the degree
to which the land is entitled; and whether the designated use of land is residential or commercial.

real estate developers, both regionally and nationally, for labor as well as raw materials, and the
competition for materials has recently become global. Increased costs in labor and materials could
cause increases in construction costs. In addition, the cost of sales of real estate is dependent
upon the original cost of the land acquired, the timing of the acquisition of the land, and the
amount of land development, interest and real estate tax costs capitalized to the particular land
parcel during active development. Future margins will continue to vary based on these and other
market factors.

occupy its premises could have an adverse effect on the property. A lease termination by an anchor
tenant or a failure by that anchor tenant to occupy the premises could result in lease terminations
or reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping center. Vacated anchor tenant space
also tends to adversely affect the entire shopping center because of the loss of the departed
anchor tenant&#146;s power to draw customers to the center. We may not be able to quickly re-lease

by many factors, including our properties&#146; locations, current market conditions and the provisions
of the leases we enter into with the tenants at our properties. In fact, many of the factors which
could cause our current tenants to vacate their space could also make it more difficult for us to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our real estate operations.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Florida and South Carolina markets in which we operate are subject to the risks of natural
disasters such as hurricanes and tropical storms. These natural disasters could have a material
adverse effect on our business by causing the incurrence of uninsured losses, increased insurance
rates, including homebuyer insurance rates, delays in construction, and shortages and increased
costs of labor and building materials.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to property damage, hurricanes may cause disruptions to our business operations.
Approaching storms may require that operations be suspended in favor of storm preparation
activities. After a storm has passed, construction-related resources such as sub-contracted labor
and building materials are likely to be redeployed to hurricane recovery efforts. Governmental
permitting and inspection activities may similarly be focused primarily on returning displaced
residents to homes damaged by the storms rather than on new construction activity. Depending on the
severity of the damage caused by the storms, disruptions such as these could last for several
months.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>A portion of our revenues from land sales in Core&#146;s master-planned communities are recognized for
accounting purposes under the percentage of completion method. Therefore, if our actual results
differ from our assumptions, our profitability may be reduced.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the percentage of completion method of accounting for recognizing revenue, we record
revenue and cost of sales as work on the project progresses based on the percentage of actual work
incurred compared to the total estimated costs. This method relies on estimates of total expected
project costs. Revenue and cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work
progresses. Adjustments are reflected in sales of real estate and cost of sales in the period when
such estimates are revised. Variation of actual results compared to our estimated costs in Core&#146;s
master-planned communities could cause material changes to our net margins.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Product liability litigation and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be
costly.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our commercial real estate development business is subject to construction defect and product
liability claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the
commercial real estate industries and can be costly. We have, and many of our subcontractors have,
general liability, property, errors and omissions, workers compensation and other business
insurance. However, these insurance policies only protect us against a portion of our risk of loss
from claims. In addition, because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters, we cannot provide
reasonable assurance that our insurance coverage or our subcontractor arrangements will be adequate
to address all warranty, construction defect and liability claims in the future. In addition, the
costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims, if applicable, are
substantial and the amount of coverage offered by insurance companies is also currently limited.
There can be no assurance that this coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly.
If we are not able to obtain adequate insurance against these claims, we may experience losses that
could negatively impact our operating results.

had a $1.1&nbsp;million in surety bonds accrual at Woodbridge related to certain bonds where management
considers it probable that the Company will be required to reimburse the surety under the indemnity
agreement. It is unclear given the uncertainty involved in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases whether and to what
extent the outstanding surety bonds of Levitt and Sons will be drawn and the extent to which
Woodbridge may be responsible for additional amounts beyond this accrual. It is unlikely that
Woodbridge would have the ability to receive any repayment, assets or other consideration as
recovery of any amount it is required to pay. If losses on additional surety bonds are identified,
we will need to take additional charges associated with Woodbridge&#146;s exposure under our

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain loans which provide the primary financing for Tradition, Florida and Tradition Hilton
Head have annual appraisal and re-margining requirements. These provisions may require Core
Communities, in circumstances where the value of its real estate securing these loans declines, to
pay down a portion of the principal amount of the loans to bring the loans within specified minimum
loan-to-value ratios. Accordingly, should land prices decline to the point at which the loans fall
below their specified minimum loan-to-value ratios, reappraisals could result in significant future
re-margining payments. In addition, all of our outstanding debt instruments require us to comply
with certain financial covenants. Further, one of our debt instruments contains cross-default
provisions, which could cause a default on this debt instrument if we default on other debt
instruments. If we fail to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants, the holders of the
applicable debt could cause our debt to become due and payable prior to maturity. These
accelerations or significant re-margining payments could require us to dedicate a substantial
portion of our cash and cash flow from operations to payment of or on our debt and reduce our
ability to use our cash for other purposes.

million, assuming the exercise of all loan extensions available at our discretion, in each case
exclusive of any re-margining payments that could be required in the event that property serving as
collateral becomes impaired, curtailment payments which may be required in the event sales are
below contractual minimums and any additional amounts which may become due upon a sale of the
property securing the loan. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and
future borrowings may not be available under our existing credit facilities or any other financing
sources in an amount sufficient, to enable us to service our indebtedness or fund our other
liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity,
which, due to, among other factors, the recent disruptions in the credit and capital markets, we
may not be able to do on favorable terms or at all.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core is engaging a restructuring firm to review its cash flow models and analyze the terms of
its outstanding indebtedness, and, where appropriate, to enter into discussions with its lenders
relating to a restructuring of Core&#146;s debt. If Core is not successful in restructuring its debt, it
may not have sufficient resources to timely meet its obligations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core&#146;s obligations are independent of Woodbridge and Woodbridge is not legally obligated to
support Core. There is no assurance that Woodbridge will provide additional resources to Core in
the event that Core requires additional funds in order to meet its obligations as they become due.
If Core is not able to meet its obligations as they become due, the lenders under the defaulted
loans could foreclose on any property which serves as collateral for the defaulted loan and Core
could be forced to cease or significantly curtail its operations, which would likely result in
significant impairment charges and losses at Woodbridge.

pursue new investments as currently contemplated using solely our capital on hand. As a result, we
may in the future need to obtain additional financing in an effort to successfully implement our
business strategy. These funds may be obtained through public or private debt or equity financings,
additional bank borrowings or from strategic alliances. We may not be successful in obtaining
additional funds in a timely manner, on favorable terms or at all, especially in light of the
current adverse conditions in the capital and credit markets and, with respect to funding of Core&#146;s
master-planned communities, the adverse conditions in municipal bond markets which may impact our
ability to access tax-exempt bond financing. Moreover, certain of our bank financing agreements
contain provisions that limit the type and amount of debt we may incur in the future without our
lenders&#146; consent. If we are unable to obtain any additional capital necessary to fund our real
estate operations or pursue or consummate new investments, we may be required to delay, scale back
or abandon some or all of our land development activities, or liquidate certain of our assets, and
we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy with respect to new investments.
The occurrence of any of the above events may adversely impact our operating results and financial

increase the costs associated with the investment or acquisition. Our investments or acquisitions
could initially reduce our per share earnings and add significant amortization expense or
intangible asset charges. Since our acquisition strategy involves holding investments for the
foreseeable future and because we do not expect to generate significant excess cash flow from
operations, we may rely on additional debt or equity financing to implement our acquisition
strategy. The issuance of debt will result in additional leverage which could limit our operating
flexibility, and the issuance of equity could result in additional dilution to our then-current
shareholders. In addition, such financing could consist of equity securities which have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to our Class&nbsp;A or Class&nbsp;B Common Stock. We do not intend to seek
shareholder approval of any investments or acquisitions unless required by law or regulation.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We own approximately 9.5&nbsp;million shares of Bluegreen common stock, representing approximately
31% of Bluegreen&#146;s outstanding common stock. During 2008, we evaluated our investment in Bluegreen
for impairment and determined that there was an other-than-temporary impairment associated with
such investment at September&nbsp;30, 2008. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $53.6
million and adjusted the carrying value of our investment in Bluegreen as of September&nbsp;30, 2008
from $119.4&nbsp;million to $65.8&nbsp;million. Additionally, after further evaluation of our investment in
Bluegreen as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, we determined that an additional impairment of our investment in
Bluegreen was appropriate. Accordingly, we recorded a $40.8&nbsp;million impairment charge (calculated
based upon the $3.13 closing price of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on
December&nbsp;31, 2008). The carrying value of our investment in Bluegreen as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 was
$29.8&nbsp;million. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to record a further
impairment charge in the future relating to our investment in Bluegreen. On March&nbsp;13, 2009, the
closing price of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $1.12 per share.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also own approximately 1.4&nbsp;million shares of Office Depot common stock, representing less
than 1% of Office Depot&#146;s outstanding common stock. These shares are accounted for as
available-for-sale securities and are carried at fair value. During 2008, we evaluated our
investment in Office Depot for impairment and determined that an impairment charge was necessary.
Accordingly, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $12.0&nbsp;million associated with our
investment in Office Depot. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the cost of our investment in Office Depot was
$16.3&nbsp;million while the carrying value of such investment, recorded at fair value, was $4.3
million. If current market conditions do not improve or if the trading price of Office Depot&#146;s
common stock does not otherwise increase, then we may be required to record future
other-than-temporary impairment adjustments. On March&nbsp;13, 2009, the closing price of Office Depot&#146;s
common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $1.10 per share.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event we record impairments in the future with respect to our current or future
investments, then the cost of the investment determined to be impaired will be written down to its
fair value with a corresponding charge to earnings, which would adversely impact our financial
condition and operating results.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Bluegreen&#146;s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the shares of
Bluegreen common stock we own may be deemed restricted stock, which would limit our ability to
liquidate our investment in Bluegreen if we choose to do so. In addition, while we have made a
significant investment in Bluegreen, we do not expect to receive any dividends from the company in
the foreseeable future.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, our earnings from our investment in Bluegreen were $9.0
million (after the amortization of approximately $9.2&nbsp;million related to the change in the basis as
a result of the impairment charge at September&nbsp;30, 2008), compared to $10.3&nbsp;million in 2007, and
$9.7&nbsp;million in 2006. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the carrying value of our investment in Bluegreen was
$29.8&nbsp;million. A significant portion of our earnings and book value are dependent upon Bluegreen&#146;s
ability to operate its business plan successfully, which may be difficult given the current
economic environment.

shares of our Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, and 3,735,392 shares, or approximately 22.4%, of our issued and
outstanding Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. In the aggregate, these shares represent approximately 23.6% of
our total equity and approximately 59% of our total voting power. Since our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock vote as a single group on most matters, BFC is in a position to control
our Company and elect a majority of our Board of Directors. Additionally, Alan B. Levan, our
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John E. Abdo, our Vice Chairman, collectively
beneficially own shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock representing approximately 73.8%
of BFC&#146;s total voting power. As a result, Alan B. Levan and John E. Abdo effectively have the
voting power to control the outcome of any vote of our shareholders, except in those limited
circumstances where Florida law mandates that the holders of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock vote as a
separate class. BFC&#146;s interests may conflict with the interests of our other shareholders.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have experienced and continue to experience net operating losses. Under the Internal
Revenue Code, we may utilize our net operating loss carryforwards in certain circumstances to
offset future taxable income and to reduce federal income tax liability, subject to certain
requirements and restrictions. However, if we experience an &#147;ownership change,&#148; as defined in
Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code, then our ability to use our net operating loss
carryforwards could be substantially limited, which could have a negative impact on our financial
position and results of operations. Generally, there is an &#147;ownership change&#148; if, at any time, one
or more shareholders owning 5% or more of a company&#146;s common stock have aggregate increases in
their ownership of such stock of more than 50&nbsp;percentage points over the prior three-year period.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2008, our Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to
preserve shareholder value and protect our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards by
providing a deterrent to holders of less than 5% of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock from acquiring a 5% or
greater ownership interest in our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. However, there can be no assurance that the
shareholder rights plan will successfully prevent against an &#147;ownership change&#148; or otherwise
preserve our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset any future taxable
income, nor can there be any assurance that we will be in a position to utilize our net operating
loss carryforwards in the future even if we do not experience an &#147;ownership change.&#148;

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, the Company failed to meet the minimum continued listing requirements of the New
York Stock Exchange necessary to cause the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock to maintain its listing
on the New York Stock Exchange and, consequently, the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock was de-listed.
The Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock is now quoted on the Pink Sheets. In order to further reduce
costs, the Company may choose to de-register its securities from the Securities and Exchange
Commission, as the cost of public reporting is significant. Pursuant to the rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, if at any time the number of record holders of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
common stock falls below 300, including accounts held through depositories and institutional
custodians, then the Company would be permitted to elect to de-register its securities, which
de-registration would be effective 90&nbsp;days after making the appropriate filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. If the Company de-registers its securities from the Securities and
Exchange Commission, then the Company would cease filing periodic reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, including current reports on Form 8-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and
annual reports on Form 10-K, which would result in less information about the Company being
publicly available to investors. Accordingly, this could result in a lower trading price of the
Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, may make it more difficult for the holders of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
common stock to sell or purchase shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, and may cause it to
be more difficult for the Company to raise capital, which, in the event additional capital is
required to operate the Company&#146;s business, could materially and adversely impact the Company&#146;s
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Woodbridge will continue to seek to lease the remaining space available at this office building
including to affiliates. Core Communities owns its executive office building in Port St. Lucie,
Florida. Woodbridge also has various month-to-month leases on the trailers occupied by it in
Tradition Hilton Head. In addition to Woodbridge&#146;s properties used for offices, Woodbridge
additionally owns commercial space in Florida that is leased to third parties. Because of the
nature of Woodbridge&#146;s real estate operations, significant amounts of property are held as
inventory and property and equipment in the ordinary course of Woodbridge&#146;s business.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Lashelle Farrington, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. BankAtlantic,
a Federal Savings Bank, BA Financial Services, LLC, a Florida limited liability corporation,
BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc., a Florida corporation, BFC Financial Corporation, a Florida
corporation, and Does 1-10, Case No.&nbsp;09-006210 (11), in the Circuit Court of the Seventeenth
Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida.</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On February&nbsp;2, 2009, Lashelle Farington filed a purported class action for state common law breach
of contract and unjust enrichment against BankAtlantic, several of its affiliates, and
various unnamed officers and agents. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that BankAtlantic breached
its Personal Account Depositor&#146;s Agreement by charging overdraft fees for certain debit card
purchases which allegedly did not cause the customers&#146; accounts to be overdrawn at time that they
were paid. The Complaint alleges that rather than following the applicable provisions of the
agreement, BankAtlantic charged overdraft fees for debit card purchases which occurred before the
customer&#146;s account was actually overdrawn.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On the breach of contract claim, the Plaintiff seeks to establish a class comprised of all persons
or entities with BankAtlantic checking accounts who incurred these allegedly improper overdraft
fees on debit card transactions within the previous 5&nbsp;years. On the unjust enrichment claim, the
purported class is the same except that the class period is within the previous 4&nbsp;years. The
Complaint does not allege any specific amount in controversy.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">This case is in the initial stages and BankAtlantic has not yet filed any responsive
pleadings. BankAtlantic believes the claims to be without merit and intends to vigorously
defend the actions.

No.&nbsp;0:07-cv-61542-UU, United States District Court, Southern District of Florida
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On October&nbsp;29, 2007, Joseph C. Hubbard filed a purported class action in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Florida against BankAtlantic Bancorp and four of its current or
former officers. The Complaint, which was later amended on June&nbsp;12, 2008, alleges that during the
purported class period of November&nbsp;9, 2005 through October&nbsp;25, 2007, BankAtlantic Bancorp and the
named officers knowingly and/or recklessly made misrepresentations of material fact regarding
BankAtlantic and specifically BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses. The
Complaint seeks to assert claims for violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule
10b-5 promulgated thereunder and seeks unspecified damages. On December&nbsp;12, 2007, the Court
consolidated into <I>Hubbard </I>a separately filed action captioned <I>Alarm Specialties, Inc. v.
BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc.</I>, No.&nbsp;0:07&#151;cv-61623-WPD that attempted to assert similar claims on
behalf of the same class. On February&nbsp;5, 2008, the Court appointed State-Boston Retirement System
lead plaintiff and Lubaton Sucharow LLP to serve as lead counsel pursuant to the provisions of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. BankAtlantic Bancorp believes the claims to be without
merit and intends to vigorously defend the actions.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On July&nbsp;2, 2008, D.W. Hugo filed a purported class action which was brought as a derivative action
on behalf of BankAtlantic Bancorp pursuant to Florida laws in the United States District Court,
Southern District of Florida against BankAtlantic Bancorp and the above listed officers and
directors. The Complaint alleges that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties by
engaging in certain lending practices with respect to BankAtlantic&#146;s Commercial Real Estate Loan
Portfolio. The Complaint further alleges that BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s public filings and statements
did not fully disclose the risks associated with the Commercial Real Estate Loan Portfolio and
seeks damages on behalf of BankAtlantic Bancorp. On December&nbsp;2, 2008, the Circuit Court for
Broward County stayed a separately filed action captioned <I>Albert R. Feldman, Derivatively on behalf
of Nominal Defendant BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. vs. Alan B. Levan, et al., </I>Case No.&nbsp;0846795 07
which attempted to assert substantially the same allegations as in the <I>Hugo </I>matter, but with
somewhat different state law causes of action. The court granted the motion to stay the action

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On December&nbsp;20, 2007, Wilmine Almonor filed a purported class action in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Florida against BankAtlantic Bancorp and the above-listed
officers, directors, employees, and organizations. The Complaint alleges that during the purported
class period of November&nbsp;9, 2005 to present, BankAtlantic Bancorp and the individual defendants
violated the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (&#147;ERISA&#148;) by permitting company employees to
choose to invest in BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock in light of the facts alleged in
the <I>Hubbard </I>securities lawsuit. The Complaint seeks to assert claims for breach of fiduciary
duties, the duty to provide accurate information, the duty to avoid conflicts of interest under
ERISA and seeks unspecified damages. On February&nbsp;18, 2009, the Plaintiff filed a second amended
complaint. BankAtlantic Bancorp believes the claims to be without merit and intends to vigorously
defend the actions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In October&nbsp;2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp received a subpoena and notice of investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Miami Regional Office. The subpoena requests a broad range of
documents relating to, among other matters, recent and pending litigation to which BankAtlantic
Bancorp is or was a party, certain of BankAtlantic&#146;s non-performing, non-accrual and charged-off
loans, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s cost saving measures, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s recently formed asset
workout subsidiary and any purchases or sale of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s common stock by officers or
directors of BankAtlantic Bancorp. BankAtlantic Bancorp intends to fully cooperate and provide the
requested documentation.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On November&nbsp;9, 2007, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases in
the Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors commenced the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases in order to preserve the value of
their assets and to facilitate an orderly wind-down of their businesses and disposition of their
assets in a manner intended to maximize the recoveries of all constituents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On November&nbsp;27, 2007, the Office of the United States Trustee (the &#147;U.S. Trustee), appointed an
official committee of unsecured creditors in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases (the &#147;Creditors&#146; Committee&#148;). On
January&nbsp;22, 2008, the U.S. Trustee appointed a <I>Joint Home Purchase Deposit Creditors Committee of
Creditors Holding Unsecured Claims </I>(the &#147;Deposit Holders Committee&#148;, and together with the
Creditors Committee, the &#147;Committees&#148;) The Committees have a right to appear and be heard in the
Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On November&nbsp;27, 2007, the Bankruptcy Court granted the <I>Debtors&#146; Motion for Authority to Incur
Chapter&nbsp;11 Administrative Expense Claim </I>(&#147;Chapter&nbsp;11 Admin. Expense Motion&#148;) thereby authorizing
the Debtors to incur a post petition administrative expense claim in favor of Woodbridge for Post
Petition Services. While the Bankruptcy Court approved the incurrence of the amounts as unsecured
post petition administrative expense claims, the cash payments of such claims was subject to
additional court approval. In addition to the unsecured administrative expense claims, Woodbridge
had pre-petition secured and unsecured claims against the Debtors. The Debtors scheduled the
amounts due to Woodbridge in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. Woodbridge&#146;s unsecured pre-petition claims
scheduled by Levitt and Sons were approximately $67.3&nbsp;million and the secured pre-petition claim
scheduled by Levitt and Sons is approximately $460,000. Woodbridge also filed contingent claims
with respect to any liability Woodbridge may have arising out of disputed indemnification
obligations under certain surety bonds. Lastly, Woodbridge implemented an employee severance fund
in favor of certain employees of the Debtors. Employees who received funds as part of this program
as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, which totaled approximately $3.9&nbsp;million paid as of that date, have
assigned their unsecured claims to Woodbridge.

Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, among other things, (i)&nbsp;Woodbridge agreed
to pay to the Debtors&#146; bankruptcy estates the sum of $12.5&nbsp;million plus accrued interest from May
22, 2008 through the date of payment, (ii)&nbsp;Woodbridge agreed to waive and release substantially all
of the claims it had against the Debtors, including its administrative expense claims through
July&nbsp;2008, and (iii)&nbsp;the Debtors (joined by the Joint Committee) agreed to waive and release any
claims they had against Woodbridge and its affiliates. After certain of Levitt and Sons&#146; creditors
indicated that they objected to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and stated a desire to pursue
claims against Woodbridge, Woodbridge, the Debtors and the Joint Committee entered into an
amendment to the Settlement Agreement, pursuant to which Woodbridge would, in lieu of the $12.5
million payment previously agreed to, pay $8&nbsp;million to the Debtors&#146; bankruptcy estates and place
$4.5&nbsp;million in a release fund to be disbursed to third party creditors in exchange for a third
party release and injunction. The amendment also provided for an additional $300,000 payment by
Woodbridge to a deposit holders fund. The Settlement Agreement, as amended, was subject to a number
of conditions, including the approval of the Bankruptcy Court. On February&nbsp;20, 2009, the Bankruptcy
Court presiding over Levitt and Sons&#146; Chapter&nbsp;11 bankruptcy case entered an order confirming a plan
of liquidation jointly proposed by Levitt and Sons and the Official Committee of Unsecured
Creditors. That order also approved the settlement pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, as
amended. No appeal or rehearing of the court&#146;s order was timely filed by any party, and the
settlement was consummated on March&nbsp;3, 2009.

Corp. (formerly known as Levitt Corp.), Alan B. Levan, and George P. Scanlon, Case No.
08-60111-Civ-Graham/O&#146;Sullivan, Southern District of Florida</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On January&nbsp;25, 2008, plaintiff Robert D. Dance filed a purported class action complaint as a
putative purchaser of securities against Woodbridge and certain of its officers and directors,
asserting claims under the federal securities law and seeking damages. This action was filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and is captioned Dance v.
Levitt Corp. et al., No.&nbsp;08-CV-60111-DLG. The securities litigation purports to be brought on
behalf of all purchasers of Woodbridge&#146;s securities beginning on January&nbsp;31, 2007 and ending on
August&nbsp;14, 2007. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of
the Exchange Act, and Rule&nbsp;10b-5 promulgated thereunder by issuing a series of false and/or
misleading statements concerning Woodbridge&#146;s financial results, prospects and condition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Westchester Fire Insurance Company vs. City of Brooksville Case No.&nbsp;8: CA-09-486</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On February&nbsp;9, 2009, the City of Brooksville, Florida filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of the
Fifth Judicial Circuit in and for Hernando County, Florida. Woodbridge was named as one of the
defendants. The lawsuit alleged that Woodbridge failed to construct certain public works projects
in the City as it was required to do under a Plat Approval granted by the City for the Cascades at
Southern Hills project. The lawsuit sought recovery from Westchester Fire Insurance Company, which
provided surety bonds for Woodbridge&#146;s performance of the public works. Although Woodbridge was
named as a defendant, no cause of action was asserted against Woodbridge. The case was
subsequently voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. Separately, on January&nbsp;16, 2009, a federal
declaratory action was filed by Westchester Fire against the City of Brooksville, Florida in the
Federal District Curt for the Middle District of Florida. Woodbridge is not a party in that
litigation. However, it is anticipated that the federal court declaratory action will resolve the
dispute between all parties in its entirety. Based on the claim made by the City on the bonds, at
the surety&#146;s request, Woodbridge posted a $4.0&nbsp;million letter of credit as security while the
matter is litigated with the City.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also parties to lawsuits
as plaintiff or defendant involving its bank operations, lending, tax certificates activities and
real estate development activities. Although it is believed that there are meritorious defenses in
all pending legal actions, the outcome of legal actions is uncertain. Management does not believe
its results of operations or financial condition will be materially impacted by the resolution of
these matters which arise in the ordinary course of business.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are restrictions on the payment of dividends by BankAtlantic to BankAtlantic Bancorp and
in certain circumstances on the payment of dividends by BankAtlantic Bancorp to holders of its
common stock, including BFC. In February&nbsp;2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp elected to exercise its right
to defer payments of interest on its outstanding junior subordinated debt associated with its trust
preferred securities. BankAtlantic Bancorp is permitted to defer quarterly interest payments for up
to 20 consecutive quarters. During the deferral period, BankAtlantic Bancorp will not pay dividends
to its common shareholders, including BFC. BankAtlantic Bancorp can end the deferral period at any
time. The availability of funds for dividend payments by BankAtlantic Bancorp depends upon
BankAtlantic&#146;s ability to pay dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp. Current regulations applicable to
the payment of cash dividends by savings institutions impose limits on capital distributions based
on an institution&#146;s regulatory capital levels, retained net income and net income. See Financial
Services Risk Factors &#150; &#147;BankAtlantic Bancorp services its debt and pays dividends primarily from
dividends from BankAtlantic, which are subject to regulatory limits&#148; and Regulation and Supervision

payment of dividends in the future is subject to approval by Woodbridge&#146;s Board of Directors and
will depend upon, among other factors, Woodbridge&#146;s results of operations and financial condition.
While Woodbridge&#146;s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share on its Class&nbsp;A
common stock and Class&nbsp;B common stock, which was paid in February&nbsp;2007, it is not anticipated that
Woodbridge&#146;s Board of Directors will declare cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;21, 2006, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to
1,750,000 shares of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock through open market or private transactions at an
aggregate cost of no more than $10&nbsp;million. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will
depend on market conditions, share price, trading volume and other factors, and there is no
assurance that the Company will repurchase shares during any period. No termination date was set
for the repurchase program. The shares purchased in this program will be retired and cancelled.
The chart below provides information concerning shares repurchased during the quarter ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC Financial Corporation (&#147;BFC&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a diversified holding company whose
major holdings include controlling interests in BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries (&#147;BankAtlantic Bancorp&#148;) and Woodbridge Holdings Corporation (formerly known as Levitt
Corporation) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (&#147;Woodbridge&#148;) and a noncontrolling interest in
Benihana, Inc., which operates Asian-themed restaurant chains in the United States. As a result of
the Company&#146;s position as the controlling shareholder of BankAtlantic Bancorp, BFC is a &#147;unitary
savings bank holding company&#148; regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, BFC&#146;s business strategy has been to invest in and acquire businesses in diverse
industries either directly or through controlled subsidiaries. BFC believes that the best potential
for growth is likely through the growth of the companies it currently controls and its focus is to
provide overall support for its controlled subsidiaries with a view to the improved performance of
the organization as a whole. During the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2008, the Company aligned its staff
to this goal by transferring approximately seven employees to its subsidiary in an effort to seek
potentially greater value to the overall organization at that level.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s primary activities relate to managing its investments. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008,
BFC had total consolidated assets and liabilities of approximately $6.4&nbsp;billion and $6.0&nbsp;billion,
respectively, including the assets and liabilities of its consolidated subsidiaries, noncontrolling
interests of $262.6&nbsp;million, and shareholders&#146; equity of
approximately $112.9&nbsp;million. We report
our results of operations through five reportable segments, which are: BFC Activities,
BankAtlantic, BankAtlantic Bancorp Other Operations, Land Division and Woodbridge Other Operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Services division includes BankAtlantic Bancorp results of operations and
consists of two reportable segments, which are: BankAtlantic and BankAtlantic Bancorp Other
operations. The Real Estate Development division includes Woodbridge&#146;s results of operations and
consists of two reportable segments, which are: Land Division and Woodbridge Other Operations. In
2007, the Company operated through two additional reportable segments, Primary Homebuilding and
Tennessee Homebuilding, both of which were eliminated as a result of Levitt and Sons&#146;
deconsolidation.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a holding company with controlling positions in BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge, BFC is
required under generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) to consolidate the financial
results of these companies. As a consequence, the financial information of both entities is
presented on a consolidated basis in BFC&#146;s financial statements. However, except as otherwise
noted, the debts and obligations of BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge are not direct obligations
of BFC and are non-recourse to BFC. Similarly, the assets of those entities are not available to
BFC absent its pro rata share in a dividend or distribution.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge each completed a one-for-five reverse

to reflect the reverse stock splits effected by BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge. The reverse

    <TD>In August&nbsp;2008 and December&nbsp;2008, BFC purchased an aggregate of 400,000 shares and
323,848 shares, respectively, of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock on the open
market for an aggregate purchase price of $2.8&nbsp;million and $1.1&nbsp;million, respectively.
BFC&#146;s August&nbsp;2008 and December&nbsp;2008 acquisitions of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common
stock increased BFC&#146;s ownership interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp by approximately 3.6% in
August&nbsp;2008 and 2.9% in December&nbsp;2008 and increased BFC&#146;s voting interest by approximately
2.1% in August&nbsp;2008 and 1.6% in December&nbsp;2008. The acquisitions of additional shares of
BankAtlantic Bancorp have been accounted for as step acquisitions under the purchase method
of accounting. See Note 2 for further information.</TD>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company reported a net loss of $58.9&nbsp;million in 2008 as compared to a net loss of $30.5
million in 2007 and a net loss of $2.2&nbsp;million in 2006. Results for the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2008, 2007 and 2006 included $4.5&nbsp;million income, $1.0&nbsp;million income and a $1.5&nbsp;million loss from discontinued
operations net of noncontrolling interest and income tax, respectively. The results from
discontinued operations related to financial results associated with Ryan Beck (see Note 3 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item&nbsp;8 of this report for additional
information). In 2008, the Company acquired additional shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock in the open market, and in 2007 the Company acquired additional shares of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock in Woodbridge&#146;s Rights Offerings to its shareholders, including
the Company. The acquisition of these shares resulted in negative goodwill (based on the excess of
fair value of acquired net assets over the purchase price of the shares) of approximately $19.6
million in connection with the 2008 acquisitions of additional shares of BankAtlantic Bancorp and
$11&nbsp;million in connection with the 2007 acquisition of additional shares in Woodbridge. After
ratably allocating this negative goodwill to non-current and non-financial assets, the Company
recognized in 2008 and 2007 an extraordinary gain, net of tax, of $9.1&nbsp;million and $2.4&nbsp;million,
respectively.

impairment charges) relating to its investment in Office Depot and BFC&#146;s net increase in the reclassification of its investment in Benihana Convertible Preferred

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;7, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company designated 15,000 shares of the
preferred stock as 5% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (&#147;5% Preferred Stock&#148;) and, on June
21, 2004, sold the shares of the 5% Preferred Stock to an investor group in a private offering. On
December&nbsp;17, 2008, the Company amended Article&nbsp;IV of the Company&#146;s Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation (the &#147;Amendment&#148;) with the Florida Department of State to amend certain of the
previously designated relative rights, preferences and limitations of the Company&#146;s 5% Preferred
Stock (see Note 34 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item&nbsp;8 of this report
for additional information).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective
with the Amendment in December&nbsp;2008 and in accordance with Accounting Series Release No.&nbsp;268 (&#147;ASR 268&#148;), the Company
determined that the 5% Preferred Stock met the requirements to be re-classified outside of
permanent equity at its fair value at the Amendment date of approximately $11.0&nbsp;million into the
mezzanine category as Redeemable 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock at December&nbsp;31, 2008 in the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The fair value of the 5% Preferred Stock
was obtained by using an income approach by discounting estimated cash flows at a market discount
rate. Prior to the Amendment in December&nbsp;2008 for all periods presented, the 5% Preferred Stock is
presented in permanent equity at its stated value of approximately $15.0&nbsp;million. At December&nbsp;31,
2008, $11.0&nbsp;million has been re-classified as Redeemable 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock and the
remaining amount of approximately $4.0&nbsp;million remains classified in Additional Paid in Capital.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Impact of Inflation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial statements and related financial data and notes presented herein have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the
measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without
considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature by virtue of our ownership
interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our
performance than the effects of general price levels. Although interest rates generally move in the
same direction as inflation, the magnitude of such change varies. The possible effect of
fluctuating interest rates is discussed more fully under the section entitled &#147;Consolidated
Interest Rate Risk&#148; In Item&nbsp;7A below.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflation could have a long-term impact on our real estate activities because any increase in
the cost of land, materials and labor would result in a need to increase the sales prices of land
which may not be possible. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates
which could have a negative impact on demand and the costs of financing land development
activities. Rising interest rates as well as increased materials and labor costs may reduce
margins. Our real estate activities, which primarily consist of the activities of Woodbridge, are
discussed more fully below under the section entitled &#147;Real Estate Development&#148;.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Critical Accounting Policies</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management views critical accounting policies as accounting policies that are important to the
understanding of our financial statements and also involve estimates and judgments about inherently
uncertain matters. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial
condition and assumptions that affect the recognition of income and expenses on the consolidated
statement of operations for the periods presented. Actual results could differ significantly from
those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in
subsequent periods relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, evaluation of
goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, the valuation of real estate acquired in
connection with foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans, the valuation of real estate held for
development and sale and its impairment reserves, revenue and cost recognition on percent complete
projects, estimated costs to complete construction, the valuation of investments in unconsolidated
subsidiaries, the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities in the application of the
purchase method of accounting, accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowance, accounting
for uncertain tax positions, accounting for contingencies, and assumptions used in the valuation of
stock based compensation. The accounting policies that we have identified as critical accounting
policies are: (i)&nbsp;allowance for loan losses; (ii)&nbsp;valuation of securities as well as the
determination of other-than-temporary declines in value; (iii)&nbsp;impairment of goodwill and other
indefinite life intangible assets; (iv)&nbsp;impairment of long-lived assets; (v)&nbsp;accounting for
business combinations; (vi)&nbsp;the valuation of real estate held for development and sale; (vii)&nbsp;the
valuation of unconsolidated subsidiaries; (viii)&nbsp;accounting for deferred tax asset valuation
allowance; (ix)&nbsp;accounting for contingencies; and (x)&nbsp;accounting for share-based compensation.

other than BankAtlantic Bancorp and its subsidiaries and Woodbridge and its subsidiaries. Pursuant
to the terms of shared service agreements between BFC, BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge, BFC
provides shared service operations in the areas of human resources, risk management, investor
relations, executive office administration and other services to BankAtlantic Bancorp and
Woodbridge. Additionally, BFC provides certain risk management and administrative services to
Bluegreen. The costs of shared services are allocated based upon the usage of the respective
services. This segment also includes BFC&#146;s overhead expenses, interest income and dividend income
from BFC&#146;s investment in Benihana&#146;s convertible preferred stock, the financial results of a venture
partnership that BFC controls, and financial results from BFC/CCC, Inc. (formerly known as Cypress
Creek Capital, Inc.) (&#147;BFC/CCC&#148;). During the second quarter of 2008, approximately seven employees
previously employed by BFC became employees of Woodbridge where we believe they can potentially

described earlier. The Company&#146;s earnings or losses in BankAtlantic Bancorp are included in our
Financial Services division which consists of two reportable segments, which are: BankAtlantic and
BankAtlantic Bancorp Other Operations. The Company&#146;s earnings and losses in Woodbridge in 2008 are
included in two reportable segments, which are Land Division and Woodbridge Other Operations. In
2007 Woodbridge&#146;s earnings and losses included two additional reportable business segments, Primary
Homebuilding and Tennessee Homebuilding, both of which have been eliminated as a result of Levitt
and Sons&#146; deconsolidation following its bankruptcy filing in November&nbsp;2007.

compared to 2007 and 2006 resulted from lower cash and cash equivalent balances and lower average
yields on those balances. The increase interest and dividend income during the year ended December
31, 2007 as compared to 2006 resulted from interest income earned on higher cash balances as a
consequence of the public offering of equity consummated in 2007.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Securities activities related to gains on the sale of publicly traded equity securities,
$103,000 of which was realized in 2008 by a venture partnership that BFC controls.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in other income in 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 was primarily due
to lower income at BFC/CCC. This decrease in other income was partially offset with an increase in
shared service income. The increase in other income in 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006
was primarily due to higher income from advisory fees earned at BFC/CCC and shared service income.
In 2008, 2007 and 2006, BFC/CCC income was approximately $1.4&nbsp;million, $1.7&nbsp;million and $929,000,
respectively. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, shared service income was approximately $3.1&nbsp;million, $2.9
million and $2.5&nbsp;million, respectively. BFC also recognized similar expenses related to shared
service operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in employee compensation and benefits in 2008 as compared to the same period in
2007 was primarily due to the decline in executive officers incentive bonus of approximately
$913,000, as well as a decline in compensation and benefits of approximately $1.1&nbsp;million primarily
associated with the transfer of BFC/CCC&#146;s employees to Woodbridge. The increase in employee
compensation and benefits during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily
due to increases in i) the level of compensation and additional employees in BFC&#146;s shared service
operations, ii) bonus expense of approximately $390,000 of which $200,000 related to the completion
of certain projects at BFC/CCC and additional bonuses to executive officers, iii) stock
compensation expense of approximately $308,000 and iv) a provision for severance in the amount of
$250,000 due to a restructuring of BFC/CCC&#146;s operations. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, BFC had 9
employees dedicated to BFC operations and 29 employees providing shared services to BFC and the
affiliate companies. At December&nbsp;31, 2007, BFC had 12 employees dedicated to BFC operations, 11
employees in BFC/CCC, and 25 employees providing shared services to BFC and the affiliate
companies.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other expenses decreased in 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 primarily due to a
write-off of $619,000 related to the abandonment of a proposed merger with Woodbridge which was
terminated in August&nbsp;2007. Other expenses increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to
the write-off of the $619,000 proposed merger cost with Woodbridge and increased legal and
professional and consulting fees.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impairment of investment in 2008 related to BFC&#146;s investment in Benihana Convertible Preferred
Stock. During the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company performed an impairment review of
its investment in Benihana Convertible Preferred Stock to determine if an impairment adjustment was
needed. &nbsp;Based on the evaluation and the review of various qualitative and quantitative factors,
including the decline in the underlying trading value of Benihana&#146;s common stock and the redemption
provisions of the Company&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company determined that there was an
other-than-temporary decline of approximately $3.6&nbsp;million, and accordingly, the investment was
written down to its fair value of approximately $16.4&nbsp;million. Concurrent with management&#146;s
evaluation of the impairment of this investment at December&nbsp;31, 2008, it made the determination to
reclassify this investment from investment securities which are carried at cost to investment
securities available for sale in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;115, &#147;Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities.&#148;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC Activities include the (benefit)&nbsp;provision for income taxes associated with our equity
earnings (losses)&nbsp;in Woodbridge for the periods ended and the tax effect of our equity earnings
(losses)&nbsp;in BankAtlantic Bancorp. BFC&#146;s current business strategy is to hold its investment in
BankAtlantic Bancorp indefinitely. Accordingly, based on the Company&#146;s change in intent as to the
expected manner of recovery of its investment in BankAtlantic Bancorp, the Company reversed its
deferred tax liability of $29.3&nbsp;million during the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008, a
 valuation allowance of approximately $28.3&nbsp;million was established against BFC&#146;s
deferred tax asset primarily resulting from BFC&#146;s net operation loss (&#147;NOLs&#148;) carryforwards,
because based on available evidence it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will
not be realized. For further information see Note 25 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item&nbsp;8 of this report.

current year losses from BFC Activities), tax benefits not recognized on our equity losses from

accounting. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities acquired have been revalued to reflect market
values at the respective dates of acquisition. For further information see Note 2 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item&nbsp;8 of this report. The discounts and premiums arising
as a result of such revaluation are generally being accreted or amortized, net of tax, over the
remaining life of the assets and liabilities. The net impact of such accretion, amortization and
other purchase accounting adjustments decreased our consolidated net loss during 2008 by
approximately $8.4&nbsp;million of which approximately $4.7&nbsp;million and $1.7&nbsp;million was due to the
purchase accounting associated with the investment in Bluegreen and goodwill, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in cash used in operating activities during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily
resulted from lower income resulting from a decline in interest income earned from cash
equivalents and a decline in BFC/CCC&#146;s income. This increase in cash used in operating activities
was partially offset by lower operating and general and administrative expenses. The increase in
cash used in operating activities during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily resulted from higher
operating and general administrative expenses, net of revenues received from BFC/CCC.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in cash used in investing activities during 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily
due to the purchase in 2007 of 3,320,543 shares of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock in
Woodbridge&#146;s rights offering (such shares were subsequently issued to BFC on October&nbsp;1, 2007) for
approximately $33.2&nbsp;million, while in 2008 the Company purchased an aggregate of 723,848 shares of
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock in the open market for approximately $3.9&nbsp;million. In
2008, the decline in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by cash proceeds
received from a venture partnership&#146;s distribution and proceeds received from the sale of its
equity securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2007 compared to 2006
primarily resulted from BFC&#146;s purchase of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock in the Rights Offering
as discussed above. This increase in cash used in investing activities in 2007 was partially
offset by cash provided by the proceeds received from the sale of equity securities and from the
sale of a real estate investment.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in cash provided by financing activities during 2008 compared to 2007 was
primarily associated with BFC&#146;s public offering in July&nbsp;2007, in which BFC sold 11,500,000 shares
of its Class&nbsp;A Common Stock at $3.40 per share pursuant to a registered underwritten public
offering. Net proceeds from the sale of the 11,500,000 shares totaled approximately $36.2&nbsp;million,
after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. BFC primarily used the proceeds
of this offering to participate in Woodbridge&#146;s Rights Offering as described above and for general
corporate purposes, including working capital. In 2007, cash provided by financing activities
resulted from net proceeds from BFC&#146;s public offering offset by the payment of dividends on the
Company&#146;s 5% Preferred Stock of $750,000. In 2006, cash used in financing activities resulted from
the payment of approximately $4.2&nbsp;million of optionees&#146; minimum withholding tax upon the exercise
of stock options and the payment of dividends on the Company&#146;s 5% Preferred Stock of $750,000. BFC
accepted shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock as consideration for the exercise price of stock options
and for the payment of optionees&#146; minimum withholding taxes related to options exercised.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;24, 2006, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to
1,750,000 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of no more than $10.0&nbsp;million. In 2008,
the Company repurchased in the open market an aggregate of 100,000 shares at an average price of
$0.54 per share. As a result of these shares repurchases, 1,650,000 shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock remain available for repurchase under the plan. These remaining shares may be
repurchased in the open market or through private transactions. The timing and the amount of
repurchases, if any, will depend on market conditions, share price, trading volume and other
factors, and there is no assurance that the Company will repurchase any or all of the remaining shares in the future.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability of BankAtlantic to pay dividends or make other distributions to BankAtlantic
Bancorp in subsequent periods is subject to regulations and Office of Thrift Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;)
approval and is based upon BankAtlantic&#146;s regulatory capital levels and net income. Because
BankAtlantic has an accumulated deficit during the prior two years, BankAtlantic is required to
file an application to receive approval from the OTS in order to pay dividends to BankAtlantic
Bancorp. The OTS would not approve any distribution that would cause BankAtlantic to fail to meet
its capital requirements or if the OTS believes that a capital distribution by BankAtlantic
constitutes an unsafe or unsound action or practice and there is no assurance that the OTS will
approve future capital distributions from BankAtlantic. BankAtlantic has not filed an application
with the OTS for approval to pay a dividend since September&nbsp;2008 and BankAtlantic Bancorp does not
expect to receive cash dividends from BankAtlantic during 2009, and possibly longer. However,
BankAtlantic Bancorp may receive dividends from its asset work-out subsidiary upon the monetizing
of the subsidiaries&#146; non-performing loans. In February&nbsp;2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp elected to
defer regularly scheduled interest payments on all of its outstanding junior subordinated
debentures relating to its outstanding trust preferred securities, and during the deferral period,
BankAtlantic Bancorp may not, among other things and with limited exceptions, pay cash dividends on
or repurchase its common stock nor make any payment on outstanding debt obligations that rank
equally with or junior to the junior subordinated debentures. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic
met all applicable liquidity and regulatory capital requirements. During the year ended December
31, 2008, the Company received approximately $208,000 in dividends from BankAtlantic Bancorp.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2008, the U.S. Treasury announced the Capital Purchase Program (&#147;CPP&#148; or &#147;Program&#148;)
to invest capital into U.S. financial institutions pursuant to which institutions may issue senior
preferred stock to the Treasury and receive proceeds of up to 3&nbsp;percent of risk-weighted assets.
The Program requires that in conjunction with the issuance of senior preferred shares, the Treasury
will receive warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to 15&nbsp;percent
of the investment in senior preferred stock with the exercise price equal to the market price of
the participating institution&#146;s common stock at the time of approval, calculated on a 20-trading
day trailing average. Financial institutions that participate will be subject to certain
restrictions and covenants as may be required by the Treasury. BankAtlantic Bancorp and
BankAtlantic have submitted an application for CPP funds; however, there is no assurance that
BankAtlantic Bancorp or BankAtlantic will participate in the Treasury&#146;s Program or of the amount of
any such participation. To date, the Treasury has not acted on the application. In the event
BankAtlantic Bancorp or BankAtlantic receive approval for participation in the CPP and choose to do
so, BankAtlantic Bancorp expects that they would end the deferral of interest payments on its
junior subordinated debentures using existing funds.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge has not paid any dividends since the first quarter of 2007, and the Company does
not anticipate that it will receive additional dividends from Woodbridge for the foreseeable
future. Any future dividends are subject to approval by Woodbridge&#146;s Board of Directors and will
depend upon, among other factors, Woodbridge&#146;s results of operations and financial condition.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;17, 2008, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to amend certain of
the previously designated relative rights, preferences and limitations of the Company&#146;s 5%
Preferred Stock. The Amendment eliminates the right of the holders of the 5% Preferred Stock to
convert their shares of Preferred Stock into shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. The
Amendment also requires the Company to redeem shares of the 5% Preferred Stock with the net
proceeds it receives in the event (i)&nbsp;the Company sells any of its shares of Series&nbsp;B Convertible
Preferred Stock (the &#147;Benihana Preferred Stock&#148;) of Benihana, Inc. (&#147;Benihana&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;the Company
sells any shares of Benihana&#146;s common stock received upon conversion of the Benihana Preferred
Stock or (iii)&nbsp;Benihana redeems any shares of the Benihana Preferred Stock owned by the Company.
Additionally, in the event the Company defaults on its obligation to make dividend payments on the
5% Preferred Stock, the Amendment entitles the holders of the 5% Preferred Stock, in place of the
Company, to receive directly from Benihana certain payments on the shares of Benihana Preferred
Stock owned by the Company or on the shares of Benihana&#146;s common stock received by the Company upon
conversion of the Benihana Preferred Stock. The investment in Benihana Preferred Stock is subject
to mandatory redemption on July&nbsp;2, 2014. The date may be
extended by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Benihana Preferred
Stock to a date no later

Stock that it purchased for $25.00 per share. The Company has the right to receive cumulative
quarterly dividends at an annual rate equal to 5% or $1.25 per share, payable on the last day of
each calendar quarter. It is anticipated that the Company will continue to receive approximately
$250,000 per quarter in dividends on the Benihana Series&nbsp;B Convertible Preferred Stock (see Note 12 for further information).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;21, 2004, the Company sold 15,000 shares of the 5% Preferred Stock to an investor
group in a private offering. In December&nbsp;2008, the purchase agreement of the 5% Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock was amended as described above. Effective with the Amendment (discussed
above), the Company determined that the 5% Preferred Stock met the requirements to be re-classified
outside of permanent equity at its fair value at the Amendment date of approximately $11.0&nbsp;million
into the mezzanine category as Redeemable 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock at December&nbsp;31, 2008 in the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition (see Note 34 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statement in Item&nbsp;8 of this report). The 5% Preferred Stock has a stated
value of $1,000 per share. The shares of 5% Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the option of the
Company, from time to time, at redemption prices (the &#147;Redemption Price&#148;) ranging from $1,030 per
share for the year 2009 to $1,000 per share for the year 2015 and thereafter. The 5% Preferred
Stock liquidation preference is equal to its stated value of $1,000 per share plus any accumulated
and unpaid dividends or an amount equal to the Redemption Price in a voluntary liquidation or
winding up of the Company. Holders of the 5% Preferred Stock have no voting rights into the Company
and are entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, cumulative quarterly
cash dividends on each such share at a rate per annum of 5% of the stated value from the date of
issuance, payable quarterly. Since June&nbsp;2004, the Company has paid dividends on the preferred stock
of $187,500 on a quarterly basis.

Boca Raton, Florida, and in connection with the purchase of such office building in March&nbsp;2006,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant decline in BankAtlantic&#146;s performance during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008
compared to the same 2007 period primarily resulted from a $48.3&nbsp;million goodwill impairment
charge, the establishment of a $66.9&nbsp;million deferred tax valuation allowance, a $64.5&nbsp;million
increase in the provision for loan losses and a decline in non-interest income. These items were
partially offset by lower non-interest expenses excluding the goodwill impairment. The goodwill in
our community banking and commercial lending business units was determined to be impaired primarily
due to the on-going downward trends in the financial services industry affecting the Company&#146;s
market capitalization and the continued decline in the credit quality of BankAtlantic&#146;s loan
portfolio. Based on net losses in recent years and the uncertainty in the current adverse economic
environment, management considered it prudent to establish a deferred tax valuation allowance on
its entire net deferred tax asset. BankAtlantic would recognize a benefit for the reversal of its
deferred tax asset valuation allowance if BankAtlantic generates sufficient taxable income in the
future to utilize the tax benefit related to the net deferred tax assets or as tax laws may
otherwise allow. The substantial increase in BankAtlantic&#146;s provision for loan losses for 2008
compared to 2007 reflects net charge-offs for 2008 of $97.4&nbsp;million compared to $20.4&nbsp;million for
2007 and a $31.6&nbsp;million increase in the allowance for loan losses during 2008. The charge-offs
and loan reserve increases were primarily related to commercial real estate and home equity loans.
These categories of loans have been highly susceptible to declining real estate values in Florida
where the collateral for the loans are located. The decline in BankAtlantic&#146;s non-interest income
was primarily due to lower net assessments of overdraft fees. BankAtlantic non-interest expenses,
excluding the goodwill impairment charge, declined by $31.6&nbsp;million. During 2008, in response to
an adverse economic conditions, we slowed BankAtlantic&#146;s store expansion program, consolidated
certain back-office facilities, sold five central Florida stores, renegotiated vendor contracts,
continued staff reductions, out-sourced certain back-office functions and initiated targeted other
expense reduction programs.

(BankAtlantic Bancorp)</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant decline in BankAtlantic&#146;s earnings during 2007 reflects $70.8&nbsp;million of
provision for loan losses and $20.9&nbsp;million of restructuring charges and long-lived asset
impairments. The allowance for loan losses during 2007 was significantly increased in response to
the rapid deterioration in the Florida residential real estate market and the associated rapid and
substantial increase in non-performing loans and classified assets. Restructuring charges in 2007
related to management&#146;s decision to slow BankAtlantic&#146;s retail network expansion, consolidate its
call center operations, and sell properties or terminate operating leases acquired for store
expansion. Other factors contributing to the 2007 loss were net interest margin compression and
costs associated with opening new stores. BankAtlantic&#146;s 2007 net interest income declined by
$20.1&nbsp;million from 2006 reflecting an increase in its cost of funds due to growth in higher cost
deposit products and lower yields on earning assets due to a change in the mix of loan products and
increased nonperforming assets. BankAtlantic opened 15 new stores during 2007 and 13 new stores
during 2006. The opening and operating costs of these new stores exceeded revenues of these stores
during the 2007 period, which had a negative impact on earnings. BankAtlantic&#146;s results during
2007 compared to the same 2006 period were favorably impacted by lower advertising costs of $15.0
million and higher retail banking service fees of $13.6&nbsp;million. During the fourth quarter of 2006,
management decided to reduce advertising expenditures in response to reduced deposit growth. The
additional service fees primarily resulted from higher overdraft, interchange and surcharge income
from increased volume of customer transactions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the Parent Company segment loss during 2008 compared to 2007 reflects a
provision for loan losses of $24.4&nbsp;million associated with non-performing loans which were
transferred from BankAtlantic to the Parent Company&#146;s asset workout subsidiary in March&nbsp;2008 as
well as the establishment of a $20.9&nbsp;million deferred tax valuation allowance. The Parent Company
had no provision for loan losses during the comparable 2007 period as it held no loans during that
period. Additionally, gains from securities activities declined from $6.1&nbsp;million during 2007 to a
loss of $0.4&nbsp;million during 2008 as the Parent Company liquidated its managed fund investment
portfolio and sold its entire investment in Stifel securities acquired by it in connection with the
2007 sale of Ryan Beck. Parent Company operating expenses were higher by $4.5&nbsp;million during 2008
compared to 2007. The increase reflects property management costs associated with non-performing
loans and an increase in professional fees in 2008 compared to 2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher Parent Company net loss during 2007 compared to 2006 resulted from a $3.3&nbsp;million
other-than-temporary impairment charge associated with a private limited partnership and higher net
interest expense due to the issuance of $30.9&nbsp;million of junior subordinated debentures. The
Parent Company did not recognize impairment charges during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. Parent
Company segment operations were favorably impacted by a significant reduction of performance based
bonuses during 2007 compared to 2006 reflecting the decline in the Company&#146;s operating results for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, the Parent Company recognized in discontinued operations $16.6&nbsp;million of
additional proceeds from the Ryan Beck contingent earn-out payments under the Ryan Beck merger
agreement with Stifel. Included in discontinued operations during 2007 relating to the Ryan Beck
segment was income of $7.8&nbsp;million compared to a loss of $11.5&nbsp;million during 2006. Ryan Beck&#146;s
2007 income reflects a $16.4&nbsp;million gain from the sale of Ryan Beck to Stifel partially offset by
an $8.6&nbsp;million loss from operations during the two months ended February&nbsp;28, 2007, the closing
date of the sale to Stifel. Ryan Beck&#146;s 2006 loss resulted from declining retail brokerage
revenues and a significant slow-down in investment banking activities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following events over the past several years have had a significant impact on
BankAtlantic&#146;s business strategies and results of operations:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2002, BankAtlantic launched its &#147;<I>Florida&#146;s Most Convenient Bank&#148; </I>initiative which
resulted in significant demand deposit, NOW checking and savings account growth (we refer to these
accounts as &#147;core deposit&#148; accounts). Since inception of this campaign, BankAtlantic has
increased core deposit balances 284% from $600&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2001 to approximately $2.2
billion at December&nbsp;31, 2008. These core deposits represented 55% of BankAtlantic&#146;s total
deposits at December&nbsp;31, 2008, compared to 26% of total deposits at December&nbsp;31, 2001.

<DIV align="right" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Financial Services<BR>
(BankAtlantic Bancorp)</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, BankAtlantic announced its de novo store expansion strategy and had opened 32 stores
as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 in connection with this strategy. BankAtlantic&#146;s non-interest expenses
substantially increased as a result of this strategy reflecting the hiring of additional
personnel, increased marketing to support new stores, increased leasing and operating costs for
the new stores and expenditures for back-office technologies to support a larger institution.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2005, the growth in core deposits slowed reflecting rising
short-term interest rates and increased competition among financial institutions. In response to
these market conditions, BankAtlantic significantly increased its marketing expenditures and
continued its new store expansion program in an effort to sustain core deposit growth. The number
of new core deposit accounts opened increased from 226,000 during 2005 to 270,000 during 2006,
while core deposit balances grew to $2.2&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2006 from $2.1&nbsp;billion at
December&nbsp;31, 2005. In response to adverse economic conditions and the slowed deposit growth,
BankAtlantic significantly reduced its marketing expenditures beginning during the fourth quarter
of 2006 as part of an overall effort to reduce its non-interest expenses.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the latter half of 2007, the real estate markets deteriorated rapidly throughout the
United States, and particularly in Florida where BankAtlantic&#146;s commercial and consumer real
estate loans are concentrated. In response to these market conditions, BankAtlantic established a
significant allowance for loan losses for commercial loans collateralized by residential real
estate property and to a lesser extent home equity consumer loans.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2007, management decided to slow BankAtlantic&#146;s retail network
expansion and consolidate certain back-office facilities in order to reduce the growth of
non-interest expenses.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As economic conditions deteriorated in the latter half of 2007 and during 2008, real estate
property values continued to decline. The adverse economic and real estate market conditions
severely impacted the credit quality of BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolio. In March&nbsp;2008, the Parent
Company purchased $101.5&nbsp;million of non-performing loans from BankAtlantic and during the year
contributed $65&nbsp;million of capital to BankAtlantic. During the fourth quarter of 2008, financial
and credit markets deteriorated rapidly, investor confidence in financial institutions was
significantly and adversely affected and the market capitalization of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class
A common stock declined materially. As BankAtlantic&#146;s non-performing loans escalated, additional
loan loss reserves were established, impairments of long-lived assets were recognized and earnings
were adversely affected. As a consequence of the substantial losses during 2007 and 2008, the
deterioration in the price of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock and the unprecedented economic
and market uncertainty, BankAtlantic recognized a $48.3&nbsp;million non-cash goodwill impairment
charge and established a $66.9&nbsp;million non-cash deferred tax valuation allowance.

<DIV align="right" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Financial Services<BR>
(BankAtlantic Bancorp)</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in the tax equivalent net interest margin primarily resulted from a decline in
average non-interest bearing demand deposit balances partially offset by an improvement in the tax
equivalent net interest spread. The increase in the tax equivalent net interest spread primarily
resulted from rates on interest-bearing liabilities adjusting to the decline in short-term interest
rates faster than interest-earning asset yields. The majority of our loans adjust to LIBOR or
prime interest rates indices. The average prime interest rate declined from 8.03% during
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 to 5.08% during the 2008&nbsp;year and the average three-month
LIBOR rate declined from 5.04% during the 2007&nbsp;year to 2.92% during the 2008&nbsp;year. The majority of
interest-bearing liabilities adjust to current market rates faster than a significant portion of
our assets, which includes residential loans and mortgage-backed securities that only adjust
periodically to current market rates. The additional net interest income associated with the
improvement of the net interest spread was partially offset by average interest bearing liabilities
increasing while average interest-earning assets declined. Average interest earning assets were
$79.0&nbsp;million lower, and while overall average interest-bearing liabilities were up $53.7&nbsp;million,
non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts were $117.5&nbsp;million lower. The decline in average
non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts reflects the competitive banking environment in
Florida and the migration of demand deposit accounts to interest-bearing NOW accounts.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest income on earning assets declined $63.0&nbsp;million during 2008 as compared to 2007. The
decline was primarily due to the impact that lower interest rates during 2008 had on our average
yields for consumer, commercial and small business loans. Residential loan yields during 2008
remained at 2007 levels as the majority of our residential loans do not adjust annually and
prepayment speeds slowed, in part we believe, due to borrowers&#146; inability to refinance existing
loans at the current lower interest rates. The decline in taxable securities yields mainly
resulted from the liquidation of our tax exempt securities portfolio during the fourth quarter of
2007 and suspension by the FHLB of its stock dividend during the third quarter of 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the slowing economy and declining real estate market, we have slowed the
origination of commercial real estate loans and the purchase of residential loans. As a
consequence, average balances in our residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios
declined from $3.6&nbsp;billion during 2007 to $3.3&nbsp;billion during 2008. These declines in loan
balances were partially offset by an increase in our taxable securities, small business loan and
consumer home equity loan average balances. Aggregate average balances in our consumer home equity
and small business loan portfolios increased due primarily to fundings on existing lines of credit
for home equity loans and from the origination of small business loans. In response to the current
economic environment, BankAtlantic continues to adhere to stringent underwriting criteria and
anticipates lower growth in subsequent periods. The higher average taxable securities balances
reflect a $57.5&nbsp;million increase in tax certificate average balances as 2008 tax certificate
acquisitions were higher than 2007 acquisitions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in deposit rates primarily resulted from the lower interest rate environment
during 2008 compared to 2007. The decline in interest rates generally was offset in part by a
shift in deposit mix from demand deposit accounts to NOW accounts and from savings to certificate
accounts. The decline in savings account average balances reflects outflows of high yield savings
accounts as certain competitors offered higher interest rates. The migration from demand deposit
accounts to NOW accounts primarily resulted from a high yield checking account that we promoted
during 2008. The increase in certificates accounts reflects higher average brokered deposit
account balances as well as high yield certificate account promotions during 2008. Brokered
deposits increased from $14.7&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2007 to $239.9&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rates on wholesale borrowings during 2008 were significantly lower than 2007 reflecting a
significant decline in the federal funds rates during 2008. The average federal funds rate
declined from 5.04% during 2007 to 2.09% during 2008. Additionally, we were able to borrow at
historically low interest rates due to programs implemented by the Treasury to stimulate the
economy through increased fundings to financial institutions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to improve the net interest margin and lower borrowing costs in subsequent periods,
BankAtlantic prepaid $692&nbsp;million of FHLB advances during the fourth quarter of 2008. BankAtlantic
funded the advance repayments with short term borrowings that were at significantly lower interest
rates than the repaid advances. Management believes the current historically low interest rates
may have a favorable impact on BankAtlantic&#146;s net interest margin; however, increased competition
among financial institutions in our markets and general unfavorable economic conditions, among
other factors, could offset any declines in wholesale borrowing rates.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in tax equivalent net interest income primarily resulted from a 42 basis point
decline in the net interest margin and secondarily from higher interest-bearing liabilities
partially offset by a slight increase in interest-earning assets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant decline in tax equivalent net interest margin reflects slowed core deposit
growth, higher rates on deposit accounts and wholesale borrowings as well as lower loan yields
during 2007 compared with 2006.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in deposit rates primarily resulted from competition in our markets for deposits
which affected both our deposit pricing and deposit mix. Our deposit mix shifted unfavorably from
lower cost demand and checking accounts to higher rate deposit products, and we experienced a
gradual increase in certificate of deposit and money market rates resulting from the increasingly
competitive markets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rates on wholesale borrowings during 2007 were higher than 2006 reflecting an inverted yield
curve during the majority of 2007 and elevated federal funds borrowing rates during the third
quarter of 2007 associated with the effect that the sub-prime liquidity crisis had on capital
markets and interest rates. The Federal Reserve began reducing short term interest rates in
September&nbsp;2007 resulting in lower wholesale borrowings costs during the fourth quarter of 2007
compared to the same 2006 period.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in loan yields reflects a change in the loan product mix to lower yielding
residential loans from higher yielding commercial real estate loans as well as a significant
increase in non-accrual commercial real estate loans. Non-accrual commercial loans increased to
$165.8&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2007 from zero at December&nbsp;31, 2006. Additionally, yields on
consumer and small business loans were lower during the 2007 period primarily resulting from more
recent originations at lower yields than the average yields of the portfolio.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s average interest earning assets increased primarily as a result of higher
average loan balances. The increase in average loan balances was due to purchases of residential
loans and the origination of home equity and small business loans to retail banking customers.
These increases in average loan balances were partially offset by declines in average commercial
real estate loan balances primarily resulting from lower loan originations due to the down-turn in
the Florida real estate market.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in tax equivalent net interest income during 2008 was largely due to yields on
interest earning assets declining faster than interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities. The
lower yields on total earning assets reduced interest income by $77.5&nbsp;million while declines in
interest rates on total interest bearing liabilities reduced interest expense by $54.1&nbsp;million. As
discussed above, the lower yields on interest earning assets reflect the effect on our loan
portfolio interest income of the significant decline during 2008 of LIBOR and prime interest rate
indices. The decline in federal funds rates and the programs implemented by the Treasury to
promote lending by financial institutions significantly lowered wholesale borrowing interest rates.
However, our deposits interest rate declines were less than our earning asset yield declines as
interest rates on our low cost deposits are not as sensitive to interest rate changes as our loan
portfolio rates and competition from other financial institutions resulted in only a gradual
decline in certificate account interest rates.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic experienced increases in both interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities during 2007. The higher interest-earnings assets increased the tax equivalent interest
income by $5.9&nbsp;million which was more than offset by the increase in interest-bearing liabilities
which increased interest expense by $6.6&nbsp;million. The decrease in interest-earning asset yields
reduced interest income by $2.6&nbsp;million while the higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities
increased interest expense by $17.2&nbsp;million. As discussed above, the lower loan yields primarily
reflect a change in the mix of loans from higher yielding loan products to lower yielding
residential loans and the increase in deposit and borrowing rates were primarily due to competitive
pricing in our markets, a change in the mix of deposits and higher short term borrowing rates
during 2007 compared to 2006. The combination of increased cost of funds due to external factors
and lower yields on interest-earnings assets due to declining average balances on higher yielding
loan products had a significant unfavorable effect on our net interest income.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant increase in the provision for loan losses for 2007 and 2008 compared to the
prior periods resulted primarily from the rapid decline in real estate values nationally and in
Florida, the substantial downturn in the homebuilding industry and the deteriorating economic
environment during the end of 2007 and throughout 2008. BankAtlantic has a high concentration of
commercial borrowers in the homebuilding industry and the majority of its residential and consumer
home equity loans are to retail customers. The ability of these retail customers to repay
their loans is adversely affected by rising unemployment rates. These declines in the value
of real estate, which initially involved primarily residential real estate but is now being
experienced in the commercial non-residential real estate markets, have exacerbated our credit
losses as the underlying collateral values of our loans have continued to decline throughout 2007
and 2008. BankAtlantic&#146;s commercial borrowers are experiencing difficulties selling real estate
inventory or maintaining current cash flow levels on rental real estate properties. Also,
BankAtlantic&#146;s home equity and residential loan customers are facing challenges when attempting to
sell or refinance their homes. In response to these trends, we have slowed down the purchase of
residential loans and tightened consumer home equity loan underwriting requirements for new loans
and froze certain borrowers&#146; home equity loan commitments where borrowers&#146; current credit scores
were significantly lower than at the date of loan origination or where current collateral values
were substantially lower than at loan origination. Additionally, our non-performing loans and loan
delinquencies trends have steadily worsened throughout 2008 resulting in higher allowances for loan
losses for all loan products. We believe that if real estate market conditions and the economy in
general do not stabilize in Florida and nationally, we would expect an increase in loan
delinquencies and non-accrual loan balances as well as additional provisions for loan losses in
future periods.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in provision for loan losses during 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily the
result of unfavorable trends in our commercial residential development, consumer home equity and
small business loan portfolios as well as significant charge-offs in our commercial real estate and
consumer home equity loan portfolios. As a consequence, we increased the allowance for loan losses
for all loan products during 2008. The majority of the commercial loan charge-offs were associated
with commercial residential development loans; however, during the latter half of 2008 we began
incurring charge-offs and establishing specific reserves on commercial loans collateralized by
office buildings and retail shopping centers. Also during 2008 we incurred substantial charge-offs
in our home equity loan portfolio as the current economic recession has eroded our borrowers&#146;
ability to service the loans and the collateral values have continued to decline throughout 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the provision for loan losses during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily resulted
from the rapid deterioration in the Florida real estate market and the associated rapid increase in
non-performing loans. The $70.8&nbsp;million provision for loan losses for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2007 includes certain specific reserves associated with commercial residential development loans
placed on non-accrual during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. These loans were all collateral
dependent and the specific reserve was established by estimating the fair value of the collateral
less cost to sell. The remaining increase in the provision for loan losses during 2007 primarily
resulted from an increase in the allowance for loan losses associated with the commercial
residential development loan portfolio and to a lesser extent the consumer home equity loan
portfolio.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During prior periods we discontinued the origination of syndication, lease financings and
indirect consumer loans and made major modifications to the underwriting process for small business
loans (collectively, &#147;discontinued loan products&#148;.) We experienced net recoveries from
discontinued loan products for each of the years in the five year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2008.
These discontinued loan products resulted in significant losses in periods prior to 2003. As a
result of this experience we changed our credit policies to focus our loan production on collateral
based loans.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial real estate loans account for a large portion of the allowance for loan losses for
each of the years in the five year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. The commercial real estate loan
allowance from December&nbsp;31, 2004 through December&nbsp;2005 primarily reflected allowance for loan
losses based on increases or decreases in high balance loans. The increase in the allowance for
commercial real estate loans during 2006 was associated with a slow-down in the homebuilding
industry. The substantial increase in the commercial real estate allowance for loan losses during
2007 and 2008 resulted in large part from a rapid deterioration in the Florida real estate market,
generally, and the significant downturn in the residential real estate market. During 2008 and
2007, home sales and median home prices declined significantly on a year-over-year basis in all
major metropolitan areas in Florida, with conditions deteriorating rapidly during the fourth
quarter of 2008 in response to the overall loss of confidence in the financial markets. The
housing industry is experiencing its worst downturn in 17&nbsp;years and market conditions in the
housing industry have continued to worsen throughout 2008 and into 2009 reflecting, in part,
decreased availability of mortgage financing for residential home buyers, reduced demand for new
construction resulting in a significant over-supply of housing inventory, and increased foreclosure
rates. Additionally, the allowance for loan losses was also increased to reflect higher estimated
inherit losses in our commercial non-residential loan portfolio as the current economic recession
and credit market instability have contributed to higher non-performing loans in this loan product.
These loans have performed better during 2007 and 2008 than commercial residential development
loans as the underlying collateral associated with these loans are generally income producing.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">economic conditions do not improve, there is no assurance that we will not experience
delinquencies and charge-offs in our commercial non-residential loan portfolio comparable to the
levels experienced during 2007 and 2008 in our commercial residential development loan portfolios.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three categories of loans in our commercial residential development loan portfolio
that have resulted in the majority of the increase in our commercial real estate allowance for loan
losses. The loan balance in these categories aggregated $303.7 at December&nbsp;31, 2008. These
categories are as follows:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &#147;builder land bank loan&#148; category consists of 7 loans and aggregates $62.4&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2008. This category consists of land loans to borrowers who have or had land purchase
option agreements with regional and/or national builders. These loans were originally underwritten
based on projected sales of the developed lots to the builders/option holders, and timely repayment
of the loans is primarily dependent upon the sale of the property pursuant to the options. If the
lots are not sold as originally anticipated, BankAtlantic anticipates that the borrower may not be
in a position to service the loan, with the likely result being an increase in nonperforming loans
and loan losses in this category. The number of homebuilders who have publicly announced that
they are, or are contemplating, terminating these options or seeking bankruptcy protection
substantially increases the risk that the lots will not be acquired as contemplated. Four loans in
this category totaling $40.4&nbsp;million were on non-accrual at December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &#147;land acquisition and development loan&#148; category consists of 25 loans and aggregates
$165.8&nbsp;million and generally consists of loans secured by residential land which is intended to be
developed by the borrower and sold to homebuilders. These loans are generally underwritten more
stringently than builder land bank loans, as an option agreement with a regional or national
builder did not exist at the origination date. Three loans in this category totaling $33.2&nbsp;million
were on non-accrual at December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &#147;land acquisition, development and construction loan&#148; category consists of 14 loans and
aggregates $75.5&nbsp;million. This category generally consists of loans secured by residential land
which will be fully developed by the borrower who may also construct homes on the property. These
loans generally involve property with a longer investment and development horizon, are guaranteed
by the borrower or individuals and/or are secured by additional collateral or equity such that it
is expected that the borrower will have the ability to service the debt for a longer period of
time. Three loans in this category totaling $18.5&nbsp;million were on non-accrual at December&nbsp;31,
2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance for consumer loans has increased for each of the years in the five year period
ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. This increase during 2004 through 2006 was largely associated with the
growth in outstanding home equity loans throughout the period and the change in policy during 2004
to permit higher loan-to-value ratio loans based on Beacon scores. The significant increase in the
consumer loan portfolio allowance for loan losses during 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to
a significant increase in consumer home equity loan charge-offs, higher non-performing loans and
adverse delinquency trends. Residential property values in Florida have significantly declined and
the State unemployment rate in Florida has almost doubled from 4.5% at December&nbsp;31, 2007 to 8.1% at
December&nbsp;31, 2008. The increased unemployment rate has resulted in adverse delinquency trends and
declining property values resulted in higher credit losses and an increased allowance for loan
losses.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the allowance for loan losses for consumer loans during 2007 compared to 2006
reflects unfavorable home equity loan delinquency trends, higher non-performing home equity loans
and a significant increase in charge-offs during the fourth quarter of 2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance for residential loan losses increased during 2006 compared to 2005 and 2004
primarily associated with higher loan balances. During 2007 the allowance was maintained at 2006
levels as the portfolio experienced minimal credit losses and no adverse delinquency trends.
During 2008, as property values nationwide plummeted and unemployment rates increased, our
residential loan portfolio began experiencing unfavorable delinquency trends and increased
charge-offs. As a consequence of these adverse trends the residential allowance for loan losses
increased by 44% during 2008 compared to 2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance for small business loan losses increased during 2006 compared to 2005 and 2004
primarily associated with higher loan balances. During 2007 the allowance was maintained at 2006
levels as delinquency

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-performing assets were substantially higher at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007 compared to the
prior three years. The large increase reflects higher non-accrual assets. The increase in
non-performing assets during 2006 compared to 2005 and 2004 resulted from a repossessed commercial
real estate property during 2006. The property was further impaired by $7.2&nbsp;million during 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in non-accrual assets at December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared to December&nbsp;2007 primarily
resulted from higher non-accrual loan balances for residential, consumer-home equity and small
business loans. The increase in residential non-accrual loans reflects the general deterioration
in the national economy and the residential real estate market as home prices throughout the
country continued to decline and it is taking longer than historical time-frames to foreclose on
and sell homes.

BankAtlantic moved $203.6&nbsp;million of loans to non-accrual, offset by $101.5&nbsp;million of non-accrual
loans transferred to a work-out subsidiary of the Parent Company as well as charge-offs and loan
repayments during 2008. These loans were mainly commercial residential development loans
identified in the high exposure loan categories.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial increase in non-accrual assets at December&nbsp;31, 2007 compared to the three
prior year periods primarily resulted from placing $151.0&nbsp;million of commercial residential
development loans on non-accrual during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. Consumer home equity and
residential non-accrual loan balances also increased compared to prior periods.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, BankAtlantic modified the terms of certain
commercial loans in a &#147;troubled debt restructuring&#148; based on the financial difficulties of the
borrowers. The original terms were modified to reduce the cash payments in order to lessen the near
term cash requirements of the borrowers&#146; obligations. While there is no assurance this will be the
case, BankAtlantic currently expects to collect all principal and interest on these loans based on
the modified loan terms.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in Item&nbsp;1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, in the
event of a sustained decline in real estate markets, and residential real estate in particular, and
a slowdown in the economy in general, we may experience further deterioration in the credit
quality/performance of our loan portfolio. As a consequence, if conditions do not improve, the
residential real estate market declines further, or commercial non-residential real estate markets
decline, we will experience an increasing amount of non-performing assets.

due to lower overdraft fee income. This decline in overdraft fees primarily resulted from lower
net overdraft assessments and more stringent criteria for allowing customer overdrafts in response
to increasing check losses. Also contributing to reduce fee income was a decline in new deposit
account openings resulting, in part, from a management decision to reduce overall marketing and
advertising expenses and the competitive deposit gathering environment. BankAtlantic has
implemented an overdraft fee increase effective March&nbsp;1, 2009 to cover increasing costs of
processing and collecting overdrafts.

cruise ships was offset by lower debit card transaction volume. Also, the decline in the number

anticipate that the transaction volume may continue to decline if current economic conditions do

to higher interchange and surcharge income associated with an increased volume of customer
transactions. The increase in service card fees during 2007 was partially offset by the
elimination of check card annual fees as of January&nbsp;1, 2007 in response to competitive market
conditions. The higher interchange volume reflects a substantial increase in the number of debit
cards issued associated with the opening of new accounts.

and realized gains of $0.9&nbsp;million. The agency securities were sold to increase the average

gains from the sales of MasterCard International stock. This gain was partially offset by $1.6
million of realized losses from the sale of $399.2&nbsp;million of municipal securities and $105.8
million of agency securities available for sale. The municipal securities were sold because the
lower tax-free returns on these securities were not beneficial to the Company in light of the
losses incurred during 2007 and the agency securities were sold in response to changes in market
interest rates and related changes in the securities&#146; prepayment risk.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gains associated with debt redemption for 2006 were the result of gains realized on the
prepayment of FHLB advances. BankAtlantic prepaid these advances as part of a strategy to reduce
the net effect of an asset sensitive portfolio on its net interest margin by shortening the average
maturity of its outstanding interest-bearing liabilities.

of stores and the consolidation of back-office facilities. Gain on sale of bank facilities during
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 primarily resulted from an exchange of branch facilities with
another financial institution. The financial institution had a surplus branch facility from a
recent acquisition and BankAtlantic was searching for a suitable branch site in that general
location. As consideration for this surplus branch, BankAtlantic exchanged a branch with the
financial institution and recorded a $1.8&nbsp;million gain equal to the appraised value of the branch
transferred less its carrying value.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s non-interest expense for 2008, excluding $59.6&nbsp;million of impairments,
restructuring charges and costs associated with debt redemptions, was $271.1&nbsp;million compared to
$293.0&nbsp;million and $292.0&nbsp;million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2008, in response to
the adverse economic environment, we delayed our store expansion program, consolidated certain
back-office facilities, sold five central Florida stores, renegotiated vendor contracts, continued
staff reductions, out-sourced certain back-office functions and initiated targeted expense
reduction programs. Management&#146;s focus on reducing expenses and increasing operating efficiencies
is on-going and BankAtlantic anticipates further expense reductions during 2009. Management is
continuing to explore opportunities to reduce operating expenses and increase future operating
efficiencies; however, there is no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial decline in employee compensation and benefits during the year ended December
31, 2008 compared to the same 2007 period resulted primarily from workforce reductions in March
2007 and April&nbsp;2008, attrition as well as declines in personnel related to the implementation in
December&nbsp;2007 of reduced store lobby and call center hours. In March&nbsp;2007, BankAtlantic reduced
its work force by 225 associates, or 8%, and in April&nbsp;2008 BankAtlantic&#146;s work force was further
reduced by 124 associates, or 6%. As a consequence of the work force reductions and normal
attrition, the number of full-time equivalent employees declined from 2,618 at December&nbsp;31, 2006
to 1,770 at December&nbsp;31, 2008, or 32%, while the store network expanded from 88 stores at December
31, 2006 to 101 stores at December&nbsp;31, 2008. Performance bonuses during 2008 were $3.6&nbsp;million
lower than in 2007 reflecting lower loan originations and deposit growth. Share-based
compensation expense was also lower for 2008 compared to 2007. The Company did not grant share
based awards during 2008 and reversed prior period share based compensation expense as the
forfeiture rate on outstanding options was increased from 18% to 40% reflecting the significant
reduction in the workforce during 2008.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee compensation and benefits expenses for 2007 increased slightly from 2006. This
increase was due to the additional employees associated with the opening of 15 stores during 2007
and the opening of 13 stores throughout 2006. These increases in compensation expenses were
partially offset by reductions of performance bonuses in 2007 and the March&nbsp;2007 workforce reductions. Performance bonuses were $4.3
million lower during 2007 compared to 2006, resulting in part from the elimination of executive
management cash bonuses. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, the number of full-time
equivalent BankAtlantic employees declined from 2,618 at December&nbsp;31, 2006 to 2,385 at December
31, 2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occupancy and equipment expenses for 2008 declined slightly from 2007. During the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic consolidated two call center operations into one call center in
Orlando, Florida, sold five central Florida stores to an unrelated financial institution,
terminated certain back-office lease agreements in consolidating back-office operations and
renegotiated various vendor contracts. The above expense reduction actions were partially offset
by higher depreciation and real estate tax expenses associated with the 2007 store network
expansion initiatives.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant increase in occupancy and equipment during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily
resulted from the expansion of the store network and back-office facilities to support a larger
organization. BankAtlantic entered into various operating lease agreements relating to current and
future store expansion as well as for back-office facilities. BankAtlantic also incurred higher
operating costs for real estate taxes, guard services, and utilities associated with the above
growth and expansion initiatives.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consequence of slowing new account growth and a changing economic environment, management
decided during the fourth quarter of 2006 to reduce advertising expenses. Reflecting that decision,
advertising expenses during 2008 and 2007 were significantly lower than 2006. The decline in
advertising expenses for 2008 compared to 2007 primarily resulted from lower promotional costs for
store grand openings and a management decision to reduce overall marketing as part of an expense
reduction initiative. BankAtlantic opened 15 stores during 2007 and 3 during 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic experienced an increase in check losses from 2006 to 2007. The higher check
losses during 2007 were primarily related to significant increase in the volume of checking
account overdrafts relating to the increased number of checking accounts and the slowing economy.
Stringent overdraft policies were implemented, coupled with a decline in new account growth,
resulting in lower check losses during 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher professional fees for 2008 compared to 2007 primarily resulted from increased
litigation costs and legal fees as well as higher supervisory and examination fees. The litigation
cost was associated with our tax certificate activities while the higher legal fees were mainly
associated with loan foreclosure actions and class action lawsuits. Management believes that the
current economic environment as well as the above lawsuits may result in continued elevated legal
costs in subsequent periods. The supervisory and exam fees related to increased consulting fees in
connection with a review of our commercial loan portfolio and regulatory compliance.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in professional fees during 2007 compared to 2006 reflects higher litigation
reserves and legal fees associated with loan work-outs and pending litigation relating to
commercial residential real estate loans and the tax certificate portfolio.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in supplies and postage during each of the years in the three year period ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008 reflects overall expense reduction initiatives and the conversion of certain
deposit customers to electronic bank statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower telecommunication costs for 2008 compared to 2007 primarily resulted from switching
to a new vendor on more favorable terms. The increase in telecommunication expenses for 2007
compared to 2006 was directly related to BankAtlantic&#146;s growth initiatives and store expansion.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amortization of intangible assets consisted of the amortization of acquired core deposit
intangible assets, which are being amortized over an estimated life of ten years.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs associated with debt redemptions were the result of prepayment penalties incurred
upon the prepayment of FHLB advances in 2008 and 2006. The prepayments in 2008 were part of an
initiative to improve our net interest margin as current short term borrowing interest rates are
at historical lows. The prepayments during 2006 were part of a market risk strategy to reduce the effect of an asset sensitive portfolio
on BankAtlantic&#146;s net interest margin by shortening the average maturity of its outstanding
interest-bearing liabilities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant increase in the provision for tax certificates losses during 2008 compared to
2007 and 2006 reflects higher charge-offs and increases in the allowance for tax certificate
losses for certificates acquired through bulk purchases in distressed Midwestern States. We
ceased the bulk acquisition of tax certificates and our out-of-state tax certificate portfolio was
reduced through redemptions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restructuring charges, impairments and exit activities during 2008 reflect a $2.2&nbsp;million
severance charge in connection with the April&nbsp;2008 workforce reduction, and $5.0&nbsp;million of asset
impairments and lease obligation costs associated with management&#146;s plan to sell properties or
terminate leases associated with our decision to suspend the store expansion initiative. Also
included in restructuring charges is a $0.3&nbsp;million loss on the sale of five central Florida stores
to an unrelated financial institution.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restructuring charges, impairments and exit activities during 2007 reflect the March&nbsp;2007
workforce reduction and impairment and lease obligation costs associated with our decision to
suspend the store expansion initiative.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, BankAtlantic recognized impairment charges
on a real estate development acquired in connection with the acquisition of a financial
institution during 2002. The development was written down to fair value based on updated
indications of value. During 2008, BankAtlantic sold all vertical construction associated with
the development and the remaining real estate inventory consists of developed and undeveloped
lots.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impairment of real estate owned during 2008 was primarily associated with properties acquired
through tax certificate activities in distressed areas of the country. Real estate owned
impairments during 2007 primarily resulted from a $7.2&nbsp;million write-down associated with a real
estate development acquired when BankAtlantic took possession of the collateral securing a land
acquisition and development loan during the fourth quarter of 2006.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company tests goodwill for potential impairment annually or during interim periods if
impairment indicators exist. Based on the results of its impairment evaluation, the Company
recorded an impairment charge of $48.3&nbsp;million in 2008. All goodwill in the amount of $31.0
million and $17.3&nbsp;million, respectively, relating to the Company&#146;s commercial lending and community
banking reporting units was determined to be impaired. However, goodwill associated with the
Company&#146;s capital services, tax certificates and investment reporting units of $13.1&nbsp;million, $4.7
million and $4.4&nbsp;million, respectively, was determined to not be impaired. The impairments in our
community banking and commercial lending business units reflect the on-going downward trends in the
financial services industry affecting the Company&#146;s market capitalization and the credit quality of
BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolios. BankAtlantic may recognize additional goodwill impairment charges
of up to $22.2&nbsp;million in subsequent periods if economic conditions do not improve.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher other expenses during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily resulted from a $2.3&nbsp;million
increase in BankAtlantic&#146;s deposit premium assessments as the credit held by BankAtlantic against
its deposit premium assessments relating back to the early 1990&#146;s was exhausted and BankAtlantic
began paying the full deposit premium during the second quarter of 2008. BankAtlantic anticipates
its deposit assessment premium to significantly increase during 2009 as the FDIC has adopted a
restoration plan that will increase the rates banks pay for deposit insurance. BankAtlantic also
incurred $3.3&nbsp;million of increased property maintenance costs associated with real estate owned and
non-performing loans. These increases in other expenses were partially offset by lower general
operating expenses directly related to management&#146;s expense reduction initiatives.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher other expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 compared to the same 2006
period reflect higher shared services allocations from BFC for human resources and risk management
services as well as increased insurance costs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between the effective tax rate and the expected federal income tax rate of 35%
during 2008 was primarily due to the disallowance of tax benefits associated with the current year
losses and net deferred tax assets as a result of the establishment of a deferred tax valuation
allowance. Due to BankAtlantic&#146;s recent history of losses and the significant ongoing
deterioration in economic conditions, BankAtlantic recorded a $66.9&nbsp;million deferred tax asset
valuation allowance representing the entire amount of its net deferred tax assets as of December
31, 2008.

and 2006 was primarily due to tax exempt income from municipal securities and benefits for state

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest and dividend income on investments during each of the years in the three year period
ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 was primarily interest and dividends associated with a portfolio of debt
and equity securities managed by a money manager as well as earnings from a reverse repurchase
account with BankAtlantic. Earnings from the BankAtlantic reverse repurchase account were $0.2
million, $0.3&nbsp;million and $0.2&nbsp;million during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The significant decline in interest and dividends on investments during 2008
resulted from the liquidation of the $54.2&nbsp;million managed investment portfolio during the first
quarter of 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest expense for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 consisted primarily of
debt service on the Company&#146;s junior subordinated debentures. The decline in interest expense
during 2008 compared to 2007 resulted from lower average interest rates in 2008 partially offset by
higher average borrowings. Average rates on junior subordinated debentures decreased from 8.29%
during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 to 7.14% during the same 2008 period as a result of lower
short-term interest rates during 2008 compared to 2007. As previously discussed, the Company
elected during the first quarter of 2009 to defer the payment of interest on all of its junior
subordinated debentures, and may continue to defer interest payments for up to 20 consecutive
quarterly periods. During the deferral period, interest will continue to accrue on the debentures
and on the accrued interest, and the Company will continue to recognize such deferred interest as
interest expense in its financial statements. The Company&#146;s junior subordinated debentures average
balances were $294.2&nbsp;million during 2008 compared to $277.9&nbsp;million during the same 2007 period.
The increase in interest expense during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily resulted from the issuance
of $25.8&nbsp;million and $5.1&nbsp;million of junior subordinated debentures in June&nbsp;2007 and September
2007, respectively. The average balance of junior subordinated debentures during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2006 was $263.3&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide greater flexibility in holding and managing non-performing loans and to improve
BankAtlantic&#146;s financial condition, the Parent Company formed a new asset workout subsidiary which
acquired non-performing commercial and commercial residential real estate loans from BankAtlantic
for $94.8&nbsp;million in cash on March&nbsp;31, 2008. BankAtlantic transferred $101.5&nbsp;million of
non-performing loans to the Parent Company&#146;s subsidiary at the loan&#146;s carrying value inclusive of
$6.4&nbsp;million in specific allowances for loan losses and $0.3&nbsp;million of escrow balances. The
work-out subsidiary of the Parent Company entered into a servicing arrangement with BankAtlantic
with respect to these loans.

work-out subsidiary was changed to accrual status and the Company received $1.1&nbsp;million of loan
repayments.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for loan losses during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 resulted from $19.2
million of charge-offs on non-performing loans and an increase of specific reserves of $5.2
million. These additional impairments were associated with nonperforming commercial residential
real estate loans, and were due to updated loan collateral fair value estimates reflecting the
continued deterioration in the Florida residential real estate market. As previously stated, if
market conditions do not improve in the Florida real estate market, additional provisions for loan
losses and charge-offs may be required in subsequent periods.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income from unconsolidated subsidiaries during 2008, 2007 and 2006 represents $0.6&nbsp;million,
$0.7&nbsp;million and $0.6&nbsp;million, respectively, of equity earnings from trusts formed to issue trust
preferred securities and $0, $0.6&nbsp;million, and $1.0&nbsp;million of equity earnings in income producing
real estate joint ventures during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
The business purpose of the joint ventures was to manage certain rental properties with the
intent to sell the properties in the foreseeable future. The Parent Company&#146;s joint ventures were
liquidated and the Parent Company is not currently investing in joint ventures.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, the Parent Company sold $54.2&nbsp;million of equity securities from its managed
investment portfolio, $108.4&nbsp;million of Stifel common stock and warrants to acquire 722,586 shares
of Stifel common stock for a net gain of $4.2&nbsp;million. The majority of the $181.8&nbsp;million of
proceeds from the sale of securities and warrants were used to purchase $94.5&nbsp;million of
non-performing loans from BankAtlantic and to contribute $65&nbsp;million of capital to BankAtlantic.
The Parent Company also recognized other-than-temporary impairment charges of $4.6&nbsp;million
associated with an investment in a private limited partnership and an equity investment in a
private placement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2007, the Parent Company sold $49.5&nbsp;million of equity securities from its managed
investment portfolio for gains of $9.1&nbsp;million. The majority of the proceeds from the sale of
equity securities were used to purchase and retire the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. The Parent
Company recognized $0.3&nbsp;million of unrealized gains from market appreciation of Stifel warrants and
recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $3.3&nbsp;million associated with an investment in a
private limited partnership.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Securities activities gains during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 primarily represent gains
from managed funds. During 2006, the Parent Company sold $69.1&nbsp;million of equity securities from
its portfolio for gains of $9.2&nbsp;million. The majority of the proceeds from the sale of equity
securities were reinvested in equity securities. A portion of these proceeds was also used to fund
interest expense on junior subordinated debentures.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other income during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007 represents fees charged to
BankAtlantic for executive management services. These fees are eliminated in the Company&#146;s
consolidated financial statements.

represents salaries and bonuses for executive officers of the Company as well as recruitment
expenses. The lower compensation expense during 2007 compared to 2006 and 2008 primarily reflects
the elimination of performance bonuses during 2007. Compensation expense during 2008 also included
a $0.6&nbsp;million reduction in share-based compensation as the forfeiture rate was increased from 18%
to 40% to reflect updated historical forfeiture experience. Additional compensation expense during
2006 included payroll taxes associated with the exercise of stock options. Share-based
compensation expense was $1.2&nbsp;million for each of the years in the two year period ended December
31, 2007 and $0.6&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008 the Parent Company incurred higher professional fees associated with a securities
class-action lawsuit filed against the Company and the formal investigation into the class-action
lawsuit matter by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also included in professional fees during
2008 were legal costs incurred associated with servicing the non-performing loans held in a
work-out subsidiary of the Parent Company. Professional fees during 2006 and 2007 were primarily
legal costs for general corporate matters.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in other expenses during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared to the same
periods during 2007 and 2006 reflect $2.5&nbsp;million for property maintenance costs for non-performing
loans in the process of foreclosure. The Parent Company also incurred $0.2&nbsp;million of loan
servicing fees from BankAtlantic related to the loans held by the asset workout subsidiary. Also
included in other expenses for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were fees paid to
BFC for investor relations, risk management and executive management personnel services provided to
the Company by BFC.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parent Company recognized a provision for income taxes of $1.4&nbsp;million in 2008 and an
income tax benefit of $6.2&nbsp;million and $6.0&nbsp;million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. These amounts
represent effective tax rates of 2.65%, 36.94% and 38.88% for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
The change in the Company&#146;s effective tax rate in 2008 from 2007 and 2006 was primarily due to the
disallowance of tax benefits associated with the Parent Company&#146;s current year loss as a result of
a deferred tax valuation allowance established during 2008. The Company&#146;s 2005 and 2007 Federal
income tax returns are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s principal source of liquidity is its cash and investments. The Company also may
obtain funds through dividends from its subsidiaries, issuance of equity and debt securities,
proceeds from the Ryan Beck sale contingent earn-out arrangement and liquidation of its
investments. The Company uses these funds to contribute capital to its subsidiaries, pay debt
service and shareholder dividends, repay borrowings, invest in equity securities and other
investments and fund operations. The Company&#146;s 2008 interest expense associated with its junior
subordinated debentures was approximately $21.3&nbsp;million. In order to preserve liquidity in the
current difficult economic environment, the Company elected in February&nbsp;2009 to defer interest
payments on all of its outstanding junior subordinated debentures and to cease paying dividends on
its common stock. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company received $15.0&nbsp;million of
dividends from BankAtlantic which was utilized for debt service on its junior subordinated
debentures. The ability of BankAtlantic to pay dividends or make other distributions to the
Company in subsequent periods is subject to regulations and Office of Thrift Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;)
approval and is based upon BankAtlantic&#146;s regulatory capital levels and net income. Because
BankAtlantic has an accumulated deficit during the prior two years, BankAtlantic is required to
file an application to receive approval of the OTS in order to pay dividends to the Company. The
OTS would not approve any distribution that would cause BankAtlantic to fail to meet its capital
requirements or if the OTS believes that a capital distribution by BankAtlantic constitutes an
unsafe or unsound action or practice and there is no assurance that the OTS will approve future
capital distributions from BankAtlantic. BankAtlantic has not filed an application with the OTS
for approval to pay a dividend since September&nbsp;2008 and the Company does not expect to receive cash
dividends from BankAtlantic during 2009, and possibly longer. However, the Company may receive
dividends from its asset work-out subsidiary upon the monetizing of the subsidiaries&#146;
non-performing loans. The Company&#146;s liquidity focus during 2009 is on providing capital to
BankAtlantic, if needed, managing the cash requirements of its asset work-out subsidiary, and
funding its operating expenses. The Company is required to provide BankAtlantic with managerial
assistance and capital as the OTS may determine necessary under applicable regulations and
supervisory standards.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2009, the Company elected to defer regularly scheduled interest payments on all of
the Company&#146;s outstanding junior subordinated debentures relating to its outstanding trust
preferred securities. The terms of the junior subordinated debentures and the trust documents
allow the Company to defer payments of interest for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods without
default or penalty. During the deferral period, the respective trusts will likewise suspend the
declaration and payment of dividends on the trust preferred securities. The deferral election will
begin with respect to regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments aggregating $3.9&nbsp;million that
would otherwise have been made in March and April of 2009. The Company has the ability under the
junior subordinated debentures to continue to defer interest payments through ongoing, appropriate
notices to each of the trustees, and will make a decision each quarter as to whether to continue
the deferral of interest. During the deferral period, interest will continue to accrue on the
junior subordinated debentures at the stated coupon rate, including on the deferred interest, and
the Company will continue to record the interest expense associated with the junior subordinated
debentures. During the deferral period, the Company may not, among other things and with limited
exceptions, pay cash dividends on or repurchase its common stock nor make any payment on
outstanding debt obligations that rank equally with or junior to the junior subordinated
debentures. The Company may end the deferral by paying all accrued and unpaid interest.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has the following cash and investments that provide a source for potential
liquidity based on values at December&nbsp;31, 2008; however, there is no assurance that these
investments will maintain such value or that we would receive proceeds equal to estimated fair
value upon the liquidation of these investments (see Note 31 to the &#147;Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements &#148; for a discussion of fair value measurements).

December&nbsp;31, 2008 that are a potential source of liquidity.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Parent Company sold its holdings of Stifel common
stock and warrants, liquidated its managed fund equity securities and sold private investment
securities for aggregate net proceeds of $181.9&nbsp;million. The Parent Company transferred $94.8
million of the cash proceeds from the sale of these assets to BankAtlantic in exchange for the
transfer by BankAtlantic of non-performing commercial loans to a wholly-owned asset workout
subsidiary of the Parent Company. The Parent Company may consider, among other alternatives,
selling interests in the subsidiary to investors in the future. The Parent Company also used a
portion of the proceeds from its securities sales to contribute $65&nbsp;million to BankAtlantic to
improve BankAtlantic&#146;s capital base.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stifel agreement also provides for contingent earn-out payments, payable in cash or shares
of Stifel common stock, at Stifel&#146;s election, based on (a)&nbsp;defined Ryan Beck private client
revenues during the two-year period immediately following the merger up to a maximum of $40,000,000
and (b)&nbsp;defined Ryan Beck investment banking revenues equal to 25% of the amount that such revenues
exceed $25,000,000 during each of the two twelve-month periods immediately following the merger.
The contingent earn-out payments will be accounted for when earned as additional proceeds from the
exchange of Ryan Beck common stock. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company earned
$16.6&nbsp;million in earn-out consideration pursuant to the above agreement. The Company received
$11.7&nbsp;million of this earn-out consideration during 2008 and the remaining estimated consideration
of $9.1&nbsp;million will be payable to the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Stifel agreement,
the Company agreed to indemnify Stifel against certain losses arising out of activities of Ryan
Beck prior to its sale. Stifel recently indicated that it believes the thresholds for such
obligations have been met and the Company has requested information from Stifel in order to
determine if any amounts might be owed. Based on information

in a position to provide capital to BankAtlantic, if needed, the Company is considering pursuing
the issuance of securities, which could include Class&nbsp;A common stock, debt, preferred stock,
warrants or any combination thereof. Any such financing could be obtained through public or
private offerings, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Additionally, we could
pursue these financings at the Parent Company level or directly at BankAtlantic or both. Any
financing involving the issuance of our Class&nbsp;A common stock or securities convertible or
exercisable for our Class&nbsp;A common stock could be highly dilutive for our existing shareholders.
There is no assurance that any such financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2008, the U.S. Treasury announced the Capital Purchase Program (The &#147;CPP&#148;) or to
invest capital into U.S. financial institutions pursuant to which institutions may issue senior
preferred stock to the Treasury and receive proceeds of up to 3&nbsp;percent of risk-weighted assets.
The Program requires that in conjunction with the issuance of senior preferred shares, the Treasury
will receive warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to 15&nbsp;percent
of the investment in senior preferred stock with the exercise price equal to the market price of
the participating institution&#146;s common stock at the time of approval, calculated on a 20-trading
day trailing average. Financial institutions that participate will be subject to certain
restrictions and covenants as may be required by the Treasury. The Company and BankAtlantic have
submitted an application for CPP funds; however, there is no assurance that the Company or
BankAtlantic will participate in the Treasury&#146;s Program or of the amount of any such participation.
To date, the Treasury has not acted on the application. In the event we receive approval for
participation in the CPP and choose to do so, we expect that we would end the deferral of interest
payments on our junior subordinated debentures using existing funds of the Company.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2008, the FDIC announced a Liquidity Guarantee Program. Under this program,
certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued on or before June&nbsp;30, 2009, would be fully
protected in the event the issuing institution subsequently fails, or its holding company files for
bankruptcy. This includes promissory notes, commercial paper, inter-bank funding, and any unsecured
portion of secured debt. Coverage would be limited to the period ending June&nbsp;30, 2012, even if the
maturity exceeds that date. The program may provide BankAtlantic with additional liquidity as
certain new borrowings may be guaranteed by the FDIC. The FDIC also announced that any
participating depository institution will be able to provide full deposit insurance coverage for
non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts including interest bearing accounts with rates at
or below fifty basis points, regardless of dollar amount. This new, temporary guarantee will expire
at the end of 2009. BankAtlantic &#147;opted-in&#148; to the additional coverage on qualifying borrowings
and non-interest bearing deposits. As a result, BankAtlantic may be assessed a 75-basis point fee
on new covered borrowings, and will be assessed a 10-basis point surcharge for non-interest bearing
deposit transaction balances exceeding the previously insured amount.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2008, the FDIC adopted a restoration plan that would increase the rates depository
institutions pay for deposit insurance. Under the restoration plan, the assessment rate schedule
would be raised uniformly by 7 basis points beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2009 and beginning with the
second quarter of 2009, changes would be made to

been notified of our assessment rate increase, a 7 basis point assessment rate increase would
result in $2.8&nbsp;million of additional annual FDIC assessment premiums for BankAtlantic based on
deposits as of December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s liquidity may be affected by unforeseen demands on cash. Our objective in
managing liquidity is to maintain sufficient resources of available liquid assets to address our
funding needs. Sources of credit in the capital markets have tightened significantly, demand for
mortgage loans in the secondary market has decreased, securities and debt ratings have been
downgraded and a number of institutions have defaulted on their debt. These market disruptions have
made it more difficult for financial institutions to borrow money. In addition, in April&nbsp;2008, the
FHLB of Atlanta notified its member financial institutions that it will increase the discount it
applies to residential first mortgage collateral, thereby decreasing the total amount that
BankAtlantic and others may borrow from the FHLB. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty
how long these market conditions may continue, nor can we anticipate the degree that such market
conditions may impact our operations. Deterioration in the performance of other financial
institutions, including charge-offs of loans, impairments of securities, debt-rating downgrades and
defaults may continue and may adversely impact the ability of all financial institutions to access
liquidity. There is no assurance that further deterioration in the financial markets will not
result in additional market-wide liquidity problems, and affect our liquidity position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FHLB has granted BankAtlantic a line of credit capped at 40% of assets subject to
available collateral, with a maximum term of ten years. BankAtlantic had utilized its FHLB line of
credit to borrow $967.0&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. The line of credit is secured by a blanket
lien on BankAtlantic&#146;s residential mortgage loans and certain commercial real estate and consumer
home equity loans. BankAtlantic&#146;s available borrowings under this line of credit were
approximately $672&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008. BankAtlantic also participated in the Treasury&#146;s
term auction program. BankAtlantic had $236.0&nbsp;million outstanding pursuant to this Treasury
program as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. An additional source of liquidity for BankAtlantic is its
securities portfolio. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic had $231&nbsp;million of un-pledged
securities that could be sold or pledged for additional borrowings with the FHLB, the Federal
Reserve or other financial institutions. BankAtlantic has established lines of credit for up to
$35&nbsp;million with other banks to purchase federal funds of which no amounts were outstanding as of
December&nbsp;31, 2008. BankAtlantic is also a participating institution in the Federal Reserve
Treasury Investment Program for up to $50&nbsp;million in fundings and at December&nbsp;31, 2008,
BankAtlantic had $2.3&nbsp;million of short-term borrowings outstanding under this program. BankAtlantic
is also eligible to participate in the Federal Reserve&#146;s discount window program. The amount that
can be borrowed under this program is dependent on available collateral. BankAtlantic had no
amounts outstanding under this program at December&nbsp;31, 2008. The above lines of credit are subject
to periodic review, may be terminated at any time by the issuer institution and are unsecured. If
the current economic trends continue to adversely affect our performance, the above borrowings may
be limited, or may not be available to us and BankAtlantic&#146;s liquidity would be materially
adversely affected.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic also has various relationships to acquire brokered deposits, and to execute
repurchase agreements, which may be utilized as an alternative source of liquidity, if needed. At
December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic had $239.9&nbsp;million and $46.1&nbsp;million of brokered deposits and
securities sold under agreements to repurchase outstanding. Additionally, BankAtlantic had
federal funds sold of $20.8&nbsp;million and total cash on hand or with other financial institutions of
$127.7&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s commitments to originate and purchase loans at December&nbsp;31, 2008 were $38.4
million and $3.0, respectively, compared to $176.9&nbsp;million and $61.1&nbsp;million, respectively, at
December&nbsp;31, 2007. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, total loan commitments represented approximately 0.90%
of net loans receivable.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic had mortgage-backed securities of approximately $47.9
million pledged to secure securities sold under agreements to repurchase, $109.3&nbsp;million pledged
to secure public deposits, $225.4&nbsp;million pledged to secure term auction facilities and $51.4
million pledged to secure treasury tax and loan accounts.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in cash flows from operating activities during 2008 compared to 2007 was
primarily due to a reduction in non-interest expenses. The Company experienced a decline in
employee compensation associated with its restructuring plan that included reduced store hours and
the consolidation of back-office facilities. The Company also reduced its advertising and
promotion expense by 18% during 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in cash flows from operating
activities during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily resulted from a substantial increase in
non-interest income from service charges on deposits as well as a significant reduction in
advertising and promotion expenses. During 2007, service charge fees increased primarily due to
new deposit accounts.

resulted from a decline in interest earning assets as loan and securities repayments exceeded loan
originations and securities purchased. The Company reduced its total assets during 2008 in order
to improve its regulatory capital levels in response to the difficult economic environment. The
increase in cash flows from investing activities during 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to
a decline in net loan originations and decreased purchases of property and equipment.

from the prepayments of FHLB advances. The prepayments were accompanied by a decline in interest
earning assets. The decrease in cash flows from financing activities during 2007 compared to 2006
primarily resulted from net repayments of FHLB advances as well as the purchase and retirement of
the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lines of credit are primarily revolving lines to home equity and business loan customers.
The business loans usually expire in less than one year and the home equity lines generally expire
in 15&nbsp;years.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by BankAtlantic to guarantee the
performance of a customer to a third party. BankAtlantic standby letters of credit are generally
issued to customers in the construction industry guaranteeing project performance. These types of
standby letters of credit had a maximum exposure of $14.1&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008.
BankAtlantic also issues standby letters of credit to commercial lending customers guaranteeing the
payment of goods and services. These types of standby letters of credit had a maximum exposure of
$6.4&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and
private borrowing arrangements and have maturities of one year or less. The credit risk involved
in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to
customers. BankAtlantic may hold certificates of deposit and residential and commercial real estate
liens as collateral for such commitments, similar to other types of borrowings.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other commercial commitments are agreements to lend funds to a customer as long as there is no
violation of any condition established in the commitment. Commitments generally have fixed
expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the
commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements. BankAtlantic evaluates each customer&#146;s
creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral required by BankAtlantic in
connection with an extension of credit is based on management&#146;s credit evaluation of the
counter-party.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company did not have off balance sheet arrangements that would have
a material effect on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Critical Accounting Policies</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management views critical accounting policies as accounting policies that are important to
the understanding of our financial statements and also involve estimates and judgments about
inherently uncertain matters. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of
financial condition and assumptions that affect the recognition of income and expenses on the
consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented. Actual results could differ
significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to
significant change in subsequent periods relate to the determination of the allowance for loan
losses, evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, the valuation of
securities as well as the determination of other-than-temporary declines in value, the valuation
of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans, the amount of
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, accounting for uncertain tax positions, accounting for
contingencies, and assumptions used in the valuation of stock based compensation. The four
accounting policies that we have identified as critical accounting policies are: (i)&nbsp;allowance for
loan losses; (ii)&nbsp;valuation of securities as well as the determination of other-than-temporary
declines in value; (iii)&nbsp;impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets; and (iv)&nbsp;the
accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowance. We have discussed the critical accounting
estimates outlined below with our audit committee of our board of directors, and the audit
committee has reviewed our disclosure. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to
the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148;, for a detailed discussion of our significant
accounting policies.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Allowance for loan losses</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount that we believe to be adequate to
absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. We have developed policies and procedures
for evaluating our allowance for loan losses which consider all information available to us.
However, we must rely on estimates and judgments regarding issues where the outcome is unknown.
As a consequence, if circumstances differ from our estimates and judgments the allowance for loan
losses may decrease or increase significantly.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calculation of our allowance for loan losses consists of two components. The first
component requires us to identify impaired loans based on management classification and, if
necessary, assign a valuation allowance to the impaired loans. Valuation allowances are
established using management estimates of the fair value of collateral or based on valuation
models that present value estimated expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective
interest rate. These valuations are based on available information and require estimates and
subjective judgments about fair values of the collateral or expected future cash flows. Most of
our loans do not have an observable market price and an estimate of the collection of contractual
cash flows is based on the judgment of management. It is likely that we would obtain materially
different results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. As a consequence of the
estimates and assumptions required to calculate the first component of our allowance for loan
losses, a change in these highly uncertain estimates could have a materially favorable or
unfavorable impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second component of the allowance for loan losses requires us to group loans that have
similar credit risk characteristics so as to form a basis for estimating probable losses inherent
in the group of loans based on historical loss percentages and delinquency trends as it relates to
the group. Management assigns a quantitative allowance to these groups of loans by utilizing
historical loss experiences. Management also assigns a qualitative allowance to these groups of
loans in order to adjust the historical data for qualitative factors that exist currently that
were not present in the historical data. These qualitative factors include delinquency trends,
loan classification migration trends, economic and business conditions, concentration of credit
risk, loan-to-value ratios, problem loan trends and external factors. In deriving the qualitative
allowance management uses significant judgment to qualitatively adjust the historical loss
experiences for current trends that existed at period end that were not reflected in the
calculated historical loss ratios and to adjust the allowance for the changes in the current
economic climate compared to the economic environment that existed historically. A subsequent
change in data trends or the external environment may result in material changes in this component
of the allowance from period to period.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management believes that the allowance for loan losses reflects a reasonable estimate of
incurred credit losses as of the statement of financial condition date. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008,
our allowance for loan losses was $137.3&nbsp;million. See &#147;Provision for Loan Losses&#148; for a discussion
of the amounts of our allowance assigned to each loan product. The estimated allowance, which was
derived from the above methodology, may be significantly different from actual realized losses.
Actual losses incurred in the future are highly dependent upon future events, including the
economies of geographic areas in which we hold loans, especially in Florida. These factors are
beyond management&#146;s control. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will not incur credit
losses far in excess of the amounts estimated by our allowance for loan losses. In addition,
various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review
our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the
allowance based on their judgments and information available to them at the time of their
examination.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We analyze our loan portfolio by monitoring the loan mix, credit quality, loan-to-value
ratios, historical trends and economic conditions quarterly. As a consequence, our allowance for
loan losses estimates will change from period to period. A portion of the change in our loan loss
estimates during the four year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 resulted from changes in credit
policies which focused our loan production on collateral based loans and the discontinuation of
certain loan products. We believe that these changes reduced our allowance for loan losses as
measured by the decline in our allowance to loan losses to total loans from 1.38% at December&nbsp;31,
2002 to 0.94% at December&nbsp;31, 2006. During this period real estate markets experienced
significant price increases accompanied by an abundance of available mortgage financing. We
believe that these external factors favorably impacted our provision for loan losses and allowance
for loan losses through this four year period. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2008
the residential real estate market and general economic conditions, both nationally and in
Florida, rapidly deteriorated with significant reductions in the sales prices and volume of
residential real estate sold. These rapidly deteriorating real estate market conditions and
adverse economic conditions resulted in a significant increase in our ratio of allowance for loan
losses to total loans from 0.94% at December&nbsp;31, 2006 to 2.87% at December&nbsp;31, 2008. We believe
that our earnings in subsequent periods will be highly sensitive to changes in the Florida real
estate market as well as the length of the current recession, availability of mortgage financing
and the severity of unemployment in Florida. If the current negative real estate and economic
conditions continue or deteriorate further we are likely to experience significantly increased
credit losses.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We record our securities available for sale and derivative instruments in our statement of
financial condition at fair value. We also disclose fair value estimates in our statement of
financial condition for investment securities at cost. We generally use market and income
approach valuation techniques and a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in
valuation techniques. Our policy is to use quoted market prices (Level 1 inputs) when available.
However quoted market prices are not available for our mortgage-backed securities, REMIC&#146;s, other
securities and certain equity securities requiring us to use Level 2 and Level 3 inputs. The
classification of assumptions as Level 2 or Level 3 inputs is based on judgment and the
classification of the inputs could change based on the availability of observable market data.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We subscribe to a third-party service to assist us in determining the fair value of our
mortgage-backed securities and real estate mortgage conduits. The estimated fair value of these
securities at December&nbsp;31, 2008 was $699.2&nbsp;million. We use matrix pricing to value these
securities as identical securities that we own are not traded on active markets. Matrix pricing
computes the fair value of mortgage-backed securities and real estate mortgage conduits based on
the coupon rate, maturity date and estimates of future prepayment rates obtained from trades of
securities with similar characteristic and from market data obtained from brokers. We consider
the above inputs Level 2. The valuations obtained from the matrix pricing are not actual
transactions and may not reflect the actual amount that would be realized upon sale. While the
interest rate and prepayment assumptions used in the matrix pricing are representative of
assumptions that we believe market participants would use in valuing these securities, different
assumptions may result in significantly different results. Additionally, current observable data
may not be available in subsequent periods resulting in us obtaining level 3 inputs to value these
securities. The mortgage-backed and REMIC securities that we own are government agency guaranteed
with minimal credit risk. These securities are of high credit quality and we believe can be
liquidated in the near future; however, the price obtained upon sale could be higher or lower than
the fair value obtained through matrix pricing. In light of the current volatility and
uncertainty in credit markets, it is

December&nbsp;31, 2008 was $1.8&nbsp;million of equity and debt securities that lack market liquidity and
trade in inactive markets. These securities are fair valued through the use of non-binding broker
quotes (Level 3 inputs). As these quotes are non-binding and not actual transactions, the values
we have obtained may not reflect the actual amount that would be realized upon sale. No current
market exists for these securities and the liquidation of these securities is subject to
significant uncertainty.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We disclosed the estimated fair value of our private investment securities at $2.5&nbsp;million in
our statement of financial condition. These securities represent investments in limited
partnerships that invest in equity securities based on proprietary investment strategies or
private placements. The majority of the underlying equity securities investments of the limited
partnerships are publicly traded. The fair value of these investments in our statement of
financial condition was obtained from the general partner or management of the private placements
(Level 3). These investments do not have readily determinable fair values and the fair values
calculated by us do not represent actual transactions. Amounts realized upon the sale of our
interest in these investments may be higher or lower than the amounts disclosed. No current

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We perform an evaluation on a quarterly basis to determine if any of our securities are
other-than-temporarily impaired. In making this determination, we consider the extent and duration
of the impairment, the nature and financial condition of the issuer and our ability and intent to
hold securities for a period sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. If a
security is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we record an impairment loss as a
charge to income for the period in which the impairment loss is determined to exist, resulting in a
reduction to our earnings for that period. The value of the Company&#146;s investment in private equity
securities has significantly declined during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. As a consequence of
our quarterly evaluation, we recognized a $4.5&nbsp;million permanent impairment associated with these
securities. The evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment of securities requires significant
management judgment on the financial condition of the issuer and the ability of the issuer to
recover the impairment. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008 the Company had $32.2&nbsp;million of impaired
securities with an unrealized loss of $1.0&nbsp;million. We concluded the unrealized loss was temporary
due to what we believe to be the high credit quality of these agency securities and our intent and
ability to hold these securities beyond the period of time when we believe the impairment would be
recovered. However, in light of the current challenging economic and credit conditions, there is
no assurance that future events will not cause us to change this conclusion or that the impairment
would be recovered.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We test goodwill for impairment annually or when events or circumstances occur that my result
in goodwill impairment during interim periods. The test requires us to determine the fair value of
our reporting units and compare the reporting units&#146; fair value to its carrying value. The
Company&#146;s reporting units are comprised of Community Banking, Commercial Lending, Tax Certificate
Operations, Capital Services and Investment Operations. The fair values of the reporting units are
estimated using discounted cash flow present value valuation models and market multiple techniques.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While management believes the sources utilized to arrive at the fair value estimates are
reliable, different sources or methods could have yielded different fair value estimates. These
fair value estimates require a significant amount of judgment. If the fair value of a reporting
unit is below the carrying amount a second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed. This
second step requires us to fair value all assets (recognized and unrecognized) and liabilities in a
manner similar to a purchase price allocation. There is no active market for many of the Company&#146;s
assets requiring management to derive the fair value of the majority of these assets using net
present value models. As a consequence, management estimates rely on assumptions and judgments

reporting units and the underlying assets as well as declines in the Company&#146;s market
capitalization may affect future earnings through the recognition of additional goodwill impairment
charges of up to $22.2&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $48.3
million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008 our goodwill was $22.2&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the fair value of the reporting units, the Company used a combination of the
discounted cash flow techniques and market multiple methodologies. These methods require
assumptions for expected cash flows, discount rates, and comparable financial institutions to
determine market multiples. The aggregate fair value of all reporting units derived from the
above valuation techniques was compared to the Company&#146;s market capitalization adjusted for a
control premium in order to determine the reasonableness of the financial model output. A control
premium represents the value an investor would pay above minority interest transaction prices in
order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective company. The values separately derived
from each valuation technique (i.e., discounted cash flow and market multiples) were used to
develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit&#146;s fair value. Different weighting of the various
fair value techniques could result in a higher or lower fair value. Judgment is applied in
determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value. The Company used financial
projections over a period of time considered necessary to achieve a steady state of cash flows for
each reporting unit. The primary assumptions in the projections were anticipated loan and deposit
growth, interest rates and revenue growth. The discount rates were estimated based on the Capital
Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and
unsystematic risk and size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The
estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in the discount rate and
terminal value assumptions. Minor changes in these assumptions could impact significantly the fair
value assigned to a reporting unit. Future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the
estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below
its carrying value.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value, goodwill may be
impaired. In those situations step-two of the goodwill impairment evaluation is performed which
involves calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill. The implied fair
value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as it is determined in a business combination.
The fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s assets and liabilities, including previously unrecognized
intangible assets, is individually determined. The excess fair value of the reporting unit over the
fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s net assets is the implied goodwill. Significant judgment and
estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting
unit.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of the implied goodwill is highly sensitive to the estimated fair value of the
reporting unit&#146;s net assets. The fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s net assets is estimated using a
variety of valuation techniques including the following:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When testing a long-lived
asset for recoverability, it may be necessary to review estimated lives and adjust the depreciation
period. Changes in circumstances and the estimates of future cash flows as well as evaluating
estimated lives of long-lived assets are subjective and involve a significant amount of judgment.
A change in the estimated life of a long-lived asset may substantially increase depreciation and
amortization expense in subsequent periods. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an
impairment loss, we are required to group long-lived assets at the lowest level for which
identifiable cash flows are independent of other assets. These cash flows are based on projections
from management reports which are based on subjective interdepartmental allocations. Fair values
are not available for many of our long-lived assets, and estimates must be based on available
information, including prices of similar assets and present value valuation techniques using level
3 unobservable inputs. Long-lived assets subject to the above impairment analysis included
property and equipment, internal-use software, real estate held for development and sale and real
estate owned.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, we halted our store expansion program, consolidated
back-office facilities, terminated or subleased certain operating lease contracts and reduced our
store operating hours. As a consequence, we recognized an impairment charge of $7.4&nbsp;million. A
portion of the impairment charge is based on the fair value of real estate, equipment and
unfavorable contracts. These fair value amounts were based on market-based estimates and net
present value models. These estimates and assumptions are highly subjective and based on
significant management estimates. The amount ultimately realized upon the sale of these properties
or the termination of these unfavorable contracts may be significantly different than the recorded
amounts. The assumptions used are representative of assumptions that we believe market
participants would use in fair valuing these assets or lease contracts, while different
assumptions may result in significantly different results.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company reviews the carrying amount of its deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if
the establishment of a valuation allowance is necessary. If, based on the available evidence, it
is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets will not be
realized, a deferred tax valuation allowance would be established. Consideration is given to all
positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In evaluating the available evidence, management considered historical financial performance,
expectation of future earnings, length of statutory carry forward periods, experience with
operating loss and tax credit carry forwards not expiring unused, tax planning strategies and
timing of reversals of temporary differences. Significant judgment is required in assessing future
earnings trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences. The Company&#146;s evaluation is
based on current tax laws as well as management&#146;s expectations of future performance based on its
strategic initiatives. Changes in existing tax laws and future results differing from expectations
may result in significant changes in the deferred tax assets valuation allowance.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our evaluation as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, a net deferred tax asset valuation allowance
was established for the entire amount of the Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets as the realization
of these assets did not meet the more-likely-than-not criteria of statement of financial accounting
standard No.&nbsp;109. During the fourth quarter of 2008, market conditions in the financial services
industry significantly deteriorated with the bankruptcies and government bail-outs of large
financial services entities. This market turmoil led to a tightening of credit, lack of consumer
confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction in business activity. These
economic conditions adversely effected BankAtlantic&#146;s profitable lines of business and it does not
appear that these challenging market conditions are likely to improve in the foreseeable future.
As a consequence of the worsening economic conditions during the fourth quarter of 2008, it
appeared more-likely-than-not that the Company would not realize its deferred tax assets resulting
in a deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the entire amount of the Company&#146;s net deferred tax
assets. However, significant judgment is required in evaluating the positive and negative evidence
for the establishment of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, and if future events differ
from expectations or if there are changes in the tax laws, a substantial portion or the entire
deferred tax asset benefit may be realized in the future. The Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets can
be carried forward for 20&nbsp;years and applied to offset future taxable income.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to focus on managing our real estate holdings during this challenging period for
the real estate industry, and on efforts to bring costs in line with our strategic objectives. We
have taken steps to align our staffing levels and compensation with these objectives. Our goal is
to pursue acquisitions and investments in diverse industries, including investments in affiliates,
using a combination of our cash and stock and third party equity and debt financing. This
business strategy may result in acquisitions and investments both within and outside of the real
estate industry. We may acquire entire businesses or majority or minority, non-controlling
interests in companies. Under this business model, we likely will not generate a consistent
earnings stream and the composition of our revenues may vary widely due to factors inherent in a
particular investment, including the maturity and cyclical nature of, and market conditions
relating to, the business invested in. We expect that net investment gains and other income will
depend on the success of our investments as well as overall market conditions. We also intend to
pursue strategic initiatives with a view to enhancing liquidity. These initiatives may include
pursuing alternatives to monetize a portion of our interests in certain of Core&#146;s assets through
sale, possible joint ventures or other strategic relationships.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our operations have historically been concentrated in the real estate industry which is
cyclical in nature. Our largest subsidiary is Core Communities, a developer of master-planned
communities, which sells land to residential builders as well as to commercial developers, and
internally develops, constructs and leases income producing commercial real estate. In addition,
our Other Operations segment consists of an equity investment in Bluegreen, a NYSE-listed company,
which represents approximately 31% of Bluegreen&#146;s outstanding common stock, a consolidated
investment in Pizza Fusion, a private company in which we made a $3.0&nbsp;million investment in the
third quarter of 2008 which represents approximately 41% of Pizza Fusion&#146;s outstanding stock, and a
cost method investment in Office Depot, a NYSE- listed company in which we own less than 1% of the
outstanding common stock. Bluegreen is engaged in the acquisition, development, marketing and sale
of ownership interests in primarily &#147;drive-to&#148; vacation resorts, and the development and sale of
golf communities and residential land. Our Other Operations segment also includes the activities of
our consolidated subsidiary, Carolina Oak, which engaged in homebuilding activities at Tradition
Hilton Head prior to the suspension of those activities during the fourth quarter of 2008. As
previously reported, the results of operations and financial condition of Carolina Oak as of and
for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006 were included in the Primary Homebuilding segment
because its financial metrics were similar in nature to the other homebuilding projects within that
segment. However, due to our acquisition of Carolina Oak and the deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons
as of November&nbsp;9, 2007, which comprised our Primary Homebuilding and Tennessee Homebuilding
segments, the results of operations and financial condition of Carolina Oak as of and for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 are included in the Other Operations segment.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management views critical accounting policies as accounting policies that are important to the
understanding of our financial statements and also involve estimates and judgments about inherently
uncertain matters. In preparing financial statements, management is required to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and
assumptions that affect the recognition of revenues and expenses on the consolidated statements of
operations for the periods presented. These estimates require the exercise of judgment, as future
events cannot be determined with certainty. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible
to significant change in subsequent periods relate to revenue and cost recognition on percent
complete projects, reserves and accruals, impairment reserves of assets, valuation of real estate,
estimated costs to complete construction, reserves for litigation and contingencies and deferred
tax valuation allowances. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis of making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ significantly from these
estimates if conditions change or if certain key assumptions used in making these estimates
ultimately prove to be materially incorrect.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have identified the following accounting policies that management views as critical to the
accurate portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under ARB No.&nbsp;51, consolidation of a majority-owned subsidiary is precluded where control does
not rest with the majority owners. Under these rules, legal reorganization or bankruptcy represents
conditions which can preclude consolidation or equity method accounting as control rests with the
Bankruptcy Court, rather than the majority owner. As described elsewhere in this report, Levitt and
Sons, our wholly-owned subsidiary, filed a petition for bankruptcy on November&nbsp;9, 2007.
Accordingly, we deconsolidated Levitt and Sons as of November&nbsp;9, 2007, eliminating all future
operations from our financial results of operations. In accordance with ARB No.&nbsp;51, we follow the
cost method of accounting to record our interest in Levitt and Sons. Under cost method accounting,
income may be recognized to the extent only cash is received in the future or when Levitt and Sons
is legally released from its bankruptcy obligations through the approval of the Bankruptcy Court,
at which time any loss in excess of the investment in Levitt and Sons will be recognized into
income. See (Note 24) to our audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective January&nbsp;1, 2008, we partially adopted the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;157, <I>&#147;Fair Value
Measurements&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;157&#148;), which requires us to disclose the fair value of our investments in
unconsolidated trusts and equity securities, including our investments in Bluegreen and Office
Depot. Under this standard, fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale
of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date (an exit price). In determining fair value, we are sometimes required to
use various valuation techniques. SFAS No.&nbsp;157 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring
fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs
by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. As a basis for considering
such assumptions, SFAS No.&nbsp;157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the
inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We follow the equity method of accounting to record our interests in entities in which we do
not own the majority of the voting stock or record our investment in VIEs in which we are not the
primary beneficiary. These entities consist of Bluegreen Corporation and statutory business
trusts. The statutory business trusts are VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. Under
the equity method, the initial investment in a joint venture is recorded at cost and is
subsequently adjusted to recognize our share of the joint venture&#146;s earnings or losses.
Distributions received and other-than-temporary impairments reduce the carrying amount of the
investment.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Cost Method</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use the cost method for investments where we own less than a 20% interest and do not have
the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial policies of the investee in
accordance with relative accounting guidance. SFAS No.&nbsp;115, &#147;<I>Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities&#148;</I>, requires us to designate our securities as held to maturity, available
for sale, or trading, depending on our intent with regard to our investments at the time of
purchase. There are currently no securities classified as held to maturity or trading.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with net unrealized
gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), but do
not impact our results of operations. Changes in fair value are taken to income when a decline in
value is considered other-than-temporary.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We review our equity and cost method investments quarterly for indicators of
other-than-temporary impairment in accordance with FSP FAS 115-1/FAS 124-1 and SAB No.&nbsp;59. This
determination requires significant judgment in which we evaluate, among other factors, the fair

cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment until it recovers. We also consider
specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the
investee, including industry and sector performance, rating agency actions, changes in operational
and financing cash flow factors. If a decline in the fair value of the investment is determined to
be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the investment to its fair
value and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Goodwill and Intangible Assets</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recorded certain intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of Pizza Fusion.
Intangible assets consist primarily of franchise contracts which were valued using a discounted
cash flow methodology and are amortized over the average life of the franchise contracts. The
estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments
regarding future periods that are subject to outside factors. In accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144, we
evaluate when events and circumstances indicate that assets may be impaired and when the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying
amounts. The carrying value of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings that we
expect to generate. If cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets may be impaired and
would be written down to their fair value.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On at least an annual basis, we conduct a review of our goodwill in accordance with SFAS No.
142, <I>&#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;142&#148;), to determine whether the carrying
value of goodwill exceeds the fair market value using a discounted cash flow methodology. In the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, we conducted an impairment review of the goodwill related to our
Tennessee Homebuilding segment, the operations of which were comprised of the activities of Bowden
Building Corporation, which we acquired in 2004. We used a discounted cash flow methodology to
determine the amount of impairment resulting in completely writing off goodwill of approximately
$1.3&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. The write-off is included in other expenses in
the consolidated statements of operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Revenue Recognition</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue and all related costs and expenses from house and land sales are recognized at the
time that closing has occurred, when title and possession of the property and the risks and rewards
of ownership transfer to the buyer, and when we do not have a substantial continuing involvement in
accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;66, <I>&#147;Accounting for Sales of Real Estate&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS 66&#148;). In order to
properly match revenues with expenses, we estimate construction and land development costs incurred
and to be incurred, but not paid at the time of closing. Estimated costs to complete are determined
for each closed home and land sale based upon historical data with respect to similar product types
and geographical areas and allocated to closings along with actual costs incurred based on a
relative sales value approach. To the extent the estimated costs to complete have significantly
changed, we will adjust cost of sales in the current period for the impact on cost of sales of
previously sold homes and land to ensure a consistent margin of sales is maintained.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue is recognized for certain land sales on the percentage-of-completion method when the
land sale takes place prior to all contracted work being completed. Pursuant to the requirements
of SFAS 66, if the seller has a continuing involvement with the property and does not transfer
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership, profit is recognized based on the nature
and extent of the seller&#146;s continuing involvement. In the case of our land sales, this
involvement typically consists of final development activities. We recognize revenue and related
costs as work progresses using the percentage-of-completion method, which relies on estimates of
total expected costs to complete required work. Revenue is recognized in proportion to the
percentage of total costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs at the time of sale.
Actual revenues and costs to complete construction in the future could differ from our current
estimates. If our estimates of development costs remaining to be completed and relative sales
values are significantly different from actual amounts, then our revenues, related cumulative
profits and costs of sales may be revised in the period that estimates change.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other revenues consist primarily of rental property income, marketing revenues, irrigation

property. We review all new leases in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;13 <I>&#147;Accounting for Leases&#148;</I>. If the
lease contains fixed escalations for rent, free-rent periods or upfront incentives, rental revenue
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective January&nbsp;1, 2006, Bluegreen adopted AICPA Statement of Position 04-02, &#147;<I>Accounting
for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions</I>&#148; (&#147;SOP 04-02&#148;). This Statement amends FASB Statement No.
67, &#147;<I>Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects&#148; </I>(&#147;FAS No.&nbsp;67&#148;),
to state that the guidance for incidental operations and costs incurred to sell real estate
projects does not apply to real estate time-sharing transactions. The accounting for those
operations and costs is subject to the guidance in SOP 04-02. Bluegreen&#146;s adoption of SOP 04-02
resulted in a one-time, non-cash, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle charge of
$4.5&nbsp;million to Bluegreen for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, and accordingly reduced the
earnings in Bluegreen recorded by us by approximately $1.4&nbsp;million for the same period.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Income Taxes</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We record income taxes using the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
consequence of temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of our
assets and liabilities. We estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we
operate. This process involves estimating our tax exposure together with assessing temporary
differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred revenue, for tax and
accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are
included within our consolidated statements of financial condition. The recording of a net
deferred tax asset assumes the realization of such asset in the future. Otherwise, a valuation
allowance must be recorded to reduce this asset to its net realizable value. We consider future
pretax income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for such a
valuation allowance. In the event that we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part
of the net deferred tax asset in the future, a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset is
charged against income in the period such determination is made. See Item&nbsp;1. &#147;Business &#150; Recent
Developments&#148; for a description of the shareholder rights plan we adopted in September&nbsp;2008 which
is aimed at preserving our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future
taxable income.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We file a consolidated Federal and Florida income tax return. Separate state returns are
filed by subsidiaries that operate outside the state of Florida. Even though Levitt and Sons and
its subsidiaries have been deconsolidated from Woodbridge for financial statement purposes, they
continue to be included in our Federal and Florida consolidated tax returns until the discharge of
Levitt and Sons from bankruptcy. See (Note 21) for information regarding the bankruptcy filing of
Levitt and Sons. As a result of the deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons, all of Levitt and Sons&#146; net
deferred tax assets are no longer presented in the consolidated statement of financial condition at
December&nbsp;31, 2008 but remain a part of Levitt and Sons&#146; condensed consolidated financial statements
at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and accordingly will be part of the tax return.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;48, &#147;<I>Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes &#150; an interpretation of FASB No.&nbsp;109</I>&#148; (&#147;FIN 48&#148;), on January&nbsp;1, 2007. FIN 48 provides
guidance on recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in financial statements of
uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. FIN 48
substantially changes the accounting policy for uncertain tax positions. As a result of the
implementation of FIN 48, we recognized a decrease of $260,000 in the liability for unrecognized
tax benefits, which was accounted for as an increase to the January&nbsp;1, 2007 balance of retained
earnings. At December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, we had gross tax-affected unrecognized tax benefits of
$2.4&nbsp;million, of which $0.2&nbsp;million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

compared to a consolidated net loss of $234.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. During
2008, we recorded impairment charges of $112.0&nbsp;million, of which $108.5&nbsp;million related to our
investments and $3.5&nbsp;million related to Carolina Oak&#146;s inventory of real estate, compared to
impairment charges of $226.9&nbsp;million related to Levitt and Sons&#146; inventory of real estate recorded
during 2007 in cost of sales. Levitt and Sons incurred a net loss of $231.4&nbsp;million for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, which represented 98.6% of our consolidated net loss for that period. As
previously disclosed, we deconsolidated Levitt and Sons as of November&nbsp;9, 2007. Excluding the
results of Levitt and Sons, the net loss increased by $135.0&nbsp;million for the year ended December
31, 2008, primarily due to impairment charges recorded in 2008 relating to our investments in
Bluegreen, Office Depot and unconsolidated trusts, and impairment charges relating to Carolina
Oak&#146;s inventory of real estate. No impairment charges related to these items were recorded in 2007.
In addition, our total revenues decreased in both the Land Division and Other Operations segment
during 2008 as sales of real estate decreased reflecting a further deterioration of the real estate
markets, interest expense increased because less assets qualified for interest capitalization, our
earnings from Bluegreen decreased as Bluegreen&#146;s net income decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 and
the benefit for income taxes decreased as our effective tax rate for 2008 was 0.0% compared to 8.6%
in 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of real estate decreased to $13.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2008 from $410.1&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. This decrease was primarily
attributable to the deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons at November&nbsp;9, 2007 as well as a decrease in
sales of real estate in the Land Division and Other Operations. Levitt and Sons&#146; revenues from
sales of real estate amounted to $387.7&nbsp;million in 2007. Revenues from sales of real estate for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 in the Land Division decreased to $11.3&nbsp;million, from $16.6&nbsp;million in
2007 reflecting the sale of approximately 35 acres in 2008 compared to 40 acres in 2007. In Other
Operations, revenues from sales of real estate for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 were $2.5
million reflecting the delivery of 8 units in Carolina Oak, compared to revenues from sales of real
estate of $6.6&nbsp;million in Levitt Commercial reflecting the delivery of 17 units in 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other revenues increased $1.2&nbsp;million to $11.7&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008,
compared to $10.5&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. Other revenues increased
primarily as a result of higher leasing revenues due to the opening of the Landing at Tradition
retail power center in late 2007. The increase was offset in part by decreased title and mortgage
operations revenues associated with Levitt and Sons as it was not included in the consolidated
results of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. In addition, there was decreased
marketing income associated with Tradition, Florida.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of sales of real estate decreased to $12.7&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2008, as compared to $20.7&nbsp;million (excluding cost of sales, which included impairment provisions,
associated with Levitt and Sons) for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 as sales of real estate
decreased in the Land Division and Other Operations. Cost of sales of real estate in the Land
Division decreased as we sold approximately 35 acres in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, compared
to approximately 40 acres in 2007. In Other Operations, we delivered 8 units in Carolina Oak in the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, compared to the delivery of 17 units in Levitt Commercial in 2007. In
addition, we recorded $3.5&nbsp;million of impairment charges related to Carolina Oak&#146;s inventory of
real estate in 2008, compared to $9.3&nbsp;million in impairment charges related to capitalized interest
in Other Operations recorded in 2007.

the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared to $117.9&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2007. This decrease was primarily related to the deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons at November&nbsp;9,
2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to Levitt and Sons in the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 were $66.6&nbsp;million. Consolidated selling, general and administrative
expenses, excluding those attributable to Levitt and Sons, remained relatively unchanged in 2008
compared to 2007 totaling $50.8&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, and $51.3&nbsp;million in
2007. We incurred higher property management expenses related to our commercial leasing activities,
higher property tax expense due to less acreage in active development and higher expenses related
to the support of community and commercial associations in our master-planned communities in the
Land Division as well as higher other administrative expenses associated with marketing activities
in South Carolina in 2008 compared to 2007. In

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">addition, depreciation expenses were higher in 2008 mainly as a result of a depreciation
recapture related to the reclassification of discontinued operations, and insurance costs were
higher due to the absorption of certain of Levitt and Sons&#146; insurance costs. The above increases
were offset by lower office related expenses, decreased severance charges and decreased employee
compensation, benefits and incentives expense reflecting a lower associate headcount in the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of staff reductions. The number of employees
decreased to 84 employees at December&nbsp;31, 2008 from 125 employees at December&nbsp;31, 2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest expense consists of interest incurred minus interest capitalized. Interest incurred
for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007 totaled $22.4&nbsp;million and $50.8&nbsp;million,
respectively, while interest capitalized totaled $11.5&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008
compared to $47.0&nbsp;million in 2007. Interest expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 was $10.9
million compared to $3.8&nbsp;million in 2007. The increase in interest expense was due to the
completion of certain phases of development associated with our real estate inventory late in 2007,
which resulted in a decreased amount of assets which qualified for interest capitalization and,
therefore, the expensing of the related interest was only recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007
compared to the full year of 2008. Interest incurred was lower mainly due to decreases in the
average interest rates on our debt and lower outstanding balances of notes and mortgage notes
payable primarily due to the deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons at November&nbsp;9, 2007. At the time
of land or home sales, the capitalized interest allocated to inventory is charged to cost of sales.
Cost of sales of real estate for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007 included previously
capitalized interest of approximately $326,000 and $17.9&nbsp;million, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not incur other expenses in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, compared to $3.9&nbsp;million
in 2007, which consisted of a surety bond accrual, a write-off of leasehold improvements and title
and mortgage operations expense. Due to the cessation of most development activity at Levitt and
Sons&#146; projects, we evaluated Woodbridge&#146;s exposure on the surety bonds and letters of credit
supporting any Levitt and Sons projects based on indemnities Woodbridge provided to the bond
holders and recorded $1.8&nbsp;million in surety bonds accrual related to certain bonds where management
considered it probable that reimbursement of the surety under the applicable indemnity agreement
would be required. In addition to the surety bond accrual, the Other Operations segment also
recorded a write-off of leasehold improvements. As part of reductions in workforce, we vacated
certain leased space. Leasehold improvements in the amount of $564,000 related to the vacated
space will not be recovered and were written-off in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. In addition,
title and mortgage operations expense related to Levitt and Sons was $1.5&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen reported a net loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 of $516,000, compared to
net income of $31.9&nbsp;million in 2007. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, our interest in
Bluegreen&#146;s earnings was $9.0&nbsp;million (after the amortization of approximately $9.2&nbsp;million related
to the change in the basis as a result of the impairment charge on this investment at September&nbsp;30,
2008), compared to $10.3&nbsp;million in 2007. We review our investment in Bluegreen for impairment on a
quarterly basis or as events or circumstances warrant for other-than-temporary declines in value.
Based on the evaluations performed, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $53.6
million at September&nbsp;30, 2008 and an additional other-than-temporary impairment charge of $40.8
million at December&nbsp;31, 2008. See (Note 10) to our audited consolidated financial statements
included in Item&nbsp;8 for further details of the impairment analysis of our investment in Bluegreen.

$11.3&nbsp;million in 2007. This decrease was related to a $5.8&nbsp;million decrease in forfeited deposits
in 2008 due to the deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons at November&nbsp;9, 2007. The decrease was
partially offset by a $2.5&nbsp;million gain on sale of property and equipment and a $1.2&nbsp;million gain
on sale of equity securities during 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had an effective tax rate of 0.0% in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared to 8.6% in
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. The decrease in the effective tax rate is a result of recording a
valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that are not expected to be recovered in the
future. Due to large taxable losses in 2007 and 2008 and expected taxable losses in the foreseeable
future, we may not have sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future and
prior carryback years to realize any portion of the net deferred tax asset. At December&nbsp;31, 2008,
we had $155.6&nbsp;million in gross deferred tax assets. After consideration of $2.3&nbsp;million of
deferred tax liabilities, a valuation allowance of $154.1&nbsp;million was recorded. The increase in
the valuation allowance from December&nbsp;31, 2007 is $75.5&nbsp;million. See Item&nbsp;1. &#147;Business &#150; Recent

compared to a net loss of $9.2&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. The significant loss
in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 was the result of $226.9&nbsp;million of impairment charges recorded
relating to inventory of real estate of which $217.6&nbsp;million was recorded in the Homebuilding
Division and $9.3&nbsp;million was recorded in the Other Operations segment related to capitalized
interest. This compares to $36.8&nbsp;million of impairment charges recorded in the year ended December
31, 2006. In addition, there were decreased sales of real estate and margins on sales of real
estate by all segments, and higher selling, general and administrative expenses in the Other
Operations segment and our Land Division. Interest expense was $3.8&nbsp;million for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007 while there was no interest expense in 2006. These increased expenses and lower
sales of real estate were slightly offset by higher interest and other income as a result of higher
interest income and forfeited deposits, and an increase in other revenues related to increased
commercial lease activity generating higher rental revenues.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of real estate decreased to $410.1&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2007 from $566.1&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. This decrease was attributable to
fewer homes delivered in the Homebuilding Division, and fewer sales in both Other Operations and
the Land Division. The Homebuilding Division had lower revenue despite the average sales price of
units delivered increasing to $321,000 in 2007 compared to $302,000 in the same period in 2006 due
to the number of deliveries decreasing to 1,144 homes as compared to 1,660 homes during the same
period in 2006. In Other Operations, Levitt Commercial delivered 17 units during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007 recording $6.6&nbsp;million in revenues compared to 29 units during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2006 and $11.0&nbsp;million in revenues. The Land Division sold approximately 40 acres in
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 as compared to 371 acres in 2006. These decreases were slightly
offset by an increase in land sales recorded by the Homebuilding Division which totaled $20.1

from $9.2&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, due to increased commercial lease
activity generating higher rental revenues, offset in part by lower title and mortgage operations
revenues due to fewer closings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of sales of real estate increased $90.3&nbsp;million to $573.2&nbsp;million during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007, as compared to $483.0&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. The
increase in cost of sales was due to increased impairment charges in an aggregate amount of $226.9
million recorded in 2007 compared to $36.8&nbsp;million recorded in 2006. In addition, included in cost
of sales was approximately $18.8&nbsp;million associated with sales by both segments of the Homebuilding
Division of land that management decided not to develop further, while there were no similar sales
or costs in 2006. These increases were offset by lower cost of sales due to fewer land sales
recorded by the Land Division and the Other Operations segment and fewer units delivered by both
segments of the Homebuilding Division.

margin of 39.8% compared to a margin of 14.7% in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 primarily related
to the impairment charges recorded in the Homebuilding Division and Other Operations segment.
Consolidated gross margin excluding impairment charges was 15.5% in the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2007 compared to a gross margin of 21.2% in 2006. The decline was associated with significant
discounts offered in 2007 in an attempt to reduce cancellations and encourage buyers to close,
aggressive pricing discounts on &#147;spec units&#148; and a lower margin being earned on land sales.

expenses of Levitt and Sons were reflected through November&nbsp;9, 2007 compared to a full year of
selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006. These decreases were slightly offset by
increased selling, general and administrative expenses in the Land Division segment related to
operating costs associated with the commercial leasing business and increasing activity in the
master-planned community in Tradition Hilton Head and restructuring related expenses recorded in
Other Operations and the Homebuilding Division in the amount of $7.4&nbsp;million which included
severance related expenses, facilities expenses, and independent contractor expenses. As a
percentage of total revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 28.0%
during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, from 21.1% during 2006 as a result of decreased revenues.

2007 and 2006, respectively. While all interest was capitalized in the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2006, only $47.0&nbsp;million was capitalized in 2007. This resulted in interest expense of $3.8&nbsp;million
in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, compared to no interest expense in the same period in 2006.
The increase in interest expense was due to the completion of certain phases of development
associated with our real estate inventory, which resulted in a decreased amount of assets which
qualified for interest capitalization in 2007 compared to 2006. Interest incurred was higher due
to higher average debt balances for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 as compared to the same period
in 2006, as well as increases in the average interest rate on our variable-rate debt. At the time
of home closings and land sales, the capitalized interest allocated to such inventory is charged to
cost of sales. Cost of sales of real estate for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006 included

$3.7&nbsp;million in 2006. In the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, we recorded a surety bond accrual of
$1.8&nbsp;million that did not exist in 2006. In addition to the surety bond accrual, the Other
Operations segment also recorded a write-off of leasehold improvements which did not exist in 2006.
As part of the reductions in force discussed above and the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases, we vacated certain
leased space. Leasehold improvements in the amount of $564,000 related to the vacated space will
not be recovered and were written-off in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. These increases were
offset as we did not record a write-down of goodwill in 2007, compared to the write-down of
goodwill in 2006 of approximately $1.3&nbsp;million associated with the Tennessee Homebuilding segment.
In addition, title and mortgage expense decreased due to the decrease in closings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen reported net income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 of $31.9&nbsp;million, as
compared to net income of $29.8&nbsp;million in 2006. In the first quarter of 2006, Bluegreen adopted
SOP 04-02 and recorded a one-time, non-cash, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
charge of $4.5&nbsp;million, which contributed to the slight increase in 2007. Our interest in
Bluegreen&#146;s income was $10.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 compared to $9.7&nbsp;million
in 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest and other income increased from $7.8&nbsp;million during the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2006
to $11.3&nbsp;million during the same period in 2007. The increase was due to higher forfeited deposits
on cancelled contracts in our Homebuilding Division as well as higher interest income due to the
investment of the proceeds from the Rights Offering.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefit for income taxes had an effective rate of 8.6% in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007
compared to 38.6% in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. The decrease in the effective tax rate was
the result of recording a valuation allowance in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 for those
deferred tax assets that are not expected to be recovered in the future. At December&nbsp;31, 2007, we
had $102.6&nbsp;million in gross deferred tax assets. After consideration of $24.0&nbsp;million of deferred
tax liabilities and the ability to carryback losses, a valuation allowance of $78.6&nbsp;million was
recorded. The increase in the valuation allowance from December&nbsp;31, 2006 was $78.1&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the nature and size of individual land transactions, our Land Division results are
subject to significant volatility. Although we have historically realized margins of between
approximately 40.0% and 60.0% on Land Division sales, margins on land sales are likely to be below
the historical range given the downturn in the real estate markets and the significant decrease in
demand in Florida. Margins will fluctuate based upon changing sales prices and costs attributable
to the land sold. In addition to the impact of economic and market factors, the sales price and
margin of land sold varies depending upon: the location; the parcel size; whether the parcel is
sold as raw land, partially developed land or individually developed lots; the degree to which the
land is entitled; and whether the designated use of the land is residential or commercial. The
cost of sales of real estate is dependent upon the original cost of the land acquired, the timing
of the acquisition of the land, the amount of land development and interest and real estate tax
costs capitalized to the particular land parcel during active development. Allocations to cost of
sales involve significant management judgment and include an estimate of future costs of
development, which can vary over time due to labor and material cost increases, master plan design
changes and regulatory modifications. Accordingly, allocations are subject to change based on
factors which are in many instances beyond management&#146;s control. Future margins will continue to
vary based on these and other market factors. If conditions in the real estate markets do not
improve or deteriorate further, we may not be able to sell land at prices above our carrying cost
or even in amounts necessary to repay our indebtedness.

31, 2008, compared to $16.6&nbsp;million in 2007. Sales of real estate in Tradition, Florida for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 consisted of the sale of 31 acres generating revenues of $8.0&nbsp;million,
net of deferred revenue, as compared to the sale of 37 acres generating revenues of $12.7&nbsp;million,
net of deferred revenue, in 2007. In addition, in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, we sold 11
lots encompassing approximately 4 acres in Tradition Hilton Head, recognizing revenues of $1.1
million, net of deferred revenue, compared to the sale of 9 residential lots encompassing
approximately 3 acres, recognizing revenues of $1.1&nbsp;million, net of deferred revenue, in 2007. In
addition, revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 included &#147;look back&#148; revenue of $145,000
compared to $1.5&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. &#147;Look back&#148; revenue relates to
incremental revenue received from homebuilders based on the final resale price to the homebuilder&#146;s
customer. We also recognized deferred revenue on previously sold bulk land and residential lots
totaling approximately $1.9&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, compared to recognition
of deferred revenue of approximately $1.3&nbsp;million in 2007. These amounts included approximately
$159,000 and $733,000 in 2008 and 2007, respectively, of intercompany sales in prior periods and
were eliminated in consolidation.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other revenues increased approximately $3.0 to $10.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2008, compared to $7.6&nbsp;million during 2007. The increase was primarily the result of higher leasing
revenues associated with the opening of the Landing at Tradition retail power center in late 2007.
This increase was offset in part by decreased marketing income associated with Tradition, Florida.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of sales decreased $815,000 to $6.6&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, as
compared to $7.4&nbsp;million in 2007 due to the decrease in sales of real estate. Costs of sales for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 represents the costs associated with the sale of approximately 35
acres of land compared to the costs associated with the sale of approximately 40 acres in 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margin percentage decreased to 41.1% in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 from 55.0% in the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. The decrease in margin is attributable to a decrease in the average
sales price per acre and less &#147;lookback revenue&#148; recognized in 2008 compared to 2007. &#147;Lookback
revenue&#148; margin percentage is 100% because the associated costs were fully expensed at the time of
closing.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $24.6&nbsp;million during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared to $19.1&nbsp;million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to higher
other administrative expenses associated with increased marketing activities in Tradition Hilton
Head, higher repairs and maintenance expenses related to damages from tropical storms and higher
depreciation expense associated with the South Carolina irrigation facility placed in service in
2008 and a depreciation recapture as a result of the reclassification of discontinued operations.
Additionally, we incurred higher property management expenses related to our commercial leasing
activities, higher compensation and benefits expenses, higher expenses associated with our support
of the community and commercial associations in our master-planned communities and higher property
tax expense due to the completion of certain projects in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared
to 2007. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in incentives and commissions expense.

million, respectively, while interest capitalized totaled $8.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December
31, 2008 compared to $11.8&nbsp;million during 2007. This resulted in interest expense of $3.6&nbsp;million
in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, compared to $2.6&nbsp;million in 2007. The interest expense in the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 of approximately $3.6&nbsp;million mainly related to $1.1&nbsp;million of
interest expense associated with an intercompany loan with the Parent Company from funds borrowed
by Core and approximately $2.5&nbsp;million due to the completion of certain phases of
development associated with our real estate inventory which resulted in a decreased amount of

31, 2007 of approximately $2.6&nbsp;million was attributable to the intercompany loan mentioned above.
The capitalization of this interest occurred at the Parent Company level and all intercompany
interest expense and income was eliminated in consolidation. Interest incurred was lower in 2008
due to decreases in the average interest rates on our notes and mortgage notes payable, partly
offset by higher average debt balances for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared to 2007. At
the time of land sales, the capitalized interest allocated to such inventory is charged to cost of
sales. Cost of sales of real estate for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007 included
previously capitalized interest of approximately $84,000 and $66,000, respectively.

$4.5&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. Interest and other income increased primarily
due to a $2.5&nbsp;million gain on sale of property and equipment and higher forfeited deposits in 2008
compared to 2007. The increase was partially offset by lower intercompany interest income related
to the intercompany loan mentioned above.

year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 consisted of the sale of 37 acres generating revenues of $12.7
million, net of deferred revenue, as compared to the sale of 208 acres generating revenues of
$51.2&nbsp;million in 2006. In 2007, demand for residential land in Tradition, Florida slowed
dramatically. In addition, in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, we sold 9 residential lots
encompassing approximately 3 acres in Tradition Hilton Head generating revenues of $1.1&nbsp;million,
net of deferred revenue, compared to sales to third parties in Tradition Hilton Head encompassing
10 acres generating revenues of $4.7&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and an additional
150 acres transferred to Carolina Oak which was eliminated in consolidation. In addition,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other revenues increased approximately $3.8&nbsp;million to $7.6&nbsp;million for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007, compared to $3.8&nbsp;million during 2006. This was due to increased revenues
related to irrigation services provided to homebuilders, commercial users and the residents of
Tradition, Florida, marketing income associated with Tradition, Florida, and leasing revenues
associated with our commercial leasing business.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of sales decreased $35.2&nbsp;million to $7.4&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007,
as compared to $42.7&nbsp;million for the same period in 2006 due to the decrease in sales of real
estate.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margin percentage increased to 55.0% in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 from 38.9% in the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. The increase in margin was primarily due to increased commercial
sales in 2007 which generated a higher margin and 100% margin percentage being realized on
&#147;lookback&#148; revenue because the associated costs were fully expensed at the time of closing.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $19.1&nbsp;million during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007 compared to $15.1&nbsp;million in the same period in 2006. The increase was the
result of higher employee compensation and benefits, increased operating costs associated with the
commercial leasing business and increased other general and administrative costs. The number of
full time employees increased to 67 at December&nbsp;31, 2007, from 59 at December&nbsp;31, 2006, as
additional personnel were added to support development activity in Tradition Hilton Head. General
and administrative costs increased due to increased expenses associated with our commercial leasing
activities, increased legal expenditures, increased insurance costs and increased marketing and
advertising expenditures designed to attract buyers in Florida and establish a market presence in
South Carolina.

to Woodbridge. The capitalization of this interest occurred at the consolidated level and all
intercompany interest expense and income was eliminated on a consolidated basis. As noted above,
interest incurred was higher due to higher outstanding balances of notes and mortgage notes payable
and an increase in the average interest rate on variable-rate debt. At the time of land sales, the
capitalized interest allocated to such inventory is charged to cost of sales. Cost of sales of real
estate for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006 included previously capitalized interest of
approximately $66,000 and $443,000, respectively.

2006, to $4.5&nbsp;million during 2007. Interest and other income increased primarily due to higher
intercompany interest income associated with the aforementioned intercompany loan to Woodbridge
which was eliminated in consolidation. The increase was partially offset by a gain on sale of fixed
assets which totaled $1.3&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 compared to $20,000 in 2007.

Pizza Fusion, other activities through Cypress Creek Capital and Snapper Creek, an equity
investment in Bluegreen and an investment in Office Depot. We currently own approximately 9.5
million shares of the common stock of Bluegreen, which represents approximately 31% of Bluegreen&#146;s
outstanding shares as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. Under equity method accounting, we recognize our
pro-rata share of Bluegreen&#146;s net income (net of purchase accounting adjustments) as pre-tax
earnings. Bluegreen has not paid dividends to its shareholders; therefore, our earnings represent
only our claim to the future distributions of Bluegreen&#146;s earnings. Accordingly, we record a tax
liability on our portion of Bluegreen&#146;s net income. Our earnings in Bluegreen increase or decrease
concurrently with Bluegreen&#146;s reported results. Furthermore, a significant reduction in Bluegreen&#146;s
financial position could potentially result in additional impairment charges on our investment
against our future results of operations. For a complete
discussion of Bluegreen&#146;s results of operations and financial position, we refer you to the
financial statements of Bluegreen which are filed as Exhibit&nbsp;99.1 to this Form 10-K.

delivery of 8 units in Carolina Oak, compared to sales of real estate of $6.6&nbsp;million in 2007
reflecting the delivery of 17 units at Levitt Commercial. There were no units in backlog at
December&nbsp;31, 2008 or December&nbsp;31, 2007. Levitt Commercial completed the sale of all remaining flex
warehouse units in inventory in 2007 and ceased development activities thereafter.

2007. The increase was due to an increase in leasing revenues.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of sales of real estate in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 was $16.2&nbsp;million compared to
$16.8&nbsp;million in 2007. Cost of sales of real estate for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 related to
the delivery of 8 units in Carolina Oak and a $3.5&nbsp;million impairment charge related to Carolina
Oak&#146;s inventory of real estate while cost of sales of real estate in 2007 was comprised of the cost
of sales of the 17 units delivered in Levitt Commercial, the expensing of interest previously
capitalized and capitalized interest impairment charges related to the cessation of development on
certain Levitt and Sons&#146; projects.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen reported a net loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 of $516,000, as compared to
net income of $31.9&nbsp;million in 2007. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, our interest in
Bluegreen&#146;s income was $9.0&nbsp;million (after the amortization of approximately $9.2&nbsp;million related
to the change in the basis as a result of the impairment charge at September&nbsp;30, 2008), compared to
$10.3&nbsp;million in 2007. We review our investment in Bluegreen for impairment on a quarterly basis or
as events or circumstances warrant for other-than-temporary declines in value. Based on the
evaluations performed, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $53.6&nbsp;million at
September&nbsp;30, 2008 and an additional other-than-temporary impairment charge of $40.8&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2008. See (Note 10) to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item
8 for further details of the impairment analysis of our investment in Bluegreen.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $5.8&nbsp;million to $26.7&nbsp;million during
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared to $32.5&nbsp;million in 2007. The decrease was attributable
to decreased compensation and benefits expenses, decreased office related expenses and decreased
severance charges related to the reductions in workforce associated with the bankruptcy filing of
Levitt and Sons. The decrease in compensation, benefits and office related expenses is attributable
to decreased headcount, as the number of employees decreased from 47 at December&nbsp;31, 2007 to 29 at
December&nbsp;31, 2008. These decreases were offset in part by increases in professional fees
associated with our investments and the bankruptcy filing of Levitt and Sons, and increased
insurance costs due to the absorption of certain of Levitt and Sons&#146; insurance costs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest incurred was approximately $11.5&nbsp;million and $10.8&nbsp;million for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, while interest capitalized totaled $3.2&nbsp;million for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared to $9.8&nbsp;million during 2007. This resulted in interest
expense of $8.3&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, compared to $1.1&nbsp;million in 2007. The
increase in interest expense was due to the completion of certain phases of development associated
with our real estate inventory late in 2007, which resulted in a decreased amount of assets which
qualified for interest capitalization and, therefore, the expensing of the related interest was
only recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the full year of 2008. The increase in
interest incurred was attributable to higher average debt balances for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2008 compared to 2007, offset in part by lower average interest rates. Cost of sales of real estate
in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 included previously capitalized interest of approximately
$242,000, which primarily related to the delivery of 8 units in Carolina Oak, compared to
approximately $250,000 in 2007 related to the delivery of 17 units in Levitt Commercial.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not incur other expenses in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. Other expenses for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 were $2.4&nbsp;million and consisted of a surety bonds accrual and a
write-off of leasehold improvements. In 2007, we recorded $1.8&nbsp;million in surety bonds accrual
related to certain bonds where
management considered it probable that reimbursement of the surety under the applicable
indemnity agreement would be required. In addition to the surety bond accrual, we also recorded a
write-off of leasehold improvements as

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest and other income was approximately $4.0&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008
compared to $7.4&nbsp;million in 2007. This decrease was primarily the result of our realization of
interest income related to intersegment loans to the Primary and Tennessee Homebuilding segments in
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 which was eliminated in consolidation, whereas no comparable
interest income was realized during 2008.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of sales of real estate increased to $16.8&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2007, as compared to $11.6&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 due to an increase of
$9.3&nbsp;million in capitalized interest impairment charges. This increase was offset in part by a
decrease of $3.8&nbsp;million in cost of sales related to fewer deliveries of commercial warehouse
units, as we delivered 12 fewer flex warehouse units in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 as
compared to 2006. In addition, interest in Other Operations is amortized to cost of sales in
accordance with the relief rate used in the Company&#146;s operating segments, and due to the lower
sales in 2007, the operating segments experienced decreased interest amortization which resulted in
less amortization by the Other Operations segment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluegreen reported net income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 of $31.9&nbsp;million, as
compared to net income of $29.8&nbsp;million in 2006. In the first quarter of 2006, Bluegreen adopted
SOP 04-02 and recorded a one-time, non-cash, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
charge of $4.5&nbsp;million, which contributed to the slight increase in 2007. Our interest in
Bluegreen&#146;s income was $10.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 compared to $9.7&nbsp;million
in 2006.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.3&nbsp;million to $32.5&nbsp;million during
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 compared to $28.2&nbsp;million in 2006. The increase was attributable
to $5.1&nbsp;million of restructuring related charges associated with Woodbridge and Levitt and Sons
employees. In the third and fourth quarters of 2007, substantially all of Levitt and Sons&#146;
employees were terminated and 22 employees were terminated at Woodbridge primarily as a result of
the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. Woodbridge recorded approximately $2.4&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2007 of severance benefits to terminated Levitt and Sons employees to supplement the limited
termination benefits which could be paid by Levitt and Sons to those employees. The restructuring
related expenses were slightly offset by lower stock based compensation and annual incentive
compensation expense as a result of the multiple reductions in force that occurred in 2007 and
significant operating losses in 2007. The decrease in non-cash stock based compensation expense
was attributable to the large number of employee terminations that occurred in 2007 which resulted
in a reversal of stock compensation amounts previously accrued. The reversal related to forfeited
options in connection with the terminations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest incurred in Other Operations was approximately $10.8&nbsp;million and $7.4&nbsp;million for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. While all interest was capitalized in the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, $9.8&nbsp;million was capitalized in 2007 due to a decreased level of
development associated with a portion of our real estate inventory which resulted in a decreased
amount of qualified assets for interest capitalization. The increase in interest incurred was
attributable to an increase in the average balance of our borrowings as a result of our issuance of
trust preferred securities during 2006, and the aforementioned funds borrowed by Core Communities
but then loaned to Woodbridge.

recorded a write-off of leasehold improvements which also did not exist in 2006. As part of the
reductions in force discussed above and the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases, we vacated certain leased space.
Leasehold improvements in the amount of $564,000 related to this vacated space will not be
recovered and were written off in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest and other income was approximately $7.4&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007
compared to $4.1&nbsp;million in 2006. This increase was primarily the result of the Rights Offering we
completed in October&nbsp;2007, the proceeds of which resulted in higher average cash balances at the
Parent Company in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 which generated higher interest income, as well
as interest income related to intersegment loans to the Primary and Tennessee Homebuilding segments
which were eliminated in consolidation.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of real estate decreased to $345.7&nbsp;million during the year ended December
31, 2007, from $424.4&nbsp;million during 2006 despite the increase in average sales price of deliveries
from $322,000 in 2006 to $338,000 in 2007. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, 998 homes were
delivered compared to 1,320 homes delivered during 2006. The decrease in units delivered was
partially offset by increased land sales. We recognized $8.0&nbsp;million of revenue attributable to
the sale of land that management decided not to develop further, while there were no land sales in
2006.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other revenues decreased $1.8&nbsp;million to $2.2&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007,
compared to $4.1&nbsp;million during 2006. Other revenues in the Primary Homebuilding segment decreased
due to lower revenues from our title company due to fewer closings.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of sales increased to $501.2&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, compared to
$367.3&nbsp;million for 2006. The increase was primarily due to the increased impairment charges on
inventory of real estate and an increase in cost of sales associated with the land sale that
occurred in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 slightly offset by a decrease in cost of sales due to
a fewer number of deliveries. Impairment charges were $206.4&nbsp;million in the year ended December
31, 2007 compared to $31.1&nbsp;million in impairment charges in 2006.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margin percentage (defined as sales of real estate minus cost of sales of real estate, divided
by sales of real estate) declined to a negative 45.0% in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 from
13.5% in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 mainly attributable to the impairment charges recorded in
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. Margin percentage excluding impairments declined from 20.8% in
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 to 14.7% during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. This decline
was primarily attributable to significant discounts offered in an effort to reduce cancellations
and to encourage buyers to close, and aggressive pricing discounts on spec units as well as lower
margin earned on the $8.0&nbsp;million land sale mentioned above.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $61.6&nbsp;million during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007, compared to $65.1&nbsp;million in 2006 primarily as a result of lower employee
compensation and benefits expense and decreased office and administrative expenses as a result of
the multiple reductions in force that occurred in 2007. In addition, no annual incentive
compensation was recorded in 2007 for the Primary Homebuilding segment. In addition, Levitt and
Sons was deconsolidated as of November&nbsp;9, 2007 and the selling, general and administrative expenses
of Levitt and Sons were reflected through November&nbsp;9, 2007 compared to a full year of selling,
general and administrative expenses in 2006. These decreases were offset in part by increased
legal costs primarily related to the preparation of the Levitt and Sons bankruptcy filing. As a
percentage of total revenues, selling, general and administrative expense was approximately 17.7%
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 compared to 15.2% in 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest incurred totaled $31.2&nbsp;million and $27.2&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31,

to such inventory was charged to cost of sales. Cost of sales of real estate for the years ended

million in 2006 as a result of a decrease in title and mortgage expense. Title and mortgage
expense mostly relates to closing costs and title insurance costs for closings processed
internally. These costs were lower in 2007 due to the decrease in closings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest and other income increased from $3.0&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006
to $6.9&nbsp;million during 2007 mainly as a result of an increase in forfeited deposits of $3.5&nbsp;million
resulting from increased cancellations of home sale contracts.

the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 due to the deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons from our

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues from sales of real estate decreased to $42.0&nbsp;million during the year ended December
31, 2007, from $76.3&nbsp;million during 2006. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, 146 homes were
delivered at an average sales price of $205,000 as compared to 340 homes delivered at an average
price of $224,000 during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. The average sales prices of homes
delivered in 2007 declined due to the product mix sold, discounts on deliveries, and aggressive
pricing on spec sales. This decrease was offset by an increase of $11.1&nbsp;million of revenue
recognized related to a land sale that occurred in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 related to
property that management decided to not develop further. There were no land sales in 2006.
Additionally, included in revenues are certain lot sales occurring in the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of sales of real estate decreased to $51.4&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2007, as compared to $72.8&nbsp;million during 2006 due to a decrease in home deliveries. The decrease
in home deliveries was offset by increased impairment charges related to inventory, and increased
cost of sales associated with land sales. Included in cost of sales in the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2007 was $11.1&nbsp;million associated with land sales. There were no land sales in 2006. In
addition, impairment charges increased $5.5&nbsp;million from $5.7&nbsp;million in the year ended December
31, 2006 to $11.2&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margin percentage decreased to a negative margin of 22.2% in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007
from 4.6% in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. The decrease in margin percentage was primarily
attributable to impairment charges, which increased by $5.5&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2007 compared to 2006. Margin percentage excluding impairment charges declined from 12.0% during
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 to 4.6% during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 due to the mix of
homes delivered with lower average selling prices and minimal to no margin being generated on the
land or lot sales that occurred during the period.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $7.8&nbsp;million to $5.0&nbsp;million during the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 compared to $12.8&nbsp;million during 2006 primarily as a result of lower
employee compensation and benefits, decreased broker commission costs and decreased advertising and
marketing costs. The decrease in employee compensation and benefits was mainly a result of the
multiple reductions in force that occurred in 2007 in connection with the filing of the Levitt and
Sons bankruptcy. Decreased broker commission costs were due to lower revenues generated in the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 compared to 2006 and the decreases associated with marketing and
advertising are attributable to a decreased focus in 2007 on advertising in the Tennessee market.
In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses related to the Tennessee Homebuilding
segment are reflected through November&nbsp;9, 2007 compared to a full year of selling, general and
administrative expenses in 2006. These decreases were offset in part by increased severance
related expense related to Tennessee employees, payroll taxes and other benefits associated with
the terminations that occurred in 2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest incurred totaled $1.9&nbsp;million and $2.7&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007
and 2006, respectively. While all interest was capitalized during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2006, $1.8&nbsp;million in interest was capitalized during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 due to the
decreased level of development in the projects in this segment in 2007 which resulted in less
assets being qualified for interest capitalization. Interest incurred decreased as a result of
lower average debt balances for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 as compared to 2006. At the time
of home closings and land sales, the capitalized interest allocated to such inventory was charged
to cost of sales. Cost of sales of real estate for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006
included previously capitalized interest of approximately $1.3&nbsp;million and $2.1&nbsp;million,
respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no other expenses in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 compared to $1.3&nbsp;million in
2006. Other expenses in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 reflected the write-off of $1.3&nbsp;million in
goodwill related to the Bowden acquisition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management assesses our liquidity in terms of our cash and cash equivalent balances and our
ability to generate cash to fund our operating and investment activities. During the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008, our primary sources of funds were the proceeds from the sale of real estate
inventory, borrowings from financial institutions and an income tax refund. We separately manage
our liquidity at the Parent Company level and at the operating subsidiary level. Subsidiary
operations, consisting primarily of Core Communities&#146; operations, are generally financed using
proceeds from sales of real estate inventory and debt financing using land or other developed
assets as loan collateral. Many of the financing agreements contain covenants at the subsidiary
level. Parent Company guarantees are provided only in limited circumstances and, when provided, are
generally provided on a limited basis. We intend to use available cash and our borrowing capacity
to pursue development of our master-planned communities and to pursue investments generally. We are
also exploring ways to monetize a portion of our investment in certain of Core&#146;s assets through
joint ventures or other strategic relationships, including the possible sale of such assets. We
have historically utilized community development districts to fund development costs at
Core when possible. We also will use available cash to repay borrowings and to pay operating
expenses.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, Woodbridge had cash of $107.3&nbsp;million and $162.0&nbsp;million,
respectively. Our cash decreased by $54.7&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008
primarily due to the repayment of a $40.0&nbsp;million intercompany loan to Core, the acquisition (net
of shares sold) of 1,435,000 shares of Office Depot common stock for an aggregate cost (net of
proceeds received from shares sold) of $16.3&nbsp;million, severance related payments of approximately
$4.9&nbsp;million, a $3.0&nbsp;million investment in Pizza Fusion and an increase in restricted cash of $16.4
million primarily related to funding the Levitt and Sons Settlement Agreement, and providing $4.3
million as collateral for a letter of credit. These decreases were offset in part by the receipt of
approximately $29.7&nbsp;million of a federal income tax refund and the receipt from Core of a $30.0
million cash dividend payment. The remaining balance was used in operations and to pay accrued
expenses.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2007, Woodbridge acquired from Levitt and Sons all of the membership interests in
Carolina Oak, which owns a 150 acre parcel in Tradition Hilton Head. In connection with this
acquisition, the credit facility collateralized by the 150 acre parcel (the &#147;Carolina Oak Loan&#148;)
was modified, and Woodbridge became the obligor under the Carolina Oak Loan. Woodbridge was
previously a guarantor of this loan and as partial consideration for Woodbridge becoming the
obligor of the Carolina Oak Loan, its membership interests in Levitt and Sons, previously pledged
by Woodbridge to the lender, was released. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the outstanding balance on the
Carolina Oak Loan was $37.5&nbsp;million. The loan is collateralized by a first mortgage on the 150 acre
parcel in Tradition Hilton Head and guaranteed by Carolina Oak. The Carolina Oak Loan is due and
payable on March&nbsp;21, 2011 but may be extended for one additional year at the discretion of the
lender. Interest accrues under the facility at the Prime Rate (3.25% at December&nbsp;31, 2008) and is
payable monthly. The Carolina Oak Loan is subject to customary terms, conditions and covenants,
including periodic appraisal and re-margining and the lender&#146;s right to accelerate the debt upon a
material adverse change with respect to Woodbridge. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, there was no immediate
availability to draw on this facility based on available collateral, and we were in compliance with
the loan covenants.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At November&nbsp;9, 2007, the date of the deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons, Woodbridge had a
negative investment in Levitt and Sons of $123.0&nbsp;million and there were outstanding advances due to
Woodbridge from Levitt and Sons of $67.8&nbsp;million, resulting in a net negative investment of $55.2
million. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company identified approximately $2.3&nbsp;million of
deferred revenue on intercompany sales between Core and Carolina Oak that had been misclassified
against the negative investment in Levitt and Sons. As a result, the Company recorded a $2.3
million reclassification between inventory of real estate and the loss in excess of investment in
subsidiary in the consolidated statements of financial condition. As a result, as of December&nbsp;31,
2008, the net negative investment was $52.9&nbsp;million. After the filing of the Levitt and Sons&#146;
bankruptcy, Woodbridge incurred certain administrative costs relating to services performed for
Levitt and Sons and its employees (the &#147;Post Petition Services&#148;) in the amounts of $1.6&nbsp;million and
$748,000 in the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, the Debtors
asserted certain claims against Woodbridge, including an entitlement to a portion of the $29.7
million federal tax refund which Woodbridge received as a consequence of losses experienced at
Levitt and Sons in prior periods; however, the parties entered into the Settlement Agreement
described below which resolved this issue.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;27, 2008, Woodbridge entered into the Settlement Agreement with the Debtors and the
Joint Committee appointed in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, among
other things, (i)&nbsp;Woodbridge agreed to pay to the Debtors&#146; bankruptcy estates the sum of $12.5
million plus accrued interest from May&nbsp;22, 2008 through the date of payment, (ii)&nbsp;Woodbridge agreed
to waive and release substantially all of the claims it has against the Debtors, including its
administrative expense claims through July&nbsp;2008, and (iii)&nbsp;the
Debtors (joined by the Joint Committee) agreed to waive and release any claims they may have
against Woodbridge and its affiliates. After certain of Levitt and Sons&#146; creditors indicated that

against Woodbridge, Woodbridge, the Debtors and the Joint Committee agreed in principal to an
amendment to the Settlement Agreement, pursuant to which Woodbridge would, in lieu of the
previously agreed $12.5&nbsp;million payment, pay $8&nbsp;million to the Debtors&#146; bankruptcy estates and
place $4.5&nbsp;million in a release fund to be disbursed to third party creditors in exchange for a
third party release and injunction. The amendment also provided for an additional $300,000 payment
to a deposit holders fund. The Settlement Agreement, as amended, was subject to a number of
conditions, including the approval of the Bankruptcy Court. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the settlement
amount was classified as restricted cash. On February&nbsp;20, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court presiding over
Levitt and Sons&#146; Chapter&nbsp;11 bankruptcy case entered an order confirming a plan of liquidation
jointly proposed by Levitt and Sons and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. That order
also approved the settlement pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, as amended. No appeal or
rehearing of the court&#146;s order was timely filed by any party, and the settlement was consummated on
March&nbsp;3, 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We effected a one-for-five reverse stock split during the third quarter of 2008 which
converted each five shares of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock into one share of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and
each five shares of our Class&nbsp;B Common Stock into one share of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock. The reverse
stock split proportionately reduced the number of authorized shares and the number of outstanding
shares of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, but did not have any impact on our
shareholders&#146; proportionate equity interests or voting rights in the Company. We pursued the
reverse stock split based on the continued listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange.
While the reverse stock split was effected for the purpose of addressing issues with respect to the
trading price of our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and our compliance with the New York Stock Exchange&#146;s
continued listing requirements, our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock ultimately failed to meet the New York
Stock Exchange&#146;s continued listing requirement regarding average market capitalization over a
consecutive thirty-day trading period. As a result, our Class&nbsp;A Common Stock was suspended from
trading on the New York Stock Exchange beginning with the opening of trading on November&nbsp;20, 2008.

million, respectively. Cash decreased $16.2&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008
primarily as a result of a $30.0&nbsp;million dividend payment to the Parent Company, an increase in
restricted cash of $2.7&nbsp;million mainly related to the funding of an interest reserve, $19.9&nbsp;million
of curtailment payments mentioned below and cash used to fund the continued development at Core&#146;s
projects as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. These decreases were partially
offset by Core&#146;s receipt of $40.0&nbsp;million from the Parent Company as a repayment of an intercompany
loan. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, Core had no immediate availability under its various lines of credit.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant land development expenditures
in both Tradition, Florida and in Tradition Hilton Head. Tradition Hilton Head is in the early
stage of the master-planned community&#146;s development cycle and significant investments have been
made and will be required in the future to develop the community infrastructure. Sales in Tradition
Hilton Head have been limited to golf course lots sold to various builders and an intercompany land
sale in December&nbsp;2006<I>. </I>Recent investments in Tradition, Florida have been primarily to build
infrastructure to support the master-planned community and the sale of various commercial land
parcels. The current investment in land and development, as well as property and equipment has
been financed primarily through a combination of secured borrowings, which totaled $212.0&nbsp;million
at December&nbsp;31, 2008, and proceeds from bonds issued by community development districts and special
assessment districts which support the development of infrastructure improvements while burdening
the developed property with long-term tax assessments. This financing at December&nbsp;31, 2008
consisted of district bonds totaling $218.7&nbsp;million with approximately $130.5&nbsp;million currently
outstanding and approximately $82.4&nbsp;million available to fund future development expenditures.
These bonds are further discussed below in &#147;Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual
Obligations&#148;. We expect that the availability of tax-exempt bond financing to fund infrastructure
development at our master-planned communities could be adversely affected by the disruptions in
credit markets, including the municipal bond market, by general economic conditions and by
fluctuations in the real estate market. If we are not able to access this type of financing, we
would pursue substitute financing, which may not be available
on favorable terms, or at all. If we are not able to obtain financing for infrastructure
development, we would be forced to use our own funds or delay development activity at our
master-planned communities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2008, Core refinanced $9.1&nbsp;million of construction loans. The new loan has an
interest rate of 30-day LIBOR plus 210 basis points or Prime Rate (current rate at December&nbsp;31,
2008 was Prime Rate of 3.25%) and a maturity date of July&nbsp;2010 with a one year extension subject to
certain conditions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core&#146;s loan agreements generally require repayment of specified amounts upon a sale of a
portion of the property collateralizing the debt. Core was subject to provisions in one of its
loan agreements collateralized by land in Tradition Hilton Head that require additional principal
payments, known as curtailment payments, in the event that actual sales are below the contractual
requirements. A curtailment payment of $14.9&nbsp;million relating to Tradition Hilton Head was paid in
January&nbsp;2008. In June&nbsp;2008, Core modified this loan agreement, terminating the revolving feature of
the loan and reducing an approximately $19&nbsp;million curtailment payment due in June&nbsp;2008 to $17.0
million, $5.0&nbsp;million of which was paid in June&nbsp;2008. The loan was further modified in December
2008, reducing the loan to $25&nbsp;million, eliminating the curtailment requirements, extending the
loan to February&nbsp;2012 and increasing the interest rate to Prime Rate plus 1%, with a floor of 5.00%
(the interest rate was 5% as of December&nbsp;31, 2008) and the establishment of an interest reserve
classified as restricted cash.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loans, which provide the primary financing for Tradition, Florida and Tradition Hilton
Head, have annual appraisal and re-margining requirements. These provisions may require Core, in
circumstances where the value of the real estate collateralizing these loans declines, to pay down
a portion of the principal amount of the loan to bring the loan within specified minimum
loan-to-value ratios. Accordingly, should land prices decline, reappraisals could result in
significant future re-margining payments. Additionally, the loans which provide the primary
financing for the commercial leasing projects contain certain debt service coverage ratio
covenants. If net operating income from these projects falls below levels necessary to maintain
compliance with these covenants, Core would be required to make principal curtailment payments
sufficient to reduce the loan balance to an amount which would bring Core into compliance with the
requirement, and these curtailment payments could be significant.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January of 2009, Core was advised by one of its lenders that they had received an external
appraisal on the land that serves as collateral for a development mortgage note payable with an
outstanding balance of $86.9&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008. The appraised value would suggest the
potential for a remargining payment to bring the note payable back in line with the minimum
loan-to-value requirement. The lender is conducting their internal review procedures of the
appraisal, including the determination of the appraised value. As of the date of this filing, the
lender&#146;s evaluation is continuing and until such time as there is final conclusion on the part of
the lender, the amount of a possible re-margin, if any, is not determinable.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of Core&#146;s debt facilities contain financial covenants generally requiring certain net
worth, liquidity and loan to value ratios. Further, Core&#146;s debt facilities contain cross-default
provisions under which a default on one loan with a lender could cause a default on other debt
instruments with the same lender. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, Core was in compliance with these financial
covenants; however, there is no assurance that Core will remain in compliance in future periods. If
Core fails to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants, the lenders under the applicable
debt facilities could cause Core&#146;s debt to become due and payable prior to maturity. These
accelerations or significant re-margining payments could require Core to dedicate a substantial
portion of its cash to payment of its debt and reduce its ability to use its cash to fund
operations or investments. If Core does not have sufficient cash to satisfy these required
payments, then Core would need to seek to refinance the debt or seek other funds, which may not be
available on attractive terms, if at all. Possible liquidity sources available to Core include the
sale of real estate inventory, including commercial properties, debt or outside equity financing,
including secured borrowings using unencumbered land. While funding from Woodbridge is a possible
source of liquidity, Woodbridge is under no obligation to provide funding to Core and there can be
no assurance that it will do so.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the overall condition of the homebuilding industry in Florida and the current oversupply
of single-family residential land in the St. Lucie market, we do not expect any meaningful
single-family residential land sales by Core in the near future. Management efforts will be
focused on commercial and other land sales in Florida and Hilton Head. Core&#146;s business may not
generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available under its
existing credit facilities or any other financing sources in an amount sufficient to enable Core
to service its indebtedness, or to fund its other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance
all or a portion of Core&#146;s debt on or before maturity, which we may not be able to do on favorable
terms or at all. Recent disruptions in the

Core would need to fund community infrastructure development out of operating cash flow or through
sources of financing or capital, or be forced to delay its development activity. The obligation to
pay principal and interest on the bonds issued by the districts is assigned to each parcel within
the district, and a priority assessment lien may be placed on benefited parcels to provide security
for the debt service. The bonds, including interest and redemption premiums, if any, and the
associated priority lien on the property are typically payable, secured and satisfied by revenues,
fees, or assessments levied on the property benefited. Core pays a portion of the revenues, fees,
and assessments levied by the districts on the properties it still owns that are benefited by the
improvements. Core may also be required to pay down a specified portion of the bonds at the time
each unit or parcel is sold. The costs of these obligations are capitalized to inventory during the

Bond obligations at December&nbsp;31, 2008 mature in 2035 and 2040. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, Core
Communities owned approximately 16% of the property subject to assessments within the community
development district and approximately 91% of the property subject to assessments within the
special assessment district. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, Core
recorded approximately $584,000, $1.3&nbsp;million and $1.7&nbsp;million, respectively, in assessments on
property owned by it in the districts. Core is responsible for any assessed amounts until the
underlying property is sold and will continue to be responsible for the annual assessments if the
property is never sold. Accordingly, if the current adverse conditions in the homebuilding
industry do not improve and Core is forced to hold its land inventory longer than originally
projected, Core would be forced to pay a higher portion of annual assessments on property which is
subject to assessments. In addition, Core has guaranteed payments for assessments under the
district bonds in Tradition, Florida which would require funding if future assessments to be
allocated to property owners are insufficient to repay the bonds. Management has evaluated this
exposure based upon the criteria in SFAS No.&nbsp;5, <I>&#147;Accounting for Contingencies&#148;</I>, and has determined
that there have been no substantive changes to the projected density or land use in the development
subject to the bond which would make it probable that Core would have to fund future shortfalls in
assessments.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.&nbsp;91-10, <I>&#147;Accounting for Special
Assessments and Tax Increment Financing&#148;</I>, we record a liability for the estimated developer
obligations that are fixed and determinable and user fees that are required to be paid or
transferred at the time the parcel or unit is sold to an end user. At December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007,
the liability related to developer obligations was $3.3&nbsp;million and is included in the accompanying
consolidated statement of financial condition as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, and includes
amounts associated with Core&#146;s ownership of the property.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We entered into an indemnity agreement in April&nbsp;2004 with a joint venture partner at Altman
Longleaf relating to, among other obligations, that partner&#146;s guarantee of the joint venture&#146;s
indebtedness. Our liability under the indemnity agreement was limited to the amount of any
distributions from the joint venture which exceeds our original capital and other contributions.
Levitt Commercial owned a 20% interest in Altman Longleaf, LLC, which owned a 20% interest in this
joint venture. This joint venture developed a 298-unit apartment complex in Melbourne, Florida. An
affiliate of our joint venture partner was the general contractor. Construction commenced on the
development in 2004 and was completed in 2006. Our original capital contributions totaled
approximately $585,000 and we have received approximately $1.2&nbsp;million in distributions since 2004.
In December&nbsp;2008, our interest in the joint venture was sold and we received approximately $182,000
as a result of the sale. Accordingly, we were released from any potential obligation of indemnity which may have arisen in
connection with the joint venture.

development and construction obligations amount to $5.2&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008, which are
expected to be incurred over the next two years. The timing of future development will depend on

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levitt and Sons had $33.3&nbsp;million in surety bonds related to its ongoing projects at the time
of the filing of the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. In the event that these obligations are drawn and paid by
the surety, Woodbridge could be responsible for up to $11.7&nbsp;million plus costs and expenses in
accordance with the surety indemnity agreements executed by Woodbridge. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and
2007, we had $1.1&nbsp;million and $1.8&nbsp;million, respectively, in surety bonds accruals at Woodbridge
related to certain bonds which management considers it to be probable that Woodbridge will be
required to reimburse the surety under applicable indemnity agreements. During the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008, Woodbridge performed under its indemnity agreements and reimbursed the surety
$532,000 while no reimbursements were made in 2007. It is unclear given the uncertainty involved in
the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases whether and to what extent the remaining outstanding surety bonds of Levitt
and Sons will be drawn and the extent to which Woodbridge may be responsible for additional amounts
beyond this accrual. There is no assurance that Woodbridge will not be responsible for amounts
well in excess of the $1.1&nbsp;million accrual. It is considered unlikely that Woodbridge will receive
any repayment, assets or other consideration as recovery of any amounts it may be required to pay.
In September&nbsp;2008, a surety filed a lawsuit to require Woodbridge to post $5.4&nbsp;million of
collateral against a portion of the $11.7&nbsp;million surety bonds exposure in connection with two
bonds totaling $5.4&nbsp;million with respect to which a municipality made claims against the surety. We
believe that the municipality does not have the right to demand payment under the bonds and we
initiated a lawsuit against the municipality and do not believe that a loss is probable.
Accordingly, we did not accrue any amount related to this claim as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. Since
claims were made on the bonds, the surety requested that Woodbridge post a $4.0&nbsp;million letter of
credit as security while the matter is litigated with the municipality and we have complied with
that request.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;9, 2007, Woodbridge put in place an employee fund and offered up to $5&nbsp;million of
severance benefits to terminated Levitt and Sons employees to supplement the limited termination
benefits paid by Levitt and Sons to those employees. Levitt and Sons was restricted in the payment
of termination benefits to its former employees by virtue of the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. Woodbridge
incurred severance and benefits related restructuring charges of approximately $2.2&nbsp;million during
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company paid
approximately $4.1&nbsp;million in severance and termination charges related to the above described fund
as well as severance for employees other than Levitt and Sons employees. Employees entitled to
participate in the fund either received a payment stream, which in certain cases extends over two
years, or a lump sum payment, dependent on a variety of factors. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, $129,000
was accrued to be paid with respect to this employee fund and the severance accrual for our other
employees and is included under &#147;Severance related termination obligations&#148; in the table above.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The independent contractor related expense relates to two contractor agreements entered into
with former Levitt and Sons employees. The agreements were for past and future consulting
services. The total commitment related to these agreements included under &#147;Independent contractor
agreements&#148; in the table above was $681,000 as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and will be paid monthly
through 2009. The expense associated with these arrangements is included in selling, general and
administrative expenses for the Other Operations segment for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and
2007.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market valuations
that arise from interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and
equity price risk. BFC&#146;s primary market risk is equity price risk.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge are consolidated in the Company&#146;s financial
statements, a significant change in the market price of their stock would not directly impact the
Company&#146;s financial results, but would likely have an effect on the market price of our common
stock. The market price of BFC&#146;s common stock and the market prices of BankAtlantic Bancorp and
Woodbridge common stock are important to the valuation and financing capability of BFC. BFC also
owns 800,000 shares in Benihana Series&nbsp;B Convertible Preferred Stock for which no market is
available. The ability to realize or liquidate this investment will depend on future market and
economic conditions and the ability to register the shares of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock in the event
that BFC&#146;s investment in Benihana&#146;s Series&nbsp;B Convertible Preferred stock is converted, all of which
are subject to significant risk.
At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the closing price of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock was $2.10 per share. The market
value of the Convertible Preferred Stock if converted at December&nbsp;31, 2008 would have been
approximately $3.3&nbsp;million. During the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company performed an
impairment review of its investment in Benihana Convertible Preferred Stock to determine if an
impairment adjustment was needed. &nbsp;Based on the evaluation and the review of various qualitative
and quantitative factors the Company determined that there was an other-than-temporary decline of
approximately $3.6&nbsp;million, and accordingly, the investment was written down to its fair value of
approximately $16.4&nbsp;million (See Note 12 for further information).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of BankAtlantic&#146;s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, subjecting
BankAtlantic to significant interest rate risk because its assets and liabilities reprice at
different times, market interest rates change differently among each rate indices and certain
interest earning assets, primarily residential loans, may be prepaid before maturity as interest
rates change.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic has developed a model using standard industry software to measure its interest
rate risk. The model performs a sensitivity analysis that measures the effect on its net interest
income of changes in interest rates. The model measures the impact that parallel interest rate
shifts of 100 and 200 basis points would have on net interest income over a 12&nbsp;month period.

which $237.1&nbsp;million bear interest at variable interest rates and adjust quarterly and $57.1

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge is subject to interest rate risk on its long-term debt. At December&nbsp;31, 2008,
Woodbridge had $244.5&nbsp;million in borrowings with adjustable rates tied to the Prime Rate and/or
LIBOR rates and $102.2&nbsp;million in borrowings with fixed or initially-fixed rates. Consequently,
the impact on Woodbridge&#146;s variable rate debt from changes in interest rates may affect its
earnings and cash flows but would generally not impact the fair value of such debt except to the
extent of the change in credit spreads. With respect to fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates
generally affect the fair market value of the debt but not results of operations or cash flow.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge is subject to equity pricing risks associated with its investments in Bluegreen and
Office Depot. The value of these securities will vary based on the results of operations and
financial condition of these investments, the general liquidity of Bluegreen and Office Depot
common stock and general equity market conditions. The trading market for the shares of these
investments may not be liquid enough to permit Woodbridge to sell its common stock in these
investments without adversely impacting the market price of these shares, assuming that Woodbridge

BFC Financial Corporation

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the accompanying consolidated
statements of financial condition and the related consolidated statements of operations, of
comprehensive loss, of shareholders&#146; equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of BFC Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the
&#147;Company&#148;) at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December&nbsp;31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company&#146;s
management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item&nbsp;9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
statements and on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Bluegreen Corporation, an approximate 31
percent-owned equity investment of the Company which reflects a net investment totaling $115.1
million and $116.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008 (prior to an other-than-temporary impairment
recorded by the Company, net of amortization of basis difference, of $85.3&nbsp;million) and 2007,
respectively, and equity in the net earnings (loss)&nbsp;of approximately ($154,000) (prior to the
amortization of basis difference of $13.9&nbsp;million), $10.3&nbsp;million and $9.7&nbsp;million for the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The financial statements of Bluegreen
Corporation were audited by other auditors whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our
opinion on the financial statements expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included
for Bluegreen Corporation, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits and the report of other
auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

prospectively reported as a cost method investment. On the Petition Date, Levitt and Sons had

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Management&#146;s assessment and our audit of BFC Financial Corporation&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting also included controls over the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with the instructions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Savings and Loan
Holding Companies (OTS Form&nbsp;H-(b) 11) to comply with the reporting requirements of Section&nbsp;112 of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA). A company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC Financial Corporation (&#147;BFC&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a diversified holding company whose
major holdings include controlling interests in BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries (&#147;BankAtlantic Bancorp&#148;) and Woodbridge Holdings Corporation (formerly Levitt
Corporation) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (&#147;Woodbridge&#148;) and a noncontrolling interest in
Benihana, Inc. (&#147;Benihana&#148;), which operates Asian-themed restaurant chains in the United States. As
a result of the Company&#146;s position as the controlling shareholder of BankAtlantic Bancorp, BFC is a
&#147;unitary savings bank holding company&#148; regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (&#147;OTS&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a holding company with controlling positions in BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge, BFC is
required under generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) to consolidate the financial
results of these companies. As a consequence, the financial information of both entities is
presented on a consolidated basis in BFC&#146;s financial statements. However, except as otherwise
noted, the debts and obligations of BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge are not direct obligations
of BFC and are non-recourse to BFC. Similarly, the assets of those entities are not available to
BFC absent its pro rata share in a dividend or distribution.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge each completed a one-for-five reverse
split of its common stock. Where appropriate, amounts throughout this document have been adjusted
to reflect the reverse stock splits effected by BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge. The reverse
stock splits did not impact the Company&#146;s proportionate equity interest or voting rights in
BankAtlantic Bancorp or Woodbridge. BFC&#146;s ownership in BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge as of
December&nbsp;31, 2008 was as follows:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge historically has been engaged in real estate development activities in the
Southeastern United States. While Woodbridge&#146;s operations were primarily within the real estate
industry, Woodbridge&#146;s current business strategy includes the pursuit of investments and
acquisitions within or outside of the real estate industry, as well as the continued development of
master-planned communities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008, Woodbridge engaged in business activities through the Land Division, consisting of
the operations of Core Communities, LLC (&#147;Core Communities&#148; or &#147;Core&#148;), which develops
master-planned communities, and through the Woodbridge Other Operations segment (&#147;Woodbridge Other
Operations&#148;), which includes the other operations of Woodbridge, such as the consolidated
operations of Pizza Fusion Holdings, Inc. (&#147;Pizza Fusion&#148;), the consolidated operations of Carolina
Oak Homes, LLC (&#147;Carolina Oak&#148;), which engaged in homebuilding in South Carolina prior to the

through Cypress Creek Capital Holdings, LLC (&#147;Cypress Creek Capital&#148;) and Snapper Creek Equity

an investment in Office Depot, Inc. (&#147;Office Depot&#148;) are also included in the Woodbridge Other
Operations segment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2007, Woodbridge acquired from Levitt and Sons all of the outstanding membership
interests in Carolina Oak for the following consideration: (i)&nbsp;the assumption of the outstanding
principal balance of a loan in the amount of $34.1&nbsp;million which is collateralized by a 150 acre
parcel of land owned by Carolina Oak located in Tradition Hilton Head, (ii)&nbsp;the execution of a
promissory note in the amount of $400,000 to serve as a deposit under a purchase agreement between
Carolina Oak and Core Communities of South Carolina, LLC and (iii)&nbsp;the assumption of specified
payables in the amount of approximately $5.3&nbsp;million. The principal asset of Carolina Oak is a 150
acre parcel of land located in Tradition Hilton Head.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to November&nbsp;9, 2007, Woodbridge also conducted homebuilding operations through Levitt
and Sons, LLC (&#147;Levitt and Sons&#148;), which comprised Woodbridge&#146;s Homebuilding Division. The
Homebuilding Division consisted of two reportable operating segments, the Primary Homebuilding
segment and the Tennessee Homebuilding segment. Acquired in December&nbsp;1999, Levitt and Sons was a
developer of single family homes and townhome communities for active adults and families in
Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina. On November&nbsp;9, 2007 (the &#147;Petition Date&#148;), Levitt
and Sons and substantially all of its subsidiaries (collectively, the &#147;Debtors&#148;) filed voluntary
petitions for relief under Chapter&nbsp;11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the &#147;Chapter&nbsp;11
Cases&#148;) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida ( the&#148;
Bankruptcy Court&#148;). In connection with the filing of the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases, Woodbridge
deconsolidated Levitt and Sons as of November&nbsp;9, 2007, eliminating all future operations of Levitt
and Sons from Woodbridge&#146;s financial results of operations. Since Levitt and Sons&#146; results are no
longer consolidated and Woodbridge believes that it is not probable that it will be obligated to
fund future operating losses at Levitt and Sons, any adjustments reflected in Levitt and Sons&#146;
financial statements subsequent to November&nbsp;9, 2007 are not expected to affect the results of
operations of Woodbridge.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise noted, the debts and obligations of BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge
are not direct obligations of BFC and are non-recourse to BFC. Similarly, the assets of those
entities are not available to BFC absent its pro rata share in a dividend or distribution. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BFC has incurred operating cash
flow deficits which have been financed with available working capital. BFC expects to meet its
short-term liquidity requirements generally through existing cash balances and cash dividends from
Benihana. The Company anticipates that it will meet its long-term liquidity needs through
long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, future issuances of equity and/or debt securities,
and, if necessary, the sale of assets. However, current economic and financial market conditions
and the Company&#146;s recent delisting from the NYSE could make it more difficult for BFC to obtain
financing or raise capital.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s liquidity depends on its ability to maintain or increase deposit levels and
availability under its lines of credit, federal funds, Treasury and Federal Reserve programs.
Additionally, interest rate changes or disruptions in the capital markets may make terms of the
borrowings and deposits less favorable. As a result, there is a risk that BankAtlantic&#146;s cost of
fundings will increase. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic had available unused borrowings of
approximately $1.0&nbsp;billion in connection with its FHLB line of credit, federal funds lines, and
Treasury and Federal Reserve programs. However, such available borrowings are subject to periodic
reviews and may be terminated or limited at any time.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic was considered a &#147;well capitalized&#148; institution with
actual capital amounts and ratios exceeding all &#147;well capitalized&#148; amounts and ratios. However,
the OTS, at its discretion can at any time require an institution to maintain capital amounts and
ratios above the established &#147;well capitalized&#148; requirements based on its view of the risk profile
of the specific institution. If higher capital requirements are imposed, BankAtlantic could be
required to raise additional capital. There is no assurance that BankAtlantic will continue to be
deemed &#147;well capitalized&#148;, that additional capital will not be necessary, or that BankAtlantic
would be successful in raising additional capital in subsequent periods. An inability to raise
capital or to maintain &#147;well capitalized&#148; status could have a material adverse impact on
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s and BFC&#146;s financial condition and results.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008, Woodbridge, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Woodbridge Equity Fund II LP, made a
$3&nbsp;million investment in Pizza Fusion. Pizza Fusion was determined to be a VIE under the provisions
of FIN No.&nbsp;46(R) and Woodbridge Equity Fund II, LP was determined to be the primary beneficiary,
therefore, Woodbridge consolidated Pizza Fusion into its consolidated financial statements as of
September&nbsp;18, 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ordinary course of its business, Woodbridge has entered into contracts to purchase land
held for development, including option contracts. Option contracts allow Woodbridge to control
significant positions with minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated
with land ownership and development. The liability for nonperformance under such contracts is
typically only the required non-refundable deposits, but Woodbridge does not have legal title to
these assets. However, if certain conditions are met, under the requirements of FIN No.&nbsp;46(R),
Woodbridge&#146;s non-refundable deposits in these land contracts may create a variable interest, with
Woodbridge being identified as the primary beneficiary. If these conditions are met, FIN No.&nbsp;46(R)
requires Woodbridge to consolidate VIEs holding the asset to be acquired&nbsp;at its fair value.&nbsp; At

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2007, Core Communities began soliciting bids from several potential buyers to purchase
assets associated with two of Core&#146;s commercial leasing projects (the &#147;Projects&#148;). As the criteria
for assets held for sale had been met&nbsp;in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;144 <I>&#147;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS
No.&nbsp;144&#148;), the assets were reclassified to assets held for sale and the liabilities related to
those assets were reclassified to liabilities related to assets held for sale in prior periods. The
results of operations for these assets were reclassified as discontinued operations in the third
quarter of 2007 and Woodbridge ceased recording depreciation expense on these Projects. During the
fourth quarter of 2008, Woodbridge determined that given the difficulty in predicting the timing or
probability of a sale of the assets associated with the Projects as a result of, among other
things, the economic downturn and disruptions in credit markets, the requirements of SFAS No.&nbsp;144
necessary to classify these assets as held for sale and to be included in discontinued operations
were no longer met and Woodbridge could not assert the Projects can be sold within a year.&nbsp;
Therefore, the results of operations for these Projects were reclassified for the three years
ending December&nbsp;31, 2008 back into continuing operations in the consolidated statements of
operations.&nbsp;In accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144, Woodbridge recorded a depreciation recapture of $3.2
million at December&nbsp;31, 2008 to account for the depreciation not recorded while the assets were
classified as discontinued operations.&nbsp; Woodbridge compared the net carrying amount of the asset,
after taking into account the adjustment for depreciation recapture, to the fair value at the date
of the subsequent decision not to sell and determined that the adjusted net carrying value was less
than the fair value on the date of the reclassification. Total assets and liabilities related to
the Projects were $92.8&nbsp;million and $76.1&nbsp;million, respectively, for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2008 and $96.3million and $80.1&nbsp;million, respectively, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. In
addition, total revenues related to the Projects for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and
2006 were $8.7&nbsp;million, $4.7&nbsp;million and $1.8&nbsp;million, respectively, while income (loss), net of
noncontrolling interest, related to the Projects for the same period in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was

loan is not collectible. Recoveries are credited to the allowance.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance consists of two components. The first component of the allowance is for
&#147;non-homogenous&#148; loans that are individually evaluated for impairment. The process for identifying
loans to be evaluated individually for impairment is based on management&#146;s identification of
classified loans. Once an individual loan is found to be impaired, an evaluation is performed to
determine if a specific reserve needs to be assigned to the loan based on one of the following
three methods: (1)&nbsp;present value of expected future cash flows, (2)&nbsp;fair value of collateral less
costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent, or (3)&nbsp;observable market price.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second component of the allowance is for &#147;homogenous loans&#148; in which groups of loans with
common characteristics are evaluated to estimate the inherent losses in the portfolio. Management
of BankAtlantic segregates homogenous loans into groups with certain common characteristics so as
to form a basis for estimating losses as it relates to the group. The allowance for homogenous
loans has a quantitative amount and a qualitative amount. The methodology for the quantitative

the loan becoming past due 90&nbsp;days as to either principal or interest or (ii)&nbsp;when the borrower has
entered bankruptcy proceedings and the loan is delinquent. Exceptions to placing 90-day past due
loans on non-accrual may be made if there exists well secured collateral and the loan is in the
process of collection. Loans are placed on non-accrual or charged-off at an earlier date if
collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. A loan may be placed on non-accrual
status due to material deterioration of conditions surrounding the repayment sources, which could
include insufficient borrower capacity to service the debt, delayed property sales or development
schedules, declining loan-to-value of the loan&#146;s collateral or other factors causing the full
payment of the loan&#146;s principal and interest to be in doubt. Accordingly, the Company may place a
loan on non-accrual status even where payments of principal or interest are not currently in
default. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, interest accrued but not received is reversed
against interest income. A non-accrual loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent loan
payments are collected and the loan is expected to perform in the future according to its
contractual terms. Interest income on performing impaired loans is recognized on an accrual basis
and the cost-recovery method is used for cash receipts on non-accrual loans without specific

assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used
is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its
estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount by which
the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.

duration and extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than cost, and the Company&#146;s
intent and ability to hold the investment until it recovers. The Company also considers specific
adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee,
including industry and sector performance, rating agency actions, changes in operational and

is capitalized to real estate inventory or property and equipment during the active development
period. For inventory, interest is capitalized at the effective rates paid on borrowings during the
pre-construction and planning stages and the periods that projects are under development.
Capitalization of interest is discontinued if development ceases at a project. Capitalized interest
is expensed as a component of cost of sales as related homes, land and units are sold. For
property and equipment under construction, interest associated with these assets is capitalized as
incurred to property and equipment and is expensed through depreciation once the asset is put into
use.

leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, equipment and computer software and water treatment
and irrigation facilities, and are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Land is carried
at cost. Depreciation is primarily computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which generally range up to 50&nbsp;years for water and irrigation facilities, 40
years for buildings and 3 to 10&nbsp;years for equipment. The cost of leasehold improvements is
amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the terms of the related leases or the
useful lives of the assets. Interest expense associated with the construction of certain fixed
assets is capitalized as incurred and relieved to expense through depreciation once the asset is
put into use. Direct costs associated with development of internal-use software are capitalized and
amortized over 3 to 5&nbsp;years. In cases where the Company determines that land and the related
development costs are to be used as fixed assets, these costs are transferred from inventory of
real estate to property and equipment. For fixed assets that are under construction, interest
associated with these assets is capitalized as incurred and will be relieved to expense through
depreciation once the asset is put into use.

in Pizza Fusion. Intangible assets consisted of franchise contracts which were valued using a
discounted cash flows methodology and are amortized over the average life of the franchise
contracts. The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require Woodbridge to make
significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to outside factors. In accordance
with SFAS No.&nbsp;144, Woodbridge evaluates when events and circumstances indicate that assets may be
impaired and when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less
than their carrying amounts. The carrying value of these assets is dependent upon estimates of
future earnings that Woodbridge expects to generate. If cash flows decrease significantly,
intangible assets may be impaired and would be written down to their fair value.

possession of the property and the risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the buyer, and when
there is no substantial continuing involvement in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;66, <I>&#147;Accounting for
Sales of Real Estate&#148; (&#147;</I>SFAS No.&nbsp;66&#148;). In order to properly match revenues with expenses,
Woodbridge estimates construction and land development costs incurred and to be incurred, but not
paid at the time of closing. Estimated costs to complete are determined for each closed home and
land sale based upon historical data with respect to similar product types and geographical areas
and allocated to closings along with actual costs incurred based on a relative sales value
approach. To the extent the estimated costs to complete have significantly changed, Woodbridge will
adjust cost of sales in the current period for the impact on cost of sales of previously sold homes

land sale takes place prior to all contracted work being completed. Pursuant to the requirements
of SFAS No.&nbsp;66, if the seller has some continuing involvement with the property and does not
transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership, profit shall be recognized by a
method determined by the nature and extent of the seller&#146;s continuing involvement. In the case of
land sales, this involvement typically consists of final development activities. Woodbridge
recognizes revenue and related costs as work progresses using the percentage of completion method,
which relies on estimates of total expected costs to complete required work. Revenue is recognized
in proportion to the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs at the
time of sale. Actual revenues and costs to complete construction in the future could differ from
current estimates. If the estimates of development costs remaining to be completed and relative
sales values are significantly different from actual amounts, then the revenues, related cumulative
profits and costs of sales may be revised in the period that estimates change.

revenue from long-term leases of commercial property. The Company reviews all new leases in

statement purposes after adjustment for transactions that do not have tax consequences. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are realized according to the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates
as of the date of the statement of financial condition. The effect of a change in tax rates on
deferred tax assets and liabilities is reflected in the period that includes the statutory
enactment date. A deferred tax asset valuation allowance is recorded when it has been determined
that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. If a valuation
allowance is needed a subsequent change in circumstances in future periods that causes a change in
judgment about the realization of the related deferred tax amount could result in the reversal of
the deferred tax valuation allowance.

Interpretation No.&nbsp;48 <I>&#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB No 109&#148;</I>
(&#147;FIN 48&#148;). An uncertain tax position is defined by FIN 48 as a position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return that is not based on clear and unambiguous tax law and which is reflected in
measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. The
Company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely
than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on
the technical merits of the position. The Company measures the tax benefits recognized based on the
largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its provision
for income taxes.

(revised 2004), <I>&#147;Share-Based Payment&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;123R&#148;), using the modified prospective transition
method. Under this transition method, share-based compensation expense for each of the three year
period ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, includes compensation expense for all share-based compensation
awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, January&nbsp;1, 2006, based on the grant date fair

Stock-Based Compensation&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;123&#148;). Share-based compensation expense for all stock-based
compensation awards granted after January&nbsp;1, 2006 is based on the grant-date fair value estimated
in accordance with the provisions of SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;123R. The Company recognizes these compensation costs
on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the
option vesting term of five years, except for options granted to directors which vest immediately.
SFAS No.&nbsp;123R requires public entities to initially measure compensation cost associated with
awards of liability instruments based on their current fair value. The fair value of that award is
to be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date. Changes in fair
value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2007, FASB Statement No.&nbsp;141 (Revised 2007), <I>&#147;Business Combinations&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS No.
141(R)&#148;) was issued. This statement significantly changed the accounting for business combinations.
Under SFAS No.&nbsp;141(R), an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited
exceptions. SFAS No.141(R) changed the accounting treatment for certain specific items, including
the following: acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred; noncontrolling interests
(formerly known as &#147;minority interests&#148;) is valued at fair value at the acquisition date; acquired
contingent liabilities are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured
at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for
non-acquired contingencies; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax
uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense. Also included in
SFAS No.141(R) are a substantial number of new disclosure requirements. SFAS No.141(R) applies
prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning
of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December&nbsp;15, 2008. Earlier adoption was
prohibited. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2009, the Company adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;141(R) and its guidance will be
applied prospectively to business combinations. SFAS No.&nbsp;141 (R)&nbsp;could have a material effect on
the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements to the extent the Company consummates business
combinations due to the requirement that all transaction costs are expensed as incurred. &nbsp;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2007, FASB issued FASB Statement No.&nbsp;160, <I>&#147;Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements&#151;An Amendment of ARB No.&nbsp;51&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;160&#148;). SFAS No.&nbsp;160
established new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary
and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition
of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements
and separate from the parent&#146;s equity. SFAS No.&nbsp;160 also established accounting and reporting
standards for the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the
noncontrolling interest. SFAS No.&nbsp;160 clarifies that changes in a parent&#146;s ownership interest in a
subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its
controlling financial interest. In addition, SFAS No.&nbsp;160 requires that a parent recognize a gain
or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated.

years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December&nbsp;15, 2008.
Earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;160 on January&nbsp;1, 2009, and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No.&nbsp;161, &#147;<I>Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;161&#148;). SFAS No.&nbsp;161 is intended to improve financial
reporting by requiring transparency about the location and amounts of derivative instruments in an
entity&#146;s financial statements; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted
for under SFAS No 133; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity&#146;s
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No.&nbsp;161 is effective for the first
quarter of 2009. SFAS No.&nbsp;161 expands derivative disclosure on the annual and interim reporting

the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to
determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No.&nbsp;142. FSP FAS No.&nbsp;142-3
intends to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under
SFAS No.&nbsp;142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset
under SFAS No.&nbsp;141R. FSP FAS No.&nbsp;142-3 is effective for the Company&#146;s fiscal year beginning January
1, 2009 and must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From August&nbsp;18, 2008 through August&nbsp;28, 2008, BFC purchased an aggregate of 400,000 shares of
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock on the open market for an aggregate purchase price of
$2.8&nbsp;million. BFC&#146;s acquisition of the 400,000 <B>s</B>hares of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common
stock increased BFC&#146;s ownership interest in BankAtlantic Bancorp by approximately 3.6%. The excess
of the fair value over the purchase price (negative goodwill) of $16.7&nbsp;million was allocated as a
pro rata reduction of the amounts that would otherwise have been assigned ratably to all of the
non-current and non-financial acquired assets, except assets to be disposed of by sale and deferred
tax assets, until the basis of such acquired assets was zero. The remaining unallocated negative
goodwill of approximately $9.1&nbsp;million was recognized as an extraordinary gain for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008.

each share of such stock owned on that date (the &#147;Rights Offering&#148;). Each whole subscription right
entitled the holder thereof to purchase one share of Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock at a

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;28, 2007, BankAtlantic Bancorp sold Ryan Beck to Stifel. Under the terms of the
sales agreement, BankAtlantic Bancorp and employees of Ryan Beck who held options to acquire Ryan
Beck common stock exchanged their entire interest in Ryan Beck common stock and options to acquire
Ryan Beck common stock for an aggregate of 3,701,400 shares of Stifel common stock, cash of $2.7
million and five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 750,000 shares of Stifel common stock at
an exercise price of $24.00 per share. Of the total Ryan Beck sales proceeds, BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s portion was 3,566,031 shares of Stifel common stock, cash of $2.6&nbsp;million and warrants to
acquire an aggregate of 722,586 shares of Stifel common stock. BankAtlantic Bancorp sold its entire
investment in 3,566,031 shares of Stifel common stock and warrants to acquire 722,586 shares of
Stifel common stock during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and recognized a gain of $2.8&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, BankAtlantic Bancorp owned approximately 17% of the issued and
outstanding shares of Stifel common stock and did not have the ability to exercise significant
influence over Stifel&#146;s operations. As such, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s investment in Stifel common
stock was accounted for under the cost method of accounting. Stifel common stock that could be sold
within one year was accounted for as securities available for sale and Stifel common stock which
was subject to restrictions on sale for more than one year was accounted for as investment
securities at cost. The warrants were accounted for as derivatives with unrealized gains and
losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the warrants recorded in securities activities,
net. Included in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as of December&nbsp;31,
2007 under &#147;securities available for sale&#148; and &#147;investment securities at cost&#148; were $72.6&nbsp;million
and $31.4&nbsp;million, respectively, of Stifel common stock, and included in financial instruments at
fair value was $10.6&nbsp;million of warrants.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stifel sales agreement provided for contingent earn-out payments, payable in cash or
shares of Stifel common stock, at Stifel&#146;s election, based on (a)&nbsp;defined Ryan Beck private client
revenues during the two-year period immediately following the Ryan Beck sale up to a maximum of $40
million and (b)&nbsp;defined Ryan Beck investment banking revenues equal to 25% of the amount that such
revenues exceed $25.0&nbsp;million during each of the two twelve-month periods immediately following the
Ryan Beck sale.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s discontinued operations
included $16.6&nbsp;million of earn-out consideration. Associated with this amount, BFC&#146;s discontinued
operations, net of noncontrolling interest, was approximately $4.5&nbsp;million which is included in the
Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operation in discontinued operations during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008. Ryan Beck&#146;s investment banking revenues exceeded $25&nbsp;million during the first
twelve months subsequent to the sale and BankAtlantic Bancorp received additional consideration of
55,016 shares of Stifel common stock valued at $1.7&nbsp;million. BankAtlantic Bancorp recognized
additional earn-out consideration of $14.9&nbsp;million as private client revenues exceeded the defined
amounts as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. The additional consideration associated with the private client
revenues was pursuant to the parties&#146; agreement to be payable by April&nbsp;15, 2009 in cash or Stifel
stock. However, during 2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp and Stifel entered into an amendment to the
merger agreement whereby Stifel agreed to prepay $10&nbsp;million of the Ryan Beck private client group
earn-out payment for a discounted payment of $9.6&nbsp;million. BankAtlantic Bancorp received 233,500
shares of Stifel common stock in consideration for the $9.6&nbsp;million advance earn-out payment. The
remaining potential contingent earn-out payments, if any, will be accounted for when earned as
additional proceeds from the sale of Ryan Beck and included in the Company&#146;s Consolidated
Statements of Operations as discontinued operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp sold the 288,516 shares of Stifel common stock received in connection
with the investment banking earn-out agreement and the private client earn-out advance payment
during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. Included in other assets in the Company&#146;s statement of
financial condition as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 was a $5.1&nbsp;million receivable from Stifel associated
with the private client revenue earn-out agreement.

information is available that is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in
assessing performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Reportable segments consist of one or
more operating segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, production
processes, type of customer, distribution system or regulatory environment.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information provided for segment reporting is based on internal reports utilized by
management of the Company and its respective subsidiaries. The presentation and allocation of
assets and results of operations may not reflect the actual economic costs of the segments as stand
alone businesses. If a different basis of allocation were utilized, the relative contributions of
the segments might differ but the relative trends in segments&#146; operating results would, in
management&#146;s view, likely not be impacted.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company currently operates through five reportable segments, which are: BFC Activities,
BankAtlantic, BankAtlantic Bancorp Other Operations, Land Division and Woodbridge Other Operations.
In 2007, the Company operated through two additional reportable segments, Primary Homebuilding and
Tennessee Homebuilding, both of which were eliminated as a result of Levitt and Sons&#146;
deconsolidation as of November&nbsp;9, 2007. The Company&#146;s financial services activities include
BankAtlantic Bancorp results of operations and consist of two reportable segments, which are:
BankAtlantic and BankAtlantic Bancorp Other Operations. The Company&#146;s real estate development
activities include Woodbridge&#146;s results of operations and consist of two reportable segments, which
are: Land Division and Woodbridge Other Operations. Prior to 2008, the BankAtlantic and
BankAtlantic Other Operations segments were combined and reported under the single segment
&#147;Financial Services&#148;, but as of January&nbsp;1, 2008, the Company implemented a new internal reporting
methodology for evaluating its financial services activities and as a result the Company&#146;s former
Financial Services segment is now comprised of two reportable segments instead of one as previously
reported.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No.&nbsp;108 (&#147;SAB No.&nbsp;108&#148;) which established an approach to quantify errors in financial
statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAB No.&nbsp;108 permitted companies to initially apply its provisions by either restating prior
period financial statements or recording the cumulative effect of adjusting assets and liabilities
as of January&nbsp;1, 2006 as an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The
Company applied the provisions of SAB No.&nbsp;108 using the cumulative effect transition method in
connection with the preparation of its financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006.
The impact of quantifying the effects of prior period financial statement misstatements using the
dual-approach compared to the roll-over method on opening statement of financial condition balances
was attributable to BankAtlantic&#146;s adjustments and such impact to the Company&#146;s financial condition
balances is summarized as follows: (in thousands)

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2007, BankAtlantic decided to sell certain properties that it had acquired for its
future store expansion program and terminate or sublease certain back-office operating leases. As a
consequence, BankAtlantic recorded a $1.5&nbsp;million impairment charge for back-office facilities and
for land acquired for store expansion, incurred a $3.3&nbsp;million impairment charge for engineering
and architectural fees associated with obtaining permits for store sites and recorded lease
termination liabilities of $1.0&nbsp;million associated with executed lease contracts. Sales prices or
annual rental rates for similar properties were used to determine fair value.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2007, BankAtlantic Bancorp reduced its workforce by approximately 225 associates, or
8%. Included in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2007 were $2.6&nbsp;million of costs associated with one-time termination benefits. These benefits
include $0.3&nbsp;million of share-based compensation.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic incurred an additional $3.2&nbsp;million of
impairment charges in connection with the decision to dispose of land acquired for store expansion.
BankAtlantic also incurred $1.5&nbsp;million of asset impairment charges associated with the
consolidation of back-office facilities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp further reduced its workforce by
approximately 6% primarily in the community banking and commercial lending business units and
incurred $2.2&nbsp;million of employee termination costs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to consolidate its back-office facilities and terminate or sublease certain operating
leases executed for store expansion during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic incurred
$2.4&nbsp;million of exit activity charges associated with writing down lease contracts to fair values
or incurring costs to terminate lease contracts. By terminating certain operating leases
BankAtlantic realized a $2.2&nbsp;million benefit from the reversal of rent expense recognized in prior
periods upon taking possession of the properties before the commencement of rent payments.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2008, BankAtlantic sold five stores in Central Florida to an unrelated financial
institution. The following table summarizes the assets sold, liabilities transferred and cash

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third and fourth quarters of 2007, substantially all of Levitt and Sons&#146; employees were
terminated and 22 employees were terminated at Woodbridge primarily as a result of the Chapter&nbsp;11
Cases. On November&nbsp;9, 2007, Woodbridge implemented an employee fund and indicated that it would
pay up to $5&nbsp;million of severance benefits to terminated Levitt and Sons employees to supplement
the limited termination benefits which Levitt and Sons was permitted to pay to those employees.
Levitt and Sons is restricted in the amount of termination benefits it can pay to its former
employees by virtue of the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The severance related and benefits accrual includes severance and severance related payments
made to Levitt and Sons employees, payroll taxes and other benefits related to the terminations
that occurred in 2007 as part of the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and
2007, Woodbridge paid approximately $4.1&nbsp;million and $600,000, respectively, in severance and
termination charges related to the employee fund as well as severance for employees other than
Levitt and Sons employees which is reflected in the Other Operations segment and paid $2.3&nbsp;million
in severance to the employees of the Homebuilding Division prior to deconsolidation in 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Employees entitled to participate in the fund either received payments over time, which in certain
cases extended over two years, or a lump sum payment, dependent on a variety of factors. For any
amounts paid related to the fund from the Woodbridge Other Operations segment, these payments were
in exchange for an assignment to Woodbridge by those employees of their unsecured claims against
Levitt and Sons. At December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007 there was $129,000 and $2&nbsp;million, respectively,
accrued to be paid related to this fund as well as severance for employees other than Levitt and
Sons employees. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, Woodbridge did not expect to incur additional severance
related expenses with respect to the Levitt and Sons employees.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facilities accrual represents expense associated with property and equipment leases that
Woodbridge had entered into that are no longer providing a benefit to Woodbridge, as well as
termination fees related to contractual obligations Woodbridge cancelled. Included in this amount
are future minimum lease payments, fees and expenses, net of estimated sublease income for which
the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;146 <I>&#147;Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities&#148;</I>,
as applicable, were satisfied. This restructuring expense is included in selling general and
administrative expenses for the Woodbridge Other Operations segment for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The independent contractor related expense relates to two agreements entered into with former
Levitt and Sons employees. The agreements are for past and future consulting services. The total
commitment related to these agreements is $681,000 as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and will be paid monthly
through 2009. The expense associated with these arrangements is included in selling general and
administrative expenses for the Woodbridge Other Operations segment for the years ended December
31, 2008 and 2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levitt and Sons had $33.3&nbsp;million in surety bonds related to its ongoing projects at the time
of the filing of the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases.&nbsp; In the event that these obligations are drawn and paid by
the surety, Woodbridge could be responsible for up to&nbsp;$11.7&nbsp;million plus costs and expenses in
accordance with the surety indemnity agreements. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, Woodbridge had a $1.1
million surety bonds accrual at Woodbridge related to certain bonds for which its management
considers it to be probable that Woodbridge will be required to reimburse the surety under
applicable indemnity agreements.&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, Woodbridge reimbursed the
surety $532,000 in accordance with the indemnity agreement for bond claims paid during the period.
It is unclear whether and to what extent the remaining outstanding surety bonds of Levitt and Sons
will be drawn and the extent to which Woodbridge may be responsible for additional amounts beyond
this accrual.&nbsp; Woodbridge will not have the ability to receive any repayment, assets or other
consideration as recovery from Levitt and Sons of any amounts it is required to pay. &nbsp;The expense
associated with this accrual is included in other expense in the Woodbridge Other Operations
segment for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, due to its non-recurring and unusual nature.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company tests goodwill for potential impairment annually or during interim periods if
impairment indicators exist. Based on the results of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s impairment evaluation,
an impairment charge was recorded of approximately $46.6&nbsp;million, net of purchase accounting
adjustment. The entire amounts of $31&nbsp;million and $17.3&nbsp;million, respectively, relating to
BankAtlantic&#146;s commercial lending and community banking reporting units were determined to be
impaired. Goodwill associated with BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s capital services, tax certificates and
investment reporting units of $13.1&nbsp;million, $4.7&nbsp;million and $4.4&nbsp;million, respectively, was
determined to not be impaired.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goodwill impairment recognized during 2008 generally reflects the ongoing crisis in the
financial services industry, the decline of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s market capitalization
significantly below its tangible book value and the effect that the continued deterioration in the
general economy as well as the Florida real estate markets has had on the credit quality of
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s and BankAtlantic&#146;s loan portfolios. The above trends primarily resulted in
a decline in the fair value of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s reporting units resulting in the
aforementioned goodwill impairment.
</DIV>


&nbsp;



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value
of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s reporting units. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain
judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows, including BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations, and assumptions about
BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s strategic plans with regard to its operations. Due to the uncertainties
associated with such estimates, actual results could differ from such estimates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing its impairment analysis, BankAtlantic Bancorp used a combination of the
discounted cash flow methodology and a market multiple methodology to determine the fair value of
each reporting unit. The aggregate fair value of all reporting units was compared to BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s market capitalization adjusted for a control premium in order to determine the
reasonableness of the financial model output. A control premium represents the value an investor
would pay above minority interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in
the respective company.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of
the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit. The discount rate applied
to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks
of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows.
BankAtlantic Bancorp generally uses a five year period in computing discounted cash flow values.
The most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount
rate, the terminal value and the forecast of future cash flows.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market multiple methodology establishes fair value by comparing BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
reporting units to other similar publicly traded companies. The market multiples that BankAtlantic
Bancorp used in the determination of the fair value of the reporting units were its market
capitalization to its tangible stockholders&#146; equity and its market capitalization to its
stockholders&#146; equity.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, Woodbridge conducted an impairment review of the goodwill
related to the Tennessee Homebuilding segment in the Homebuilding Division acquired in connection
with its acquisition of Bowden Building Corporation in 2004. Woodbridge used a discounted cash
flow methodology to determine the amount of impairment resulting in completely writing off goodwill
of approximately $1.3&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. The write-off is included in
Real Estate Development other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

realized a gain of approximately $1.2&nbsp;million as a result of the sale which is included in Real
Estate Development securities activities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During December&nbsp;2008, Woodbridge performed an impairment analysis of its remaining investment
in Office Depot common stock. Woodbridge concluded that there was an other-than-temporary
impairment associated with its investment in Office Depot based on the severity of the decline of
the fair value of its investment, the length of time the stock price had been below the carrying
value of Woodbridge&#146;s investment, the continued decline in the overall economy and credit markets,
and the unpredictability of the recovery of the Office Depot stock price. &nbsp; Accordingly, Woodbridge
recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of approximately $12&nbsp;million representing the
difference of the average cost of $11.33 per share and the fair value of $2.98 per share as of
December&nbsp;31, 2008 multiplied by the number of shares of Office Depot common stock owned by
Woodbridge at that date. As a result of the impairment charge, Woodbridge&#146;s investment in Office
Depot was $4.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008. On March&nbsp;13, 2009, the closing price of Office
Depot&#146;s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $1.10 per share. &nbsp;

Level 1 valuation inputs under SFAS No.&nbsp;157. Woodbridge uses quoted market prices to value equity
securities. The fair value of the Office Depot common stock at December&nbsp;31, 2008 was calculated

on December&nbsp;31, 2008. On March&nbsp;13, 2009, the closing price of Office Depot common stock was $1.10
per share. Woodbridge will continue to monitor this investment in accordance with FSP FAS
115-1/124-1 to determine whether any further other-than-temporary impairment associated with this
investment may be required in future periods.

initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;) of its common stock. Pursuant to the IPO, member financial
institutions received cash and Class&nbsp;B common stock for their interest in MasterCard. BankAtlantic
received $0.5&nbsp;million in cash and 25,587 shares of MasterCard&#146;s Class&nbsp;B common stock. The $0.5
million cash proceeds were reflected in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations in
Financial Services &#151; Securities activities, net. The Class&nbsp;B common stock received was accounted
for as a nonmonetary transaction and recorded at historical cost. During the years ended December
31, 2008 and 2007, BankAtlantic sold 3,313 shares and 22,000 shares of MasterCard common stock for
gains of $1.0&nbsp;million and $3.4&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2007, BankAtlantic&#146;s Investment Committee approved a plan to restructure its
investment portfolio with a view towards improving the net interest margin and shortening the
duration of the portfolio. The tax-exempt municipal securities in the investment securities
portfolio had long durations, and the tax-free returns on these securities were not beneficial to
BankAtlantic in light of losses which were incurred during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30,
2007. As a consequence, BankAtlantic&#146;s management decided to sell the held-to-maturity municipal
securities and transferred its entire held-to-maturity municipal securities portfolio of $203
million to securities available for sale in October&nbsp;2007. BankAtlantic&#146;s management does not plan
to designate securities as held-to-maturity for the foreseeable future and believes that
maintaining its securities in the available for sale category provides greater flexibility in the
management of the overall investment portfolio.

the Convertible Preferred Stock, if converted, would represent an approximately 19% voting interest
and an approximately 9.4% economic interest in Benihana. Historically, the Company&#146;s investment in Benihana&#146;s
Convertible Preferred Stock has been classified as investment securities and has been  carried at historical
cost.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Convertible Preferred Stock was acquired pursuant to an agreement with Benihana on June&nbsp;8, 2004
to purchase an aggregate of 800,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock for $25.00 per share. The
shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock have voting rights on an &#147;as if converted&#148; basis together
with Benihana&#146;s Common Stock on all matters put to a vote of the holders of Benihana&#146;s Common
Stock. The approval of a majority of the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock then
outstanding, voting as a single class, are required for certain events outside the ordinary course
of business. Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative
quarterly dividends at an annual rate equal to $1.25 per share, payable on the last day of each
calendar quarter. The Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to mandatory redemption at the
original issue price plus accumulated dividends on July&nbsp;2, 2014 unless BFC elects to extend the
mandatory redemption date to a later date not to extend beyond July&nbsp;2, 2024. In addition, the
Convertible Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the original issue price of $20.0&nbsp;million plus
accumulated dividends by Benihana for a limited period beginning three years from the date of issue
if the price of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock is at least $25.33 for sixty consecutive trading days. At
December&nbsp;31, 2008, the closing price of Benihana&#146;s Common Stock was $2.10 per share. The market
value of the Convertible Preferred Stock if converted at December&nbsp;31, 2008 would have been
approximately $3.3&nbsp;million. During the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company performed an
impairment review of its investment in Benihana Convertible Preferred Stock to determine if an
impairment adjustment was needed. Based on the evaluation and the review of various qualitative and quantitative factors, including the decline in the underlying trading value of Benihana&#146;s common stock and the redemption provisions of the
Company&#146;s Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company determined that there was an other-than-temporary decline of

approximately $3.6 million, and accordingly, the investment was written down to its fair value of
approximately $16.4 million. Concurrent with management&#146;s evaluation of the impairment of this investment at December 31, 2008, it made the determination to reclassify this investment
from investment securities which are carried at cost to investment securities available for
sale in accordance with SFAS No. 115, &#147;Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performing impaired loans are impaired loans which are still accruing interest. Loans 90&nbsp;days
past due and still accruing are primarily loans that matured and the borrower continues to make
payments under the matured loan agreement. Troubled debt restructured loans are loans in which the
original terms were modified granting the borrower loan concessions due to financial difficulties.
BankAtlantic had commitments to lend $15.6&nbsp;million of additional funds on non-performing and
potential problem loans as of December&nbsp;31, 2008.

million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is included in

respectively, of software cost amortization. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s unamortized software costs
were $4.8&nbsp;million and $6.4&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007. Woodbridge&#146;s depreciation

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006, BankAtlantic exchanged branch facilities
properties with unrelated third parties. The transactions were real estate for real estate
exchanges with no cash payments received. The transactions were accounted for at the fair value of
the branch facilities transferred and BankAtlantic recognized a $0.5&nbsp;million and $1.8&nbsp;million gain
in connection with the exchanges for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge received proceeds from the sale of property and equipment for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2006 of approximately $5.6&nbsp;million and $1.9&nbsp;million, respectively. As a
result of these sales, Woodbridge realized a gain on sale of property and equipment for the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2006 of approximately $2.5&nbsp;million and $1.9&nbsp;million, respectively.
Sales of property and equipment for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 were not material.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2007, Woodbridge performed a review of its fixed assets and determined that certain
leasehold improvements were no longer appropriately valued upon vacating the leased space
associated with those improvements. Therefore, the leasehold improvements in the amount of
$564,000 related to this vacated space were written off in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, BankAtlantic Bancorp recorded real estate
inventory impairments of $1.2&nbsp;million and a $5.2&nbsp;million, respectively, associated with declining
fair values of residential real estate. Land held for sale is land BankAtlantic acquired for its
store expansion program. In December&nbsp;2007, BankAtlantic decided to sell this land and transferred
the properties from properties held for use to land and facilities held for sale. BankAtlantic
evaluates these properties based on updated indicators of value periodically and recognized $2.8

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the various impairment analyses conducted throughout 2008, 2007 and 2006,
Woodbridge recorded impairment charges of approximately $3.5&nbsp;million, $226.9&nbsp;million and $36.8
million, respectively, in cost of sales of real estate in the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007
and 2006. &nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2008, Woodbridge made the decision to suspend the
development activities of Carolina Oak and is re-evaluating its alternatives with respect to this
entity due to the continued deterioration of the real estate markets. &nbsp;As a result, Woodbridge
re-evaluated its impairment analyses in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144 and determined that an
impairment charge of $3.5&nbsp;million was required to write the inventory down to its fair value at
December&nbsp;31, 2008. This impairment charge was recorded in Woodbridge&#146;s Other Operations segment.
&nbsp;The impairment charges recorded in 2007 and 2006 related to Levitt and Sons&#146; inventory of real
estate and were recorded in the Primary and Tennessee Homebuilding segments. In addition, included
in total impairment charges was approximately $2.4&nbsp;million in 2008, and $9.3&nbsp;million in 2007 of
impairment charges relating to capitalized interest in Woodbridge&#146;s Other Operations segment in
connection with Carolina Oak in 2008 and the projects that Levitt and Sons ceased developing in
2007, respectively. &nbsp;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2008, February&nbsp;2007 and January&nbsp;2006, BankAtlantic Bancorp recorded a gain of
approximately $1.0&nbsp;million, $1.3&nbsp;million and $0.6&nbsp;million, respectively, associated with the sale
of the underlying properties in joint ventures. During 2008, BankAtlantic Bancorp liquidated all
of its investments in rental real estate joint ventures.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2008, Woodbridge determined that the fair value of its investment
in unconsolidated trusts, which consists of its common interests in subordinated trust debt
securities of approximately $406,000, was less than the carrying value of this investment of $2.6
million primarily due to the deterioration of the market for these instruments and overall economic
conditions. &nbsp;The fair value was assessed using Level 3 inputs as defined by FAS No.&nbsp;157, whereby
Woodbridge&#146;s valuation technique was to measure the fair value based upon the current rates and
spreads that were used to value the underlying subordinated trust debt securities which is
primarily based upon similarly rated corporate bonds. Woodbridge evaluated its investment for
other-than-temporary impairment due to the significance of the carrying value in excess of fair
value, and the lack of evidence to support the recoverability of the carrying value in the near
future. Therefore, based upon the criteria for other-than-temporary impairment as defined in FSP
FAS 115-1/FAS 124-1, Woodbridge determined that an impairment charge of approximately $2.1&nbsp;million
was required at December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Investment in Bluegreen</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2008, Woodbridge owned approximately 9.5&nbsp;million shares of common stock of
Bluegreen, representing approximately 31% of Bluegreen&#146;s outstanding common stock. &nbsp;Woodbridge
accounts for its investment in Bluegreen under the equity method of accounting. The cost of the
Bluegreen investment is adjusted to recognize Woodbridge&#146;s interest in Bluegreen&#146;s earnings or
losses. &nbsp;The difference between a) Woodbridge&#146;s ownership percentage in Bluegreen multiplied by its
earnings and b) the amount of Woodbridge&#146;s equity in earnings of Bluegreen as reflected in
Woodbridge&#146;s financial statements relates to the amortization or accretion of purchase accounting
adjustments made at the time of the acquisition of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock, to adjustments made to
Woodbridge&#146;s investment balance related to equity transactions recorded by Bluegreen that effect
Woodbridge&#146;s ownership and to the cumulative adjustment discussed below.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective January&nbsp;1, 2006, Bluegreen adopted SOP 04-02. &nbsp; This Statement amends FAS No.&nbsp;67 to
state that the guidance for (a)&nbsp;incidental operations and (b)&nbsp;costs incurred to sell real estate
projects does not apply to real estate time-sharing transactions. The accounting for those
operations and costs is subject to the guidance in SOP 04-02. Bluegreen&#146;s adoption of SOP 04-02
resulted in a one-time, non-cash, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle charge of
$4.5&nbsp;million to Bluegreen for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, and accordingly reduced the
earnings in Bluegreen recorded by Woodbridge by approximately $1.4&nbsp;million for the same period.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, Woodbridge began evaluating its investment in Bluegreen for other-than-temporary
impairment in accordance with FSP FAS 115-1/FAS 124-1, APB No.&nbsp;18 and SAB No.&nbsp;59 as the fair value
of the Bluegreen stock had fallen below the carrying value of Woodbridge&#146;s investment in Bluegreen
of approximately $12 per share. &nbsp;Woodbridge analyzed various quantitative and qualitative factors
including Woodbridge&#146;s intent and ability to hold the investment, the severity and duration of the
impairment and the prospects for the improvement of fair value. On July&nbsp;21, 2008, Bluegreen&#146;s Board
of Directors entered into a non-binding letter of intent for the sale of Bluegreen&#146;s outstanding
common stock for $15 per share to a third party, with a due diligence and exclusivity period
through September&nbsp;15, 2008. This due diligence and exclusivity period was subsequently extended
through November&nbsp;15, 2008. &nbsp;In October&nbsp;2008, Bluegreen disclosed that the third party buyer had
been unable to obtain the financing necessary to execute a sale transaction, therefore, no
assurances could be provided that a sale would be completed. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the
exclusivity period had expired and Bluegreen was not able to consummate a sale.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At September&nbsp;30, 2008, Woodbridge&#146;s investment in Bluegreen was $114.6&nbsp;million (net of BFC&#146;s
purchase accounting of $4.7&nbsp;million) compared to the $65.8&nbsp;million trading value (calculated based
upon the $6.91 closing price of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on
September&nbsp;30, 2008). &nbsp;Woodbridge determined that its investment in Bluegreen was
other-than-temporarily impaired due to the severity of the decline in the fair value of the
investment, the probability that a sale could not be executed by Bluegreen, and due to the
deterioration of the debt and equity markets in the third quarter of 2008. &nbsp;Therefore, Woodbridge
recorded an impairment charge of $53.6&nbsp;million adjusting the carrying value of its investment in
Bluegreen to $65.8&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2008. Additionally, after further evaluation of
Woodbridge&#146;s investment in Bluegreen as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, based on, among other things, the
continued decline of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock price and the continued deterioration of the equity
markets, Woodbridge determined that an additional impairment of the investment in Bluegreen was
appropriate. Accordingly, Woodbridge recorded a $40.8&nbsp;million impairment charge (calculated based
upon the $3.13 closing price of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on December
31, 2008) and adjusted the carrying value of its investment in Bluegreen to $29.8&nbsp;million. On March
13, 2009, the closing price of Bluegreen&#146;s common stock was $1.12 per share.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the step acquisition of Woodbridge shares by BFC in 2007 and the impairment charges taken by Woodbridge in 2008, a basis difference was created between
the Company&#146;s investment in Bluegreen and the underlying assets and liabilities carried on the books
of Bluegreen of $13.9&nbsp;million. &nbsp;Therefore, earnings from Bluegreen will be adjusted each period to reflect the
amortization of this basis difference. &nbsp;As such, an allocation methodology was established by which
the basis difference was allocated to the relative fair value of Bluegreen&#146;s underlying assets
based upon the position that the basis difference was a reflection of the perceived value of these
underlying assets. &nbsp;The appropriate amortization will be calculated based on the useful lives of
the underlying assets and other relevant data associated with each asset category. As such,
amortization of $13.9&nbsp;million was recorded into the Company&#146;s pro rata share of Bluegreen&#146;s net
loss for the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2008.

carrying values aggregating $174.5&nbsp;million and $159.2&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and
2007, respectively. Core has a credit agreement with a financial institution which provides
for borrowings of up to $88.9&nbsp;million. This facility matures in June&nbsp;2011 and has a loan to
value limitation of 55%. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, $86.9&nbsp;million was outstanding with no
current availability for further borrowing based on available collateral. Core has a credit
agreement with a financial institution which provides for borrowings of up to $33.0
million. This facility matures in October&nbsp;2019. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2008, $23.2&nbsp;million was outstanding with no

has a credit agreement with a financial institution which provides for borrowing of up to
$5.0&nbsp;million. This facility matures in October&nbsp;2019. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, $4.9
million was outstanding, with no current availability for further borrowing based on available
collateral. These notes accrue interest, payable monthly, at fixed and varying rates and
are tied to various indices as noted above. For certain notes, principal payments are
required monthly or quarterly as the note dictates. Core had a $50.0&nbsp;million revolving
credit facility with a loan to value limitation of 75% for construction financing for the
development of the Tradition Hilton Head master-planned community which was subsequently
modified in 2008 to $25.0&nbsp;million. This agreement had a provision that required additional
principal payments, known as curtailment payments, in the event that actual sales were
below the contractual requirements. A curtailment payment of $14.9&nbsp;million was paid in
January&nbsp;2008. On June&nbsp;27, 2008, Core modified this loan agreement, terminating the
revolving feature of the loan and reducing an approximately $19&nbsp;million curtailment payment
due in June&nbsp;2008 to $17.0&nbsp;million, $5.0&nbsp;million of which was paid in June&nbsp;2008. The loan
was further modified in December&nbsp;2008, reducing the loan to $25&nbsp;million, eliminating the
curtailment requirements, extending the loan to February&nbsp;2012 and increasing the rate to
Prime Rate plus 1%, with a floor of 5.00%, and the establishment of an interest reserve
classified as restricted cash. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, </TD>

acquisition, development and residential construction borrowing base facility agreement
with 75% loan to value limitation and borrowed $30.2&nbsp;million under the facility (the

acre parcel in Tradition Hilton Head from Core Communities and to refinance a $15.0&nbsp;million
line of credit. In October&nbsp;2007, in connection with Woodbridge&#146;s acquisition from Levitt

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of Woodbridge&#146;s subsidiaries have borrowings which contain covenants that, among other
things, require the subsidiary to maintain financial ratios and a minimum net worth. These
requirements may limit the amount of debt that the subsidiaries can incur in the future and
restrict the payment of dividends from its subsidiaries to Woodbridge Holdings Corporation. The
loan agreements generally require repayment of specified amounts upon a sale of a portion of the
property collateralizing the debt. The land acquisition and development mortgage notes payable,
commercial development mortgage notes payable and the borrowing base facility all have loan to
value limitations. The commercial development mortgage notes payable also have debt service
coverage ratio limitations. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, Woodbridge was in compliance with all loan
agreement financial requirements and covenants. See Note 26 for further information relating on

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp has formed thirteen statutory business trusts (&#147;Trusts&#148;) which were
formed for the purpose of issuing Trust Preferred Securities (&#147;trust preferred securities&#148;) and
investing the proceeds thereof in junior subordinated debentures of BankAtlantic Bancorp. The
trust preferred securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by BankAtlantic Bancorp. The
Trusts used the proceeds from issuing trust preferred securities and the issuance of its common securities to BankAtlantic Bancorp to purchase junior subordinated
debentures from BankAtlantic Bancorp. Interest on the junior subordinated debentures and
distributions on the trust preferred securities are payable quarterly in arrears. Distributions on
the trust preferred securities are cumulative and are based upon the liquidation value of the trust
preferred security. BankAtlantic Bancorp has the right, at any time, as long as there are no
continuing events of default, to defer payments of interest on the junior subordinated debentures
for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarters; but not beyond the stated maturity of the
junior subordinated debentures. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008 no interest had been deferred. In February
and March&nbsp;2009, BankAtlantic Bancorp notified the trustees of the junior subordinated debentures
that it has elected to defer interest payments for the next regularly scheduled quarterly interest
payment dates. The deferral election will begin with respect to regularly scheduled quarterly
interest payments aggregating $3.9&nbsp;million that would otherwise have been made in March and April
of 2009. Interest will continue to accrue on the junior subordinated debentures and on the
deferred interest and BankAtlantic Bancorp will continue to recognize interest expense in its
statement of operations. During the deferral period, distributions will likewise be deferred on the
trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in
whole or in part, upon repayment of the junior subordinated debentures at maturity or their earlier
redemption. BankAtlantic Bancorp has the right to redeem the junior subordinated debentures after
five years from issuance and in some instances sooner. The redemption of the subordinated
debentures is subject to BankAtlantic Bancorp having received regulatory approval, if required
under applicable capital guidelines or regulatory policies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2002, BankAtlantic issued $22&nbsp;million of floating rate subordinated debentures due
2012. The subordinated debentures pay interest quarterly and are currently redeemable at a price
based upon then-prevailing market interest rates. The subordinated debentures were issued by
BankAtlantic in a private transaction as part of a larger pooled securities offering. The
subordinated debentures qualify for inclusion in BankAtlantic&#146;s total risk based capital.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the holder of a mortgage-backed bond issued by a financial institution acquired by BankAtlantic agreed to accept a $2.8
million payment for the retirement of $3.1&nbsp;million in mortgage-backed bonds. Included in the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations in Financial Services &#151; cost associated with debt
redemption is a $0.3&nbsp;million gain from the early extinguishment of the mortgage-backed bond.
BankAtlantic pledged $3.7&nbsp;million of residential loans as collateral for the outstanding balance
of the mortgage-back bond as of December&nbsp;31, 2008.

debentures) contain certain customary covenants found in indentures under the Trust Indenture Act,
including covenants with respect to the payment of principal and interest, maintenance of an office
or agency for administering the debentures, holding of funds for payments on the debentures in
trust, payment by BankAtlantic Bancorp of taxes and other claims, maintenance by BankAtlantic
Bancorp of its properties and its corporate existence and delivery of annual certifications to the

third parties and trust common securities to Woodbridge and used the proceeds to purchase an
identical amount of junior subordinated debentures from Woodbridge. Interest on the junior

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the development of certain of Core&#146;s projects, community development,
special assessment or improvement districts have been established and may utilize tax-exempt bond
financing to fund construction or acquisition of certain on-site and off-site infrastructure
improvements near or at these communities. The obligation to pay principal and interest on the
bonds issued by the districts is assigned to each parcel within the district, and a priority
assessment lien may be placed on benefited parcels to provide security for the debt service. The
bonds, including interest and redemption premiums, if any, and the associated priority lien on the
property are typically payable, secured and satisfied by revenues, fees, or assessments levied on
the property benefited. Core is required to pay the revenues, fees, and assessments levied by the
districts on the properties it still owns that are benefited by the improvements. Core may also be
required to pay down a specified portion of the bonds at the time each unit or parcel is sold. The
costs of these obligations are capitalized to inventory during the development period and
recognized as cost of sales when the properties are sold.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core&#146;s bond financing at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007 consisted of district bonds totaling
$218.7&nbsp;million with outstanding amounts of approximately $130.5&nbsp;million and $82.9&nbsp;million,
respectively.&nbsp;Further, at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, there was approximately $82.4&nbsp;million and
$129.5&nbsp;million, respectively, available under these bonds to fund future development expenditures.
Bond obligations at December&nbsp;31, 2008 mature in 2035 and 2040.&nbsp; As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, Core owned
approximately 16% of the property subject to assessments within the community development district
and approximately 91% of the property subject to assessments within the special assessment
district.&nbsp; During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, Core recorded approximately
$584,000, $1.3&nbsp;million and $1.7&nbsp;million, respectively, in assessments on property owned by it in
the districts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Core is responsible for any assessed amounts until the underlying property is sold
and will continue to be responsible for the annual assessments if the property is never sold.&nbsp;&nbsp; In
addition, Core has guaranteed payments for assessments under the district bonds in Tradition,
Florida which would require funding if future assessments to be allocated to property owners are
insufficient to repay the bonds.&nbsp; Management of Core has evaluated this exposure based upon the
criteria in SFAS No.&nbsp;5, <I>&#147;Accounting for Contingencies&#148;</I>, and has determined that there have been no
substantive changes to the projected density or land use in the development subject to the bond
which would make it probable that Core would have to fund future shortfalls in assessments.&nbsp;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with EITF Issue No.&nbsp;91-10, &#147;Accounting for Special Assessments and Tax Increment
Financing&#148;, Woodbridge records a liability for the estimated developer obligations that are fixed
and determinable and user fees that are required to be paid or transferred at the time the parcel
or unit is sold to an end user. &nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, the liability related to developer
obligations was $3.3&nbsp;million at each period end associated with Core&#146;s ownership of the property
and is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

representing amounts due in connection with the settlement of a class action litigation that arose
in connection with exchange transactions that the Company entered into in 1989 and 1991. The
Company is required to repay this obligation as settlement holders submit their claims to the
Company. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company paid claims of approximately
$10,300, $17,900 and $9,900, respectively, related to this obligation.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC (without consideration or reference to BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge) has a stock based compensation plan (the
&#147;2005 Stock Incentive Plan&#148;) under which restricted unvested stock, incentive stock options and
non-qualifying stock options are awarded. Under the 2005 Stock
Incentive Plan, up to 3,000,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock may be issued through restricted
stock awards and upon the exercise of options granted under the Plan. BFC may grant incentive
stock options only to its employees (as defined in the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan). BFC may grant
non-qualified stock options and restricted stock awards to directors, independent contractors and
agents as well as employees.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC also had a stock based compensation plan (&#147;1993 Plan&#148;) which expired in 2004. No future
grants can be made under the 1993 Plan; however, any previously issued options granted under that
plan remain effective until either they expire, are forfeited or are exercised. BFC&#146;s 1993 Plan
provided for the grant of stock options to purchase shares of BFC&#146;s Class&nbsp;B Common Stock. The 1993
Plan provided for the grant of both incentive stock options and non-qualifying options and the
maximum term of the options was ten years.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share-based compensation costs are recognized based on the grant date fair value. The grant
date fair value for stock options is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model net of
an estimated forfeitures rate and recognizes the compensation costs for those options expected to
vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally
the option vesting term of five years. BFC based its estimated forfeiture rate of its unvested
options on its historical experience.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assumptions used in estimating the fair value of employee options granted subsequent to
January&nbsp;1, 2006 were formulated in accordance with guidance under SFAS 123R and the guidance
provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) in Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;107
(&#147;SAB 107&#148;). As part of this assessment, management determined that volatility should be based on
the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and derived from historical price volatility using prices for
the period after the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock began trading on the NASDAQ National Market (the Class&nbsp;A
Common Stock currently trades on Pink Sheets Electronic OTC Markets) through the grant date. The
expected term of an option is an estimate as to how long the option will remain outstanding based
upon management&#146;s expectation of employee exercise and post-vesting forfeiture behavior. Because
there were no recognizable patterns, the simplified guidance in SAB 107 was used to determine the
estimated term of options issued subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R. Based on this guidance,
the term was estimated to be the midpoint of the vesting term and the contractual term. The
estimate of a risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury implied yield curve in effect
at the time of grant with a remaining term equal to the expected term. BFC has never paid cash
dividends and does not currently intend to pay cash dividends, and therefore a 0% dividend yield
was assumed.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option model used to calculate the fair value of the options granted was the Black-Scholes
model. The table below presents the weighted average assumptions used to value options granted to
employees and non-employee directors. No options were granted to employees for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, approximately $0.7&nbsp;million of total unrecognized compensation cost
was related to non-vested restricted stock compensation. The cost is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of approximately 2&nbsp;years. The fair value of shares vested during
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $0.1&nbsp;million, $0.4&nbsp;million and $0.6&nbsp;million,
respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp formulated its assumptions used in estimating the fair value of its
employee options granted subsequent to January&nbsp;1, 2006 in accordance with guidance under SFAS 123R
and the guidance provided by the SEC in Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;110 (&#147;SAB 110&#148;). As part of
this assessment, management determined that the historical volatility of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
stock should be adjusted to reflect the spin-off of Levitt Corporation (&#147;Levitt&#148;) on December&nbsp;31,
2003 because BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s historical volatility prior to the Levitt spin-off was not a
good indicator of future volatility. Management reviewed BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s stock volatility
subsequent to the Levitt spin-off along with the stock volatility of other companies in its peer
group. Based on this information, management determined that BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s stock
volatility was similar to its peer group subsequent to the Levitt spin-off. As a consequence,
management estimates BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s stock volatility over the estimated life of the stock
options granted using peer group experiences instead of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s historical data for
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic
Bancorp&#146;s stock price exhibited higher volatility than its peer group. As a consequence,
BankAtlantic Bancorp began using its historical volatility as an indicator of future volatility.
As part of its adoption of SFAS 123R, BankAtlantic Bancorp examined its historical pattern of
option exercises in an effort to determine if there were any patterns based on certain employee
populations. From this analysis, BankAtlantic Bancorp could not identify any employee population
patterns in the exercise of its options. As such, BankAtlantic Bancorp used the guidance of SAB
107 to determine the estimated term of options issued subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R.
Based on this guidance, the estimated term was deemed to be the midpoint of the vesting term and
the contractual term ((vesting term &#043; original contractual term)/2).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of Woodbridge&#146;s stock. Due to the
short period of time Woodbridge has been publicly traded, the historical volatilities of similar
publicly traded entities are reviewed to validate Woodbridge&#146;s expected volatility assumption. The
expected dividend yield is based on an expected quarterly dividend. Historically, forfeiture rates
were estimated based on historical employee turnover rates. In 2007, there were substantial
forfeitures as a result of the reductions in force related to the bankruptcy of Levitt and Sons.
See Note 6 for further explanation. As a result, Woodbridge adjusted their stock compensation to
reflect actual forfeitures. In accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;123R, companies are required to adjust
forfeiture estimates for all awards with performance and service conditions through the vesting
date so that compensation cost is recognized only for awards that vest. During the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008, there were substantial pre-vesting forfeitures as a result of the reductions in
force related to Woodbridge&#146;s restructurings and the bankruptcy of Levitt and Sons. In accordance
with SFAS No.&nbsp;123R, pre-vesting forfeitures result in a reversal of compensation cost whereas a
post-vesting cancellation would not.

option compensation offset by $1.3&nbsp;million and $1.6&nbsp;million, respectively of a reversal of stock

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actuarial estimates and assumptions are based on various market factors and are evaluated on
an annual basis, and changes in such assumptions may impact future pension costs. The discount rate
assumption is based on rates of high quality corporate bonds. The interest rates of high quality
corporate bonds remained unchanged from December&nbsp;31, 2007. The increase in the discount rate at
December&nbsp;31, 2007 reflects higher corporate bond rates at December&nbsp;31, 2007 compared to corporate
bond rates at December&nbsp;31, 2006. The expected long-term rate of return was estimated using
historical long-term returns based on the expected asset allocations. Current participant data was
used for the actuarial assumptions for each of the three years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008.
BankAtlantic did not make any contributions to its Plan during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008,
2007 and 2006. BankAtlantic will be required to contribute $1.6&nbsp;million to its Plan for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan&#146;s investment policies and strategies are to invest in mutual funds that are rated
with at least a 3-star rating awarded by Morningstar at the initial purchase. If a fund&#146;s
Morningstar rating falls below a 3-star rating after an initial purchase, it is closely monitored
to ensure that its under-performance can be attributed to market conditions rather than fund
management deficiencies. Fund manager changes or changes in fund objectives could be cause for
replacement of any mutual fund. The Plan also maintains an aggressive growth investment category
which includes investments in equity securities and mutual funds. Both public and private
securities are eligible for this category of investment, but no more than 5% of total Plan assets
at the time of the initial investment may be invested in any one company. Beyond the initial cost
limitation (5% at time of purchase), there will be no limitation as to the percentage that any one
investment can represent if it is achieved through growth. As a means to reduce negative market
volatility, and to invoke a sell discipline for concentrated positions, the Plan has a strategy of
selling call options against certain stock positions within the portfolio when considered timely.
At December&nbsp;31, 2008, 3.3% of the Plan&#146;s assets were invested in the aggressive growth category.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;109, BFC and its subsidiaries, BankAtlantic Bancorp and
Woodbridge, evaluated their deferred tax assets to determine if valuation allowances were required.
In the evaluation, management considers taxable loss carry back availability, expectations of
sufficient future taxable income, trends in earnings, existence of taxable income in recent years,
the future reversal of temporary differences, and available tax planning strategies that could be
implemented, if required. SFAS No.&nbsp;109 requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances
should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than
not standard. Based on evaluations, deferred tax valuation allowances of $28.3&nbsp;million, $90.3
million and $154.1&nbsp;million were established against the BFC, BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge,
respectively, net deferred tax assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. The deferred tax asset valuation
would be reversed when each of the companies and their respective subsidiaries generate sufficient
taxable income in the future to utilize the tax benefits of the related deferred tax assets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006, Woodbridge established a valuation allowance of $78.6&nbsp;million
and $0, respectively. BankAtlantic Bancorp established a valuation allowance of $5.4&nbsp;million and
$4.6&nbsp;million during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, as it was
BankAtlantic Bancorp management&#146;s assessment that certain State net operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;)
carry-forwards included in deferred tax assets will not be realized. BankAtlantic Bancorp files
separate State income tax returns in each State jurisdiction. Certain of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s
subsidiaries have incurred significant taxable losses for sustained periods. As a consequence,
management believed that it was more-likely-than-not that the State NOL carry forwards associated
with these companies will not be realized. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s deferred tax assets of
approximately $7.2&nbsp;million for which it has not established a valuation allowance relate to amounts
that can be realized through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences or through
carry-backs to the 2006 tax year. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, deferred tax assets includes $98.6
million of BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s federal income tax net operating loss carry-forwards that expire
in 2028 and $355.8&nbsp;million of state net operating loss carry forwards that expire from 2016 through

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to December&nbsp;31, 1996, BankAtlantic was permitted to deduct from taxable income an
allowance for bad debts which was in excess of the provision for such losses charged to income.
Accordingly, at December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic had $21.5&nbsp;million of excess allowance for bad debts
for which no provision for income tax has been provided. If, in the future, this portion of
retained earnings is distributed, or BankAtlantic no longer qualifies as a bank for tax purposes,
federal income tax of approximately $7.5&nbsp;million would be owed

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic Bancorp and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return but
separate state income tax returns. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s income tax returns for all years
subsequent to the 2003 tax year are subject to examination. Various state jurisdiction tax years
remain open to examination. BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s 2005 and 2007 federal income tax returns are
currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service. No other income tax filings are under
examination by any other taxing authority

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge valuation allowances of $154.1&nbsp;million and $78.6&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and
2007, respectively, have been established due to Woodbridge&#146;s significance losses, including losses
generated by Levitt and Sons, and significant uncertainties regarding its ability to realize these
assets. Woodbridge will be required to update its estimates of future taxable income based upon
additional information management obtains and will continue to evaluate the realizability of the
net deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, Woodbridge had federal and
Florida NOL carryforwards of approximately $191.6&nbsp;million and $191.2&nbsp;million, respectively which
expire through the year 2028. Woodbridge has established a valuation allowance for its entire

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August of 2008, Woodbridge received $29.7&nbsp;million from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
in connection with the filing of a refund claim for the carry back to 2005 and 2006 of tax losses
incurred in 2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as to income tax in multiple state
jurisdictions. Woodbridge is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state and local income tax
examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2005. The IRS commenced an examination of
Woodbridge&#146;s U.S. income tax return for 2004 in the fourth quarter of 2006 and completed its
examination in the first quarter of 2008. The conclusion of the examination resulted in a small
refund expected to be received in the second quarter of 2008 and will have an immaterial effect on
Woodbridge&#146;s results of operations or financial condition. On January&nbsp;8, 2009, Woodbridge receive
a letter from the IRS that Woodbridge and its subsidiaries has been selected for an examination of
the tax periods ending December&nbsp;31, 2005, 2006 and 2007 in connection with the 2007 tax refund
claim. The IRS examination process is in the early planning stage.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s NOL carryforwards include approximately $12.3&nbsp;million that are attributed to the
exercise of stock options since SFAS 123R was adopted. In accordance with SFAS 123R, excess tax
benefits are recognized in the financial statements upon actual realization of the related tax
benefit. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, BFC&#146;s excess tax benefit of approximately $4.7&nbsp;million was not
recognized and will not be recognized until such deductions are utilized to reduce taxes payable.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC&#146;s shift in business strategy, coupled with more recent economic developments caused the
Company to reconsider its previously disclosed tax planning strategy wherein the Company had
intended to sell BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;A Common Stock in order to generate sufficient taxable
income to utilize expiring NOLs. Because BFC believes that its best long term potential is more
likely to occur through the growth of the companies it controls, BFC&#146;s current business strategy is
to hold its investment in BankAtlantic Bancorp indefinitely and no longer intends to pursue such a
tax planning strategy. Accordingly, based on the Company&#146;s change in intent as to the expected
manner of recovery of its investment in BankAtlantic Bancorp, the Company reversed its deferred tax
liability of $29.3&nbsp;million during the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2008. BFC has the ability and
intent to increase its ownership in BankAtlantic Bancorp to a level sufficient to effectuate a
tax-free transaction.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also concluded that a valuation allowance was required because based on available
evidence it was determined that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred
tax asset will not be realized, and BFC is not generating sufficient taxable income to utilize the
benefit of the deferred tax asset. Therefore, the Company established a valuation allowance of
approximately $28.3&nbsp;million in 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation
No.&nbsp;48 &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes&#148; (&#147;FIN 48&#148;). The Company (without consideration
of BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge) had no significant adjustment upon the adoption of this
interpretation. The Company&#146;s interest in cumulative adjustments associated with the implementation
of FIN 48 by BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge increased the Company&#146;s retained earnings opening
balance and decreased liabilities in the aggregate amount of $121,000. These cumulative-effect
adjustments represent the difference between the amount of tax benefits required to be recognized
based on the application of FIN 48 and the amount of tax benefits recognized prior to the
application of FIN 48.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;31, 2008, the membership interests of two of the Company&#146;s indirect subsidiaries
which owned two South Florida shopping centers were sold to an unaffiliated third party. In
connection with the sale of the membership interests, BFC was relieved of its guarantee related to
the loans collateralized by the shopping centers, and BFC believes that any possible remaining
obligations are both remote and immaterial.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC/CCC, Inc. (&#147;BFC/CCC&#148;) has a 10% interest in a limited
partnership as a non-managing general partner. The partnership owns an office building located in
Boca Raton, Florida, and in connection with the purchase of such office building in March&nbsp;2006,
BFC/CCC guaranteed repayment of a portion of the non-recourse loan on the property on a joint and
several basis with the managing general partner. BFC/CCC&#146;s maximum exposure under this guarantee
agreement is $8.0&nbsp;million (which is shared on a joint and several basis with the managing general
partner), representing approximately 35.4% of the current indebtedness of the property, with the
guarantee to be partially reduced in the future based upon the performance of the property.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC/CCC has a 10% interest in a limited liability company that
owns two commercial properties in Hillsborough County, Florida. In connection with the purchase of
the commercial properties in November&nbsp;2006, BFC and the unaffiliated member each guaranteed the
payment of up to a maximum of $5.0&nbsp;million each for certain environmental indemnities and specific
obligations that are not related to the financial performance of the assets. BFC and the
unaffiliated member also entered into a cross indemnification agreement which limits BFC&#146;s
obligations under the guarantee to acts of BFC and its affiliates. The BFC guarantee represents
approximately 19.5% of the current indebtedness collateralized by the commercial properties.

partnership that has a 10% interest in a limited liability company that owns an office building in
Tampa, Florida. In connection with the purchase of the office building by the limited liability
company in June&nbsp;2007, BFC guaranteed the payment of certain environmental indemnities and specific
obligations that are not related to the financial performance of the asset up to a maximum of $15.0
million, or $25.0&nbsp;million in the event of any petition or involuntary proceedings under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code or similar state insolvency laws or in the event of any transfers of interests not
in accordance with the loan documents. BFC and the unaffiliated members also entered into a cross
indemnification agreement which limits BFC&#146;s obligations under the guarantee to acts of BFC and its
affiliates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend funds to a customer as long as there is no
violation of any condition established in the commitment. Commitments generally have fixed
expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the
commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements. BankAtlantic has $195.2&nbsp;million of commitments to
extend credit at a fixed interest rate and $440.9&nbsp;million of commitments to extend credit at a
variable rate. BankAtlantic evaluates each customer&#146;s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The
amount of collateral required by BankAtlantic in connection with an extension of credit is based on
management&#146;s credit evaluation of the counter-party.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by BankAtlantic to guarantee the
performance of a customer to a third party. BankAtlantic standby letters of credit are generally
issued to customers in the construction industry guaranteeing project performance. These types of
standby letters of credit had a maximum exposure of $14.1&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008.
BankAtlantic also issues standby letters of credit to commercial lending customers guaranteeing the
payment of goods and services. These types of standby letters of credit had a maximum exposure of
$6.4&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and
private borrowing arrangements and generally have maturities of one year or less. The credit risk
involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan
facilities to customers. BankAtlantic may hold certificates of deposit and residential and
commercial liens as collateral for such commitments which are collateralized similar to other types
of borrowings. Included in other liabilities at December&nbsp;31, 2008 was $20,000 of unearned
guarantee fees. There were no obligations recorded in the financial statements associated with
these guarantees.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic is required to maintain reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank. Such
reserves consisted of cash and amounts due from banks of $68.1&nbsp;million and $53.0&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the FHLB system, BankAtlantic is required to purchase and hold stock in the
FHLB of Atlanta. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008 BankAtlantic was in compliance with this requirement,
with an investment of approximately $54.6&nbsp;million in stock of the FHLB of Atlanta.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Ryan Beck sale agreement BankAtlantic Bancorp agreed to indemnify Stifel and
its affiliates against any claims of any third party losses attributable to disclosed or
undisclosed liabilities that arise out of the conduct or activities of Ryan Beck prior to the
Stifel acquisition of Ryan Beck. The indemnification of the third party losses is limited to those
losses which individually exceed $100,000, and in the aggregate exceed $3&nbsp;million with a $20
million limitation on the indemnity. Stifel recently indicated that it believes the threshold for
such obligation have been met and BankAtlantic Bancorp has requested information from Stifel in
order to determine if any amounts might be owed. Based on the information provided by Stifel,
management of BankAtlantic Bancorp believes that the obligation, if any, under the Stifel indemnity
will not have a material impact on BankAtlantic Bancorp&#146;s financial statements. The indemnified
losses include federal taxes and litigation claims.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic has terminated various operating leases originally executed for store expansion
or back-office facilities. In certain lease terminations the landlord consents to the assignment
of the lease to a third party; however, BankAtlantic remains secondarily liable for the lease
obligation. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008 BankAtlantic was secondarily liable for $11.5&nbsp;million of lease
payments. BankAtlantic uses the same credit policies in assigning these leases to third parties as
it does in originating loans. BankAtlantic recognized a lease guarantee obligation upon the
execution of the lease assignment and included in other liabilities at December&nbsp;31, 2008 was $0.2
million of unamortized lease guarantee obligations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIC is authorized to raise the assessment rates in certain circumstances, which would
affect savings institutions in all risk categories. The FDIC has exercised this authority several
times in the past and could raise rates in the future. The FDIC has proposed to adjust, and in
certain instances increase, insurance assessment rates for quarters beginning on or after April&nbsp;1,
2009 as well as impose a special assessment payable September&nbsp;30, 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tradition Development Company, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Core Communities (&#147;TDC&#148;), has
an existing advertising agreement with the operator of a Major League Baseball team pursuant to
which, among other advertising rights, TDC obtained a royalty-free license to use, among others,
the trademark &#147;Tradition Field&#148; at the sports complex located in Port St. Lucie and the naming
rights to that complex. The initial term of the agreement terminates on December&nbsp;31, 2013;
provided, however, upon payment of a specified buy-out fee and compliance with other contractual
procedures, TDC has the right to terminate the agreement at any time. Required cumulative payments
under the agreement through December&nbsp;31, 2013 are approximately $923,000.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, Woodbridge had outstanding surety bonds and letters of credit
of approximately $8.2&nbsp;million and $7.1&nbsp;million, respectively, related primarily to its obligations
to various governmental entities to construct improvements in its various communities. Woodbridge
estimates that approximately $5.0&nbsp;million of work remains to complete these improvements and does
not believe that any outstanding bonds or letters of credit will likely be drawn upon.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January of 2009, Core was advised by one of its lenders that they had received an external
appraisal on the land that serves as collateral for a development mortgage note payable with an
outstanding balance of $86.9&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008. The appraised value indicates the
potential for a remargining payment to bring the note payable back in line with the minimum
loan-to-value requirement. The lender is conducting its internal review procedures of the
appraisal, including the determination of the appraised value. As of the date of this filing, the
lender&#146;s evaluation is continuing and until such time as there is final conclusion on the part of
the lender, the amount of a possible re-margin, if any, is not determinable.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levitt and Sons had $33.3&nbsp;million in surety bonds related to its ongoing projects at the time
of the filing of the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. In the event that these obligations are drawn and paid by
the surety, Woodbridge could be responsible for up to $11.7&nbsp;million plus costs and expenses in
accordance with the surety indemnity agreements. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, Woodbridge had
$1.1&nbsp;million and $1.8&nbsp;million, respectively, in surety bonds accrual at Woodbridge related to
certain bonds for which management considers it to be probable that Woodbridge will be required to
reimburse the surety under applicable indemnity agreements. During the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2008, Woodbridge reimbursed the surety $532,000 in accordance with the indemnity agreement for bond
claims paid during the period while no reimbursements were made in 2007. It is unclear given the
uncertainty involved in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases whether and to what extent the remaining outstanding
surety bonds of Levitt and Sons will be drawn and the extent to which Woodbridge may be responsible
for additional amounts beyond this accrual. It is unlikely that Woodbridge would have the ability
to receive any repayment, assets or other consideration as recovery of any amounts it is required
to pay. The expense associated with this accrual is included in other expense in Woodbridge Other
Operations segment for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, due to its non-recurring and unusual
nature. In September&nbsp;2008, a surety filed a lawsuit to require Woodbridge to post $5.4&nbsp;million of
collateral against a portion of the $11.7&nbsp;million surety bonds exposure in connection with two
bonds totaling $5.4&nbsp;million with respect to which a municipality made claims against the surety.
Woodbridge believes that the municipality does not have the right to demand payment under the bonds
and initiated a lawsuit against the municipality and does not believe that a loss is probable.
Accordingly, Woodbridge did not accrue any amount in connection with this claim as of December&nbsp;31,
2008. As claims were made on the bonds, the surety requested Woodbridge post a $4.0&nbsp;million letter
of credit as security while the matter is litigated with the municipality, and Woodbridge has
complied with that request.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge entered into an indemnity agreement in April&nbsp;2004 with a joint venture partner at
Altman Longleaf relating to, among other obligations, that partner&#146;s guarantee of the joint
venture&#146;s indebtedness. The liability under the indemnity agreement was limited to the amount of
any distributions from the joint venture which exceeded Woodbridge&#146;s original capital and other
contributions. Original capital contributions were approximately $585,000 and Woodbridge has
received approximately $1.2&nbsp;million in distributions since 2004. In December&nbsp;2008, Woodbridge&#146;s
interest in the joint venture was sold and it received approximately $182,000 as a result of the
sale and Woodbridge was released from any potential obligation of indemnity which may have arisen
in connection with the joint venture.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is a unitary savings bank holding company that owns approximately 23% and 100%,
respectively, of the outstanding BankAtlantic Bancorp Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, in the
aggregate representing approximately 30% of all the outstanding BankAtlantic Bancorp Common Stock.
BankAtlantic Bancorp is the holding company for BankAtlantic by virtue of its ownership of 100% of
the outstanding BankAtlantic common stock. BFC is subject to regulatory oversight and examination
by the OTS as discussed herein with respect to BankAtlantic Bancorp. BankAtlantic Bancorp is a
unitary savings bank holding company subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the OTS,
including normal supervision and reporting requirements. The Company is subject to the reporting
and other requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;). BankAtlantic
Bancorp is also subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic&#146;s deposits are insured by the FDIC for up to $250,000 for each insured account
holder through December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $100,000 thereafter, the maximum amount currently permitted by
law. BankAtlantic has opted to insure its non-interest bearing and interest bearing deposits up to
50 basis point in an unlimited amount pursuant to the FDIC transaction account guarantee program.
BankAtlantic is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal
banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can cause regulators to initiate
certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions that, if undertaken, could have a
direct material effect on BankAtlantic&#146;s financial statements. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, BankAtlantic
met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject and was considered a well capitalized
institution.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability of BankAtlantic to pay dividends or make other distributions to BankAtlantic
Bancorp in subsequent periods is subject to regulations and OTS approval and is based upon
BankAtlantic&#146;s regulatory capital levels and net income. Because BankAtlantic has an accumulated
deficit during the prior two years, BankAtlantic is required to file an application to receive
approval of the OTS in order to pay dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp. While the OTS has approved
dividends to date the OTS would likely not approve any distribution that would cause BankAtlantic
to fail to meet its capital requirements or if the OTS believes that a capital distribution by
BankAtlantic constitutes an unsafe or unsound action or practice. There is no assurance that the
OTS will approve future capital distributions from BankAtlantic. During the years ended December
31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 BankAtlantic paid $15&nbsp;million, $20&nbsp;million and $20&nbsp;million, respectively,
of dividends to BankAtlantic Bancorp. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BFC
recognized approximately $208,000, $1.7&nbsp;million and $2.1&nbsp;million, respectively, of dividends from
BankAtlantic Bancorp. There are no restrictions on the payment of cash dividends by BFC. BFC has
never paid cash dividends.

as plaintiff or defendant involving its bank operations, lending, tax certificates activities and

uncertain. Management of BankAtlantic Bancorp, based on discussions with legal counsel, has
recognized legal reserves of $1.5&nbsp;million and believes its results of operations or financial

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;9, 2007, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Chapter&nbsp;11
Cases in the Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors commenced the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases in order to preserve the
value of their assets and to facilitate an orderly wind-down of their businesses and disposition of
their assets in a manner intended to maximize the recoveries of all constituents.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;27, 2007, the Office of the United States Trustee (the &#147;U.S. Trustee), appointed
an official committee of unsecured creditors in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases (the &#147;Creditors&#146; Committee&#148;).
On January&nbsp;22, 2008, the U.S. Trustee appointed a <I>Joint Home Purchase Deposit Creditors Committee
of Creditors Holding Unsecured Claims </I>(the &#147;Deposit Holders Committee&#148;, and together with the
Creditors Committee, the &#147;Committees&#148;). The Committees have a right to appear and be heard in the
Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;27, 2007, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Debtors&#146; Motion for Authority to Incur
Chapter&nbsp;11 Administrative Expense Claim (the &#147;Chapter&nbsp;11 Admin. Expense Motion&#148;), thereby
authorizing the Debtors to incur a post petition administrative expense claim in favor of
Woodbridge for administrative costs relating to certain services and benefits provided by
Woodbridge in favor of the Debtors (the &#147;Post Petition Services&#148;). While the Bankruptcy Court
approved the incurrence of the amounts as unsecured post petition administrative expense claims,
the payment of such claims is subject to additional court approval. In addition to the unsecured
administrative expense claims, Woodbridge has pre-petition secured and unsecured claims against the
Debtors. The Debtors have scheduled the amounts due to Woodbridge in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. The
unsecured pre-petition claims of Woodbridge scheduled by the Debtors are approximately $67.3
million and the secured pre-petition claim scheduled by the Debtors is approximately $460,000.
Since the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases were filed, Woodbridge has also incurred certain administrative costs
related to the Post Petition Services. These costs amounted to $1.6&nbsp;million and $748,000 in the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Additionally, as disclosed in Note 26, in the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, Woodbridge reimbursed a Levitt and Sons surety for $532,000 of bond
claims paid by the surety. No payments were made in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. The payment
by the Debtors of its outstanding advances and the Post Petition Services expenses are subject to
the risks inherent to recovery by creditors in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. Woodbridge has also filed
contingent claims with respect to any liability it may have arising out of disputed indemnification
obligations under certain surety bonds. Woodbridge also implemented

received funds as part of this program as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, which totaled approximately $3.9
million as of that date, have assigned their unsecured claims against the Debtors to Woodbridge.
It is highly unlikely that Woodbridge will recover these or any other amounts associated with its
unsecured claims against the Debtors. In addition, the Debtors asserted certain further claims
against Woodbridge, including an entitlement to a portion of the $29.7&nbsp;million federal tax refund
which Woodbridge received as a consequence of losses experienced at Levitt and Sons in prior
periods; however, the parties have entered into the Settlement Agreement described below.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;27, 2008, Woodbridge entered into a settlement agreement (the &#147;Settlement Agreement&#148;)
with the Debtors and the Joint Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the &#147;Joint Committee&#148;) appointed
in the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, among other things, (i)&nbsp;Woodbridge
agreed to pay to the Debtors&#146; bankruptcy estates the sum of $12.5&nbsp;million plus accrued interest
from May&nbsp;22, 2008 through the date of payment, (ii)&nbsp;Woodbridge agreed to waive and release
substantially all of the claims it had against the Debtors, including its administrative expense
claims through July&nbsp;2008, and (iii)&nbsp;the Debtors (joined by the Joint Committee) agreed to waive and
release any claims they had against Woodbridge and its affiliates. After certain of Levitt and
Sons&#146; creditors indicated that they objected to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and stated a
desire to pursue claims against Woodbridge, Woodbridge, the Debtors and the Joint Committee agreed
in principal to an amendment to the Settlement Agreement, pursuant to which Woodbridge would, in
lieu of the $12.5&nbsp;million payment previously agreed to, pay $8.0&nbsp;million to the Debtors&#146; bankruptcy
estates and place $4.5&nbsp;million in a release fund to be disbursed to third party creditors in
exchange for a third party release and injunction. The amendment also provided for an additional
$300,000 payment by Woodbridge to a deposit holders fund. The Settlement Agreement, as amended, was
subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

Debtors&#146; projects. Under the agreements for the DIP Loans, the DIP Loans are to be used for (i)&nbsp;the

such other costs and expenses related to the DIP Loans or the projects as the DIP Lender may elect.
The Bankruptcy Court&#146;s order approving the DIP Loans also approved the sales of homes in the
projects with the net proceeds from such sales being applied towards the DIP Loans. The order also
appointed a Chief Administrator to manage and supervise all administrative functions of these
Debtors related to the projects in accordance with the scope of authority set forth in the DIP Loan
agreements. These projects represent 89.7% of the total assets, 66.3% of the total liabilities and
34.1% of the shareholders deficit of Levitt and Sons at December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the DIP Loans financed construction and development
activities and selling, general and administrative expenses related to the projects, as well as the
costs, fees and other expenses of the DIP Lender, including interest expense. Additionally, during
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, homes in the projects have been sold and closed, resulting in the
receipt by the Debtors of sales proceeds. The Chief Administrator is maintaining the accounting
records for these transactions in accordance with the DIP Loan agreements and, as a result,
financial information is not available to Woodbridge which could be used to record these
transactions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles on a basis consistent with
Woodbridge&#146;s accounting for similar transactions. Accordingly, these transactions have not been
reflected in the financial information for Levitt and Sons included in Note 37 to the consolidated
financial statements. However, as described herein, due to the deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons
from Woodbridge&#146;s statements of financial condition and results of operations as of November&nbsp;9,
2007, these transactions, and the omission of the results of these transactions, will not have an
impact on Woodbridge&#146;s financial condition or operating results.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;25, 2008, plaintiff Robert D. Dance filed a purported class action complaint as a
putative purchaser of Woodbridge&#146;s securities against Woodbridge and certain of its officers and
directors, asserting claims under the federal securities law and seeking damages. This action was
filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and is captioned
Dance v. Levitt Corp. et al., No.&nbsp;08-CV-60111-DLG. The securities litigation purports to be
brought on behalf of all purchasers of Woodbridge&#146;s securities beginning on January&nbsp;31, 2007 and
ending on August&nbsp;14, 2007. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and
20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule&nbsp;10b-5 promulgated there under by issuing a series of false

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2008, a surety filed a lawsuit to require Woodbridge to post $5.4&nbsp;million of
collateral in connection with two bonds totaling $5.4&nbsp;million with respect to which a municipality
made claims against the surety. Woodbridge believes that the municipality does not have the right
to demand payment under the bonds and Woodbridge initiated a lawsuit against the municipality and
do not believe that a loss is probable. Accordingly, Woodbridge did not accrue any amount related
to this claim as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. As claims were made on the bonds, the surety requested
Woodbridge post a $4.0&nbsp;million letter of credit as security while the matter is litigated with the
municipality and Woodbridge has complied with that request.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;157 defines fair value as the price that would be received on the sale of an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. The Statement also defines valuation techniques and a fair value hierarchy to
prioritize the inputs used in valuation techniques. There are three main valuation techniques to
measuring fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the
cost approach. The input fair value hierarchy has three broad levels and gives the highest
priority to quoted prices (unadjusted)&nbsp;in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level
1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valuation techniques are summarized below:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income approach uses financial models to convert future amounts to a single present
amount. These valuation techniques include present value and option-pricing models.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the
service capacity of an asset. This technique is often referred to as current replacement costs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The input fair value hierarchy is summarized below:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted)&nbsp;in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at each reporting date. An active market for
the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. A quoted price
in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and is used to measure fair
value whenever available.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable
for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a
specified (contractual)&nbsp;term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of
the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in
active markets; Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are
not active, that is, markets in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the
prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market
makers (for example, some brokered markets), or in which little information is released publicly
(for example, a principal-to-principal market); Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable
for the asset or liability (for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly
quoted intervals, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and default
rates).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are
only used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby
allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or
liability at the measurement date.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $3.7&nbsp;million of gains for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 represents realized gains
relating to the sale of Stifel warrants. The $3.4&nbsp;million equity securities loss represents an
other-than-temporary impairment associated with a decline in value related to an equity investment
in an unrelated financial institution. The Company also recorded a $3.6&nbsp;million other-than-temporary impairment of its investment in Benihana Convertible Preferred Stock (see Note&nbsp;12).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valuation techniques and the inputs used in our financial statements to measure the fair
value of our recurring financial instruments are described below.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair values of mortgage-backed and real estate mortgage conduit securities are estimated
using independent pricing sources and matrix pricing. Matrix pricing uses a market approach
valuation technique and Level 2 valuation inputs as quoted market prices are not available for the
specific securities that BankAtlantic owns. The independent pricing sources value these
securities using observable market inputs including: benchmark yields, reported trades,
broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads and other reference data in the secondary institutional
market which is the principal market for these types of assets. To validate fair values obtained
from the pricing sources, BankAtlantic reviews fair value estimates obtained from brokers,
investment advisors and others to determine the reasonableness of the fair values obtained from
independent pricing sources. BankAtlantic reviews any price that it determines may not be
reasonable and requires the pricing sources to explain the differences in fair value or reevaluate
its fair value.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonds and equity securities are generally fair valued using the market approach and quoted
market prices (Level 1) or matrix pricing (Level 2 or Level 3) with inputs obtained from
independent pricing sources to value bonds and equity securities, if available. Also non-binding
broker quotes are obtained to validate fair values obtained from matrix pricing. However, for
certain equity and debt securities in which observable market inputs cannot be obtained, these
securities are valued either using the income approach and pricing models that we developed or
based on observable market data that we have adjusted based on our judgment of the factors a market
participant would use to value the securities (Level 3).

by FAS 157, whereby BFC&#146;s valuation technique was to measure the fair value
based upon the income approach by discounting the cash flows at a market discount rate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impaired loans are generally valued based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.
BankAtlantic primarily uses third party appraisals to assist in measuring impaired loans. These
appraisals generally use the market or income approach valuation technique and use market
observable data to formulate an opinion of the fair value of the loan&#146;s collateral. However, the
appraiser uses professional judgment in determining the fair value of the collateral or properties
and BankAtlantic may also adjust these values for changes in market conditions subsequent to the
appraisal date. When current appraisals are not available for certain loans, BankAtlantic uses
judgment on market conditions to adjust the most current appraisal. The sales prices may reflect
prices of sales contracts not closed and the amount of time required to sell out the real estate
project may be derived from current appraisals of similar projects. As a consequence, the fair
value of the collateral is considered a Level 3 valuation.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private investment securities represent investments in limited partnerships that invest in
equity securities based on proprietary investment strategies. The underlying equity investments in
these limited partnerships are generally publicly traded equity securities and the fair values of
these securities are obtained from the general partner. As the fair values of the underlying
securities in the limited partnership were obtained from the general partner and the inputs used
are proprietary to the limited partnership and not known to the Company, the fair value assigned to
these investments is considered Level 3.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">of these financial instruments using the income approach technique with Level 3 unobservable
inputs, there is no assurance that the Company would receive the estimated value upon sale or
disposition of the asset. Management estimates used in its net present value financial models rely
on assumptions and judgments regarding issues where the outcome is unknown and actual results or
values may differ significantly from these estimates. The Company&#146;s fair value estimates do not
consider the tax effect that would be associated with the disposition of the assets or liabilities
at their fair value estimates.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair values are estimated for loan portfolios with similar financial characteristics. Loans
are segregated by category, and each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable
rate interest terms and by performing and non-performing categories.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of performing loans, except residential mortgage and adjustable rate loans is
calculated by using an income approach with level 3 inputs. The fair value of performing loans is
estimated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market
discount rates that reflect the interest rate risk inherent in the loan. The estimate of average
maturity is based on BankAtlantic&#146;s historical experience with prepayments for each loan
classification, modified as required, by an estimate of the effect of current economic and lending
conditions. Management assigned a credit risk premium to these loans based on risk grades and
delinquency status for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of tax certificates was calculated using the income approach. The fair value
is based on discounted expected cash flows using discount rates that take into account the risk of
the cash flows of tax certificates relative to alternative investments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest bearing demand
deposits, savings and NOW accounts, and money market and checking accounts, is considered the same
as book value. The fair value of certificates of deposit is based on an income approach with Level
3 inputs. The fair value is calculated by the discounted value of contractual cash flows with the
discount rate estimated using current rates offered by BankAtlantic for similar remaining
maturities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank stock is its carrying amount.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased
is calculated using the income approach with Level 2 inputs. Contractual cash flows are discounted
based on current interest rates. The carrying value of these borrowings approximates fair value as
maturities are generally less than thirty days.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of FHLB advances was calculated using the income approach. The fair value was
based on discounted cash flows using rates offered for debt with comparable terms to maturity and
issuer credit standing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of Stifel warrants as of December&nbsp;31, 2007 was based on an option pricing
model.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair values of subordinated debentures and mortgage and notes payable were based on
discounted values of contractual cash flows at a market discount rate adjusted for non-performance
risk for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008.

based on a December&nbsp;2008 trade with an unrelated financial institution. The fair value of
BankAtlantic&#146;s mortgage-backed bond for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 was based on discounted
values of contractual cash flows at a market discount rate.

price quotes as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007. The fair value of the remaining junior subordinated
debentures was obtained using the income approach by discounting estimated cash flows at a market
discount rate. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the discount rate was adjusted for
non-performance risk (Level 3).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Derivatives</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commitments to originate residential loans held for sale and to sell residential loans are
derivatives. The fair value of these derivatives was not included in the Company&#146;s financial
statements as the amount was not considered significant. These derivatives relate to a loan
origination program with an independent mortgage company where the mortgage company purchases the
originated loans from BankAtlantic 14&nbsp;days after the funding date at a price negotiated quarterly
for all loans sold during the quarter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in the proceeds received from the February&nbsp;2007 sale of Ryan Beck to Stifel were
warrants to acquire 722,586 shares of Stifel common stock at $24.00 per share. During the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, all of the Stifel warrants were sold for a gain of $3.7&nbsp;million.
BankAtlantic Bancorp received gross proceeds of $14.4&nbsp;million from the sale of the warrants.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on market conditions, BankAtlantic writes call options on recently purchased agency
securities (&#147;covered calls&#148;). Included in the Statement of Operations in Financial Services
securities activities &#151; net during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was covered
call transaction gains of $0.4&nbsp;million, $0 and $0.2&nbsp;million, respectively. BankAtlantic Bancorp
had no call options outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Concentration of Credit Risk</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic purchases residential loans located throughout the country. Included in these
purchased residential loans are interest-only loans. These loans result in possible future
increases in a borrower&#146;s loan payments when the contractually required repayments increase due to
interest rate movement and the required amortization of the principal amount. These payment
increases could affect a borrower&#146;s ability to repay the loan and lead to increased defaults and
losses. At December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, BankAtlantic&#146;s residential loan portfolio included $979
million and $1.1&nbsp;billion of interest-only loans with 25% of the principal amount of these loans
secured by collateral located in California. BankAtlantic manages this credit risk by purchasing
interest-only loans originated to borrowers that it believes to be credit worthy, with
loan-to-value and total debt to income ratios within agency guidelines. Thus, these purchased
residential loans are not sub-prime loans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BankAtlantic has a high concentration of consumer home equity and commercial loans in the
State of Florida. Real estate values and general economic conditions have significantly
deteriorated during 2008. If the market conditions in Florida do not improve during 2009 or
deteriorate further BankAtlantic may be exposed to significant credit losses.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC is the controlling shareholder of BankAtlantic Bancorp and Woodbridge. BFC also has a
direct non-controlling interest in Benihana and, through Woodbridge, an indirect ownership interest
in Bluegreen. The majority of BFC&#146;s voting capital stock is owned or controlled by the Company&#146;s

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;7, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company designated 15,000 shares of the
preferred stock as 5% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (&#147;5% Preferred Stock&#148;) and, on June
21, 2004, sold the shares of the Preferred Stock to an investor group in a private offering. On
December&nbsp;17, 2008, certain of the designated relative rights, preference and limitations of the
Company&#146;s 5% Preferred Stock were amended as indicated below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;17, 2008, the Company amended Article&nbsp;IV of the Company&#146;s Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation (the &#147;Amendment&#148;) with the Florida Department of State to amend certain
of the previously designated relative rights, preferences and limitations of the Company&#146;s 5%
Preferred Stock. The Amendment eliminates the right of the holders of the 5% Preferred Stock to
convert their shares of 5% Preferred Stock into shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock. The
Amendment also requires the Company to redeem shares of the 5% Preferred Stock with the net
proceeds it receives in the event (i)&nbsp;the Company sells any of its shares of Series&nbsp;B Convertible
Preferred Stock (the &#147;Benihana Preferred Stock&#148;) of Benihana, Inc. (&#147;Benihana&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;the Company
sells any shares of Benihana&#146;s common stock received upon conversion of the Benihana Preferred
Stock or (iii)&nbsp;Benihana redeems any shares of the Benihana Preferred Stock owned by the Company.
Additionally, in the event the Company defaults on its obligation to make dividend payments on the
5% Preferred Stock, the Amendment entitles the holders of the 5% Preferred Stock, in place of the
Company, to receive directly from Benihana certain payments on the shares of Benihana Preferred
Stock owned by the Company or on the shares of Benihana&#146;s common stock received by the Company upon
conversion of the Benihana Preferred Stock. The investment in Benihana Preferred Stock is subject
to mandatory redemption on July&nbsp;2, 2014. The date may be extended by the holders of a majority of
the then outstanding shares of Benihana Preferred Stock to a date no later than July&nbsp;2, 2024.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective with the Amendment in December&nbsp;2008 and in accordance with <I>Accounting Series Release No.&nbsp;268 (&#147;ASR 268&#148;)</i>, the Company
determined that the 5% Preferred Stock met the requirements to be re-classified outside of
permanent equity at its fair value at the Amendment date of approximately $11.0&nbsp;million into the
mezzanine category as Redeemable 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock at December&nbsp;31, 2008 in the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The fair value of the 5% Preferred Stock
was obtained by using an income approach by discounting estimated cash flows at a market discount
rate. Prior to the Amendment in December&nbsp;2008 for all periods presented, the 5% Preferred Stock is
presented in permanent equity at its stated value of approximately $15.0&nbsp;million. At December&nbsp;31,
2008, $11.0&nbsp;million was re-classified as Redeemable 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock and the remaining
amount of approximately $4.0&nbsp;million remains classified in Additional Paid in Capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5% Preferred Stock has a stated value of $1,000 per share. The shares of 5% Preferred
Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Company, from time to time, at redemption prices (the
&#147;Redemption Price&#148;) ranging from $1,030 per share for the year 2009 to $1,000 per share for the
year 2015 and thereafter. The 5% Preferred Stock liquidation preference is equal to its stated
value of $1,000 per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends or an amount equal to the
Redemption Price in a voluntary liquidation or winding up of the Company. Holders of the 5%
Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, cumulative
quarterly cash dividends on each such share at a rate per annum of 5% of the stated value from the
date of issuance, payable quarterly. Since June&nbsp;2004, the Company has paid dividends on the 5%
Preferred Stock of $187,500 on a quarterly basis. The 5% Preferred Stock has no voting rights
except as required by Florida law.

share pursuant to a registered underwritten public offering. Net proceeds from the sale of the
11,500,000 shares by the Company totaled approximately $36.1&nbsp;million, after deducting underwriting
discounts, commissions and offering expenses. The Company primarily used the proceeds of this
offering to purchase in Woodbridge&#146;s Rights Offering approximately 16.6&nbsp;million shares of
Woodbridge&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $33.2&nbsp;million, and for general
corporate purposes, including working capital.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;7, 2005, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase the
authorized number of shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, from
20&nbsp;million shares to 70&nbsp;million shares. The amendment was approved by the written consent of the
holders of shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Common Stock representing a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast by all shareholders on the amendment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Articles of Incorporation authorize the Company to issue both Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock, par value $.01 per share, and a Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, par value $.01 per share. On May&nbsp;22,
2002, the Company&#146;s Articles of Incorporation were amended to, among other things, grant holders of
the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock one vote for each share held, with all holders of Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock possessing in the aggregate 22% of the total voting power. Prior to the amendment, the Class
A Common Stock had no voting rights except under limited circumstances provided by Florida law.
The amendment provided for the holders of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock to have the remaining 78% of the
total voting power. When the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock outstanding decreases to
1,800,000 shares, the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock aggregate voting power will increase to 40% and the
Class&nbsp;B Common Stock will have the remaining 60%. When the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock
outstanding decreases to 1,400,000 shares, the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock aggregate voting power will
increase to 53% and the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock will have the remaining 47%. These relative voting
percentages will remain fixed unless the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock outstanding
decreases to 500,000 shares or less, at which time the fixed voting percentages will be eliminated.
Also, each share of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock is convertible at the option of the holder thereof into
one share of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock.

(the &#147;By-laws&#148;), to include advance notice procedures requiring, among other things, that a
shareholder wishing to properly bring business before an annual meeting of the Company&#146;s
shareholders or nominate a candidate to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company must deliver
written notice of such business or nomination to the Company&#146;s Secretary (i)&nbsp;not less than 90&nbsp;days

the Company&#146;s shareholders or (ii)&nbsp;in the event that the annual meeting of the Company&#146;s

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter, a goodwill impairment of approximately $46.6&nbsp;million (net of
purchase accounting) was recognized and an $81.3&nbsp;million deferred tax valuation allowance was
established. Real estate values and the general economy continued to deteriorate resulting in a
$38.5&nbsp;million provision for loan losses. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, Woodbridge
established an additional impairment on its investment in Bluegreen and its investment in
unconsolidated trusts of approximately $40.8&nbsp;million and $2.1&nbsp;million, respectively, as well as an
impairment charge on its investment in Office Depot of approximately $12.0&nbsp;million. Also, in December 2008,
BFC recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $3.6 million on its investment in Benihana Convertible Preferred Stock <font style="white-space: nowrap">(see Note 12).</font>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were material decreases in the results of operations in the fourth quarter of 2007
primarily related to the deconsolidation of Levitt and Sons as of November&nbsp;9, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth quarter expenses included $5.7&nbsp;million in restructuring costs and exit activities
related to the decision to slow BankAtlantic&#146;s store expansion as well as higher provisions for
loan losses associated with home equity and commercial residential real estate loans. BankAtlantic
Bancorp operations were unfavorably impacted by a $3.3&nbsp;million other-than-temporary impairment of a
private investment and a $2.7&nbsp;million unrealized loss associated with Stifel Warrants.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of 2007 Woodbridge recorded $2.5&nbsp;million in certain restructuring
related expenses consisting of independent contractor agreements, and facilities expense. See Note
6 for further details.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As described in (Note 1) above, on November&nbsp;9, 2007, the Debtors filed the Chapter&nbsp;11
Cases. The Debtors commenced the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases in order to preserve the value of their assets
and to facilitate an orderly wind-down of their businesses and disposition of their assets in a
manner intended to maximize the recoveries of all constituents. In connection with the filing of
the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases, Woodbridge deconsolidated Levitt and Sons as of November&nbsp;9, 2007. As a result
of the deconsolidation, Woodbridge had a negative basis in its investment in Levitt and Sons
because Levitt and Sons generated significant losses and intercompany liabilities in excess of its
asset balances. This negative investment, &#147;Loss in excess of investment in Woodbridge&#146;s
subsidiary&#148;, is reflected as a single amount on Woodbridge&#146;s consolidated statements of financial
condition as a $55.2&nbsp;million liability as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007. This balance was comprised
of a negative investment in Levitt and Sons of $123.0&nbsp;million, and outstanding advances due to
Woodbridge from Levitt and Sons of $67.8&nbsp;million. Included in the negative investment was
approximately $15.8&nbsp;million associated with deferred revenue related to intra-segment sales between
Levitt and Sons and Core Communities. During the fourth quarter of 2008, Woodbridge identified

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">approximately $2.3&nbsp;million of deferred revenue on intercompany sales between Core and Carolina Oak
that had been misclassified against the negative investment in Levitt and Sons. As a result,
Woodbridge recorded a $2.3&nbsp;million reclassification between inventory of real estate and the loss
in excess of investment in subsidiary in the consolidated statements of financial condition. As a
result, as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the net negative investment was $52.9&nbsp;million. Woodbridge&#146;s
previously reported consolidated statements of financial condition, consolidated statements of
operations and consolidated statements of cash flows prior to November&nbsp;9, 2007 continue to include
Levitt and Sons&#146; financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See (Note 30) for
further information regarding the Chapter&nbsp;11 Cases and Note 38 for the status of the Settlement
Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Levitt and Sons&#146; results are no longer consolidated with Woodbridge&#146;s results, and
Woodbridge believes it is not probable that it will be obligated to fund further losses related to
its investment in Levitt and Sons, any material uncertainties related to Levitt and Sons&#146; ongoing
operations are not expected to impact Woodbridge&#146;s future financial results other than in
connection with Woodbridge&#146;s contractual obligations to third parties and payment of the settlement
amount.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;20, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court presiding over Levitt and Sons&#146; Chapter&nbsp;11
bankruptcy case entered an order confirming a plan of liquidation jointly proposed by Levitt and
Sons and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. That order also approved the settlement
pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, as amended. No appeal or rehearing of the court&#146;s order was
timely filed by any party, and the settlement was consummated on March&nbsp;3, 2009, at which time,
payment was made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement as
amended. The cost of the settlement and reversal of the related $52.9&nbsp;million liability will be
recognized into income in the first quarter of 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Executive Compensation Program</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;29, 2008, Woodbridge&#146;s Board of Directors approved the terms of incentive
programs for certain of its employees including certain of Woodbridge&#146;s named executive officers,
pursuant to which a portion of their compensation will be based on the cash returns realized by
Woodbridge on its investments. The programs relate to the performance of existing investments and
new investments designated by the Board (together, the &#147;Investments&#148;). All of Woodbridge&#146;s
investments have been or will be held by individual limited partnerships or other legal entities
established for such purpose. Participating executives and employees will have interests in the
entities which will be the basis of their incentives under the programs. Woodbridge&#146;s named
executive officers may have interests tied both to the performance of a particular investment as
well as interests relating to the performance of the portfolio of investments as a whole.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge, in its capacity as investor in the investment program, will be entitled to receive
a return of Woodbridge&#146;s invested capital and a specified rate of return on its invested capital
prior to its executive officers or employees being entitled to receive any portion of the realized
profits (the share to which they may be entitled is referred to as the &#147;Carried Interest&#148;). For
existing investments, the amount of invested capital was determined as of September&nbsp;1, 2008, by
Woodbridge&#146;s board of directors. Once Woodbridge receives its priority return of its invested
capital and the stated return (which accrues from September&nbsp;1, 2008), Woodbridge will also
generally be entitled to additional amounts that provide it with (i)&nbsp;at least approximately 87% of
the aggregate proceeds related to Woodbridge&#146;s status as an investor in excess of Woodbridge&#146;s
invested capital in that investment, plus (ii)&nbsp;at least

income not related to Woodbridge&#146;s status as an investor, such as management fees charged to third
parties). The remaining proceeds will be available under the incentive programs for distribution
among those employees directly responsible for the relevant Investments and Woodbridge&#146;s executive
officers. The compensation committee of Woodbridge&#146;s board of directors will determine the
allocations to its named executive officers. These allocations are identified in advance for each
of the executive officers. Although the compensation committee can alter these allocations on a
prospective basis, the total amount payable to employees and officers cannot be changed.
Management of Woodbridge will determine the amounts to be allocated among the other employee
participants. The incentive programs relating to both individual investments and the program
established for the executive officers with respect to the overall performance of the portfolio of
investments contain clawback obligations that are intended to reduce the risk that the participants
will be distributed amounts under the programs prior to Woodbridge&#146;s receipt of at least a return
of its invested capital and the stated return. The programs contemplate that the clawback
obligations will be funded solely from holdback accounts established with respect to each
participant. Amounts equal to a portion of Carried Interest distribution to such participant
(initially 25% and which can be increased, when appropriate, to as high as 75%) will be deposited
into holdback accounts or otherwise made available for the benefit of Woodbridge. There are also
general vesting and forfeiture provisions applicable to each participant&#146;s right to receive any
Carried Interest, the terms of which may vary by individual. Woodbridge&#146;s board of directors
believes that the above-described incentive plans Plan appropriately aligns payments to
participants with the performance of its Investments.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) to make known material information concerning the Company, including its
subsidiaries, to those officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of our
senior management. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, our management carried out an evaluation, with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer,
of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer,
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that, as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief
Accounting Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all improper conduct. A control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must
be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
improper conduct, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
Further, the design of any control system is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f). Internal control over
financial reporting includes controls over the preparation of financial statements in accordance
with the instruction to the consolidated financial statements for savings and loan holding
companies (OTS Form&nbsp;H-(b) 11) to comply with the reporting requirements of Section&nbsp;112 of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. Our internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and
Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework in <I>Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on such
evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2008.
