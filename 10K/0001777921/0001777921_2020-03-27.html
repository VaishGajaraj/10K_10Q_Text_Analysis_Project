combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own

company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives
of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination
if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires
a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders
prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on
valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which
we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we
would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares,
our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares
subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses
are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is
what will be taken into account for purposes of NASDAQ&rsquo;s 80% fair market value test. If the initial business combination
involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions
and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking
stockholder approval, as applicable.</P>

business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with
stockholders&rsquo; interests than it would as a private company. A target business can further benefit by augmenting its profile
among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. In a business combination transaction with
us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares of
Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our shares of Class A common stock and cash,
allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers.</P>

associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective
method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes
a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses
in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show efforts that
may not be present to the same extent in connection with an initial business combination with us.</P>

combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always
subject to the underwriters&rsquo; ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or
prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an initial business combination, we
believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives
consistent with stockholders&rsquo; interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company
can offer further benefits by augmenting a company&rsquo;s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting
talented employees.</P>

trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at
the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of our
initial business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by
the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses
or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M&amp;A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not
able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent
investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction
of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination
of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with
the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target&rsquo;s assets
or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business

blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.</P>

underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement
with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and (along with
Cantor) placement shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.</P>

the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock upon the completion of our initial business

a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the
transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange
listing requirement. Under NASDAQ rules, asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval
while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding
common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure
an initial business combination with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion
as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed initial business combination. We may conduct redemptions without
a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange
listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain
a listing for our securities on NASDAQ, we are required to comply with such rules.</P>

of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count toward this quorum and pursuant to the letter

purchased (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes
of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval
of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders&rsquo; founder
shares and placement shares, we would need only 12,720,001, or 36.3%, of the 35,000,000 public shares sold in our initial public
offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our
initial business combination approved. We intend to give approximately 30&nbsp;days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60
days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination.
These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will

stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business
combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder,
together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a &ldquo;group&rdquo;
(as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than
an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as the &ldquo;Excess Shares.&rdquo; Such
restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating
large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against
a proposed initial business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium
to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding an aggregate
of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder&rsquo;s
shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By
limiting our stockholders&rsquo; ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our
prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability
to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination with a target that
requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting
our stockholders&rsquo; ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.</P>

DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder&rsquo;s option. The proxy materials that we will furnish to holders
of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders
to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have up to two days prior to the vote on the initial
business combination to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise
period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.</P>

agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to
the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption
rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing
of when such delivery must be effectuated.</P>

It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed

held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements
or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but
not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging
the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including
the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held
in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement
with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party&rsquo;s engagement would be significantly
more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute
a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to
be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable
to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. WithumSmith+Brown, PC, our independent registered public accounting firm,
and Cantor, the underwriters of the offering, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the
trust account.</P>

be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective
target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination
agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual

our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient
funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor&rsquo;s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore,
we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify
us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.</P>

that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such

liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The
pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event
we do not complete our initial business combination by September 19, 2021 may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware
law. Delaware law provides that if a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended
to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party
claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and
an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders
with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&rsquo;s pro rata share of the claim or
the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of
the dissolution.</P>

trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our
initial business combination by September 19, 2021, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption
distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to
other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims
of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating
distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by September 19, 2021, we will: (i) cease all operations
except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem
the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000
of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely
extinguish public stockholders&rsquo; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions,
if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval
of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii)
above to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly,
it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following September 19, 2021 and, therefore, we
do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent
of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary

Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment
of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However,
because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations are limited to searching for prospective
target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, and
auditors) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement,
we have sought and will continue to seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditor), prospective
target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or
claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made
against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust
account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account
are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the
date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of
interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial
public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver
is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such
third-party claims.</P>

from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and

and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of
these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target
businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders
who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding
warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either
of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.</P>

on a given economy. Although the long-term effect of diseases such as the COVID-19 &ldquo;coronavirus,&rdquo; H5N1 &ldquo;avian
flu,&rdquo; or H1N1, the &ldquo;swine flu,&rdquo; cannot currently be predicted, previous occurrences of avian flu and swine flu
had an adverse effect on the economies of those countries in which they were most prevalent. An outbreak of a communicable disease
in our market could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and timely reporting obligations

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus
was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout China and other parts of the world,
including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) a &ldquo;Public Health Emergency of International Concern.&rdquo; On January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services
Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding
to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a &ldquo;pandemic&rdquo;. A significant
outbreak of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies
and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential target business with which we consummate a business combination
could be materially and adversely affected.&nbsp; The recent market decline and volatility in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic
could also materially and adversely affect a potential target&rsquo;s willingness to consummate a business combination with us.
Furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limit
the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company&rsquo;s personnel, vendors and services providers are
unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a
business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information
which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If
the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate
a business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may
be materially adversely affected.</P>

combination agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition
and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the initial business combination. Furthermore, we will only redeem our public
shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon
consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters&rsquo; fees and commissions (so that we are
not subject to the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may
be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption
requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition,

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">At the time we enter into an agreement for
our initial business combination, we will not know how many stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will
need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If
our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price,
or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account
to meet such requirements, or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption
than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account
or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence
of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. Furthermore, this dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution
provision of the Class B common stock result in the issuance of Class A shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion
of the Class B common stock at the time of our business combination. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete
the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure. The amount of the deferred underwriting
commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business
combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be
reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the per-share value of shares held by non-redeeming
stockholders will reflect our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commissions.</P>

Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which
are referred to as &ldquo;covered securities.&rdquo; Because our units, our Class A common stock and warrants are listed on NASDAQ,
our units, Class A common stock and our warrants are covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the
sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and,
if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular
case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank
check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and
might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states.
Further, if we were no longer listed on NASDAQ, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation
in each state in which we offer our securities, including in connection with our initial business combination.</P>

business that has not been identified, we may be deemed to be a &ldquo;blank check&rdquo; company under the United States securities

protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors are not afforded the benefits or protections
of those rules. Among other things, this means that we have a longer period of time to complete our business combination than do
companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, if our initial public offering were subject to Rule 419, that rule would prohibit the
release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released
to us in connection with our completion of an initial business combination.</P>

to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which
may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities competing for the types of businesses
we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying
and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many
of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more industry knowledge than we do, and our financial
resources are relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target
businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the placement units,
our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable is limited by our available
financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target
businesses. Furthermore, because we are obligated to pay cash for the shares of Class A common stock which our public stockholders
redeem in connection with our initial business combination, target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available
to us for our initial business combination. This may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial
business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately
$10.00 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our
public stockholders may receive less than $10.00 per share upon our liquidation.</P>

offering and the sale of the placement units, only approximately $994,800 (as of December 31, 2019) will be available to us outside
the trust account to fund our working capital requirements. If we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow
funds from our sponsor, management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. None of our sponsor, members
of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances. Any such
advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial
business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option
of the lender, upon consummation of our initial business combination. The units would be identical to the placement units. Prior
to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an
affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any
and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. If we are unable to obtain these loans, we may be unable to complete
our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient
funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. Consequently, our public stockholders

on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will surface all material issues that may
be present inside a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount
of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of
these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other
charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected
risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Although
these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this
nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause
us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target
business or by virtue of our obtaining debt financing to partially finance the initial business combination. Accordingly, any stockholders
who choose to remain stockholders following the initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares.
Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the
reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they
are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as
applicable, relating to the initial business combination constituted an actionable material misstatement or omission.</P>

may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective
target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or
claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not
execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust
account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well
as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against
our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims
to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only
enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party&rsquo;s
engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. WithumSmith+Brown, PC, our independent registered

or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver
or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee
that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations,
contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public
shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of
a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of
creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share
redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.00 per share initially held in the trust account,
due to claims of such creditors. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third
party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written
letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust
account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account

who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable)
nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations,
nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that
our sponsor&rsquo;s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to
satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation,

company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily
in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting,
owning, holding or trading &ldquo;investment securities&rdquo; constituting more than 40% of our total assets (exclusive of U.S.
government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and complete an initial business
combination and thereafter to operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses

subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account may only be invested in United States
&ldquo;government securities&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180
days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which
invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest
in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan
targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a
merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an &ldquo;investment company&rdquo; within the meaning of
the Investment Company Act. The trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of: (i) the
completion of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with
a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we
do not complete our initial business combination by September 19, 2021 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders&rsquo;
rights or pre-initial business combination activity; or (iii) absent an initial business combination by September 19, 2021, our
return of the funds held in the trust account to our public stockholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If we
do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed
to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses
for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete an initial business combination or may result in our
liquidation. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately
$10.00 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.</P>

pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event
we do not complete our initial business combination by September 19, 2021 may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware
law. If a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable
provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against
the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting
period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating
distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&rsquo;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the
stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is
our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following September 19, 2021 in the event we do not complete
our initial business combination and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the foregoing procedures.</P>

280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our
payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10 years following our
dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited
to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers,
investment bankers, and auditors) or prospective target businesses. If our plan of distribution complies with Section 281(b) of
the DGCL, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&rsquo;s
pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would likely be
barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be
potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions
received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date. Furthermore,
if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in
the event we do not complete our initial business combination by September 19, 2021 is not considered a liquidating distribution
under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings
that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the
statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three
years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution.</P>

reference therein are not current or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants
issued in our initial public offering are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise
their warrants on a cashless basis. However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be

settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register

there is no exemption available. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified

warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units

warrants become redeemable by us, we may not exercise our redemption right if the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise

warrants on a cashless basis. Third, if we call the public warrants for redemption, our management will have the option to require
all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In the event of an exercise on a cashless basis, a holder
would pay the warrant exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied
by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the &ldquo;fair market value&rdquo; (as defined in the next sentence)

the warrant agent or on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, as applicable. As a result, you would

stockholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration
to offset the negative impact on the market price of our Class A common stock that is expected when the securities owned by our
initial stockholders or holders of working capital loans or their respective permitted transferees are registered.</P>

combination with companies in the technology industry but may also pursue other business combination opportunities, except that
we are not, under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, permitted to effectuate our initial business combination
with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet selected or approached any
specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of
any particular target business&rsquo;s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects.
To the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations
with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record
of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development
stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business,
we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate
time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to
control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment
in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available,
in a business combination target. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following our initial business
combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such
reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors
of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities
laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable
material misstatement or material omission.</P>

our initial business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business&rsquo;s management
may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target&rsquo;s management,
therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should
the target&rsquo;s management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations
and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain
stockholders following the initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such stockholders
are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.</P>

2019, we effected a 1.1 for 1 stock dividend and a 1.109091 for 1 stock dividend, respectively, for each share of Class B common
stock outstanding, resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate of 8,768,750 founder shares. Because the underwriters of our initial
public offering did not exercise their over-allotment option in full, 18,750 of such shares were forfeited in September 2019. The
founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. Our sponsor and Cantor purchased an aggregate
of 810,000 placement units at a price of $10.00 per unit (657,500 placement units by our sponsor and 152,500 placement units by
Cantor), for an aggregate purchase price of $8,100,000. Each placement unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half
of one warrant. Each whole warrant is exercisable to purchase one whole share of common stock at $11.50 per share. These securities
will also be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. Holders of founder shares have agreed (A) to vote
any shares owned by them in favor of any proposed initial business combination and (B) not to redeem any founder shares in connection
with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination. In addition, we may obtain loans from our sponsor,
affiliates of our sponsor or an officer or director. The personal and financial interests of our officers and directors may influence
their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination, completing an initial business combination and influencing
the operation of the business following the initial business combination.</P>

so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests

50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient
for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction
that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target,
our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination
company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue
a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of Class A common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding
capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of
a substantial number of new shares of common stock, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than
a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority stockholders may
subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company&rsquo;s stock
than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control
of the target business. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess
the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.</P>

you purchase at least two units, you will not be able to receive or trade a whole warrant. This is different from other offerings
similar to ours whose units include one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established
the components of the units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of an initial business
combination since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for one half of the number of shares compared to units that
each contain a warrant to purchase one whole share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive merger partner for target businesses.
Nevertheless, this unit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if they included a warrant to purchase one whole share.</P>

disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements

securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The
JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply
to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended
transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private
companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new
or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging
growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible
because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.</P>

registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are
a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared

compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal

business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination
or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination,
in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such initial business combination. Subject to
compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial
business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available
to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our initial business combination,

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">In July 2017, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update (&ldquo;ASU&rdquo;) 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Distinguishing Liabilities from
Equity (Topic 480) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Part I. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round
Features; Part II. Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic
Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception. Part I of this update addresses the
complexity of accounting for certain financial instruments with down round features. Down round features are features of certain
equity-linked instruments (or embedded features) that result in the strike price being reduced on the basis of the pricing of
future equity offerings. Also, entities must adjust their basic Earnings per Share (&ldquo;EPS&rdquo;) calculation for the effect
of the down round provision when triggered (that is, when the exercise price of the related equity-linked financial instrument
is adjusted downward because of the down round feature). That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available
to common shareholders in basic EPS. An entity will also recognize the effect of the trigger within equity. The guidance is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted this guidance
during the period ended December 31, 2019. The adoption of this guidance enabled the Company to record the warrants as equity
instruments and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s financial position, results of operations, cash
flows or disclosures moving forward until a trigger event occurs. Part II of this update addresses the difficulty of navigating
Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, because of the existence of extensive pending content in the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification. This pending content is the result of the indefinite deferral of accounting requirements about mandatorily
redeemable financial instruments of certain nonpublic entities and certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests. The
amendments in Part II of this update are not expected to have an impact on the Company.</P>

we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. Following the consummation of our initial public offering, the net proceeds
of our initial public offering, including amounts in the trust account, have been invested in U.S. government treasury bills,

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">Disclosure controls are
procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under
the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the
SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive
officer and chief financial officer (our &ldquo;Certifying Officers&rdquo;), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2019, pursuant to Rule&nbsp;13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying
Officers concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: right">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">We do not expect that
our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures,
no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure
controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we
have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also
is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We have 4 directors. Our board of directors
is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except for those directors
appointed prior to our first annual meeting of stockholders) serving a three-year term. In accordance with NASDAQ corporate governance
requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing
on NASDAQ. The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Mr. Chao and Ms. Wells, will expire at our first
annual meeting of stockholders. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Mr. Bell, will expire at the
second annual meeting of stockholders. The term of office of the third class of directors, consisting of Mr. Koenig, will expire
at the third annual meeting of stockholders.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Our officers are appointed by the board
of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors
is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our bylaws provide that our officers
may consist of a Chairman of the Board, one or more Chief Executive Officers, Chief Financial Officer, President, Vice Presidents,
Secretary, Treasurer, Assistant Secretaries and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">NASDAQ listing standards require that a
majority of our board of directors be independent. An &ldquo;independent director&rdquo; is defined generally as a person other
than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion
of the company&rsquo;s board of directors, would interfere with the director&rsquo;s exercise of independent judgment in carrying
out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that Messrs. Chao and Bell and Ms. Wells are &ldquo;independent
directors&rdquo; as defined in the NASDAQ listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly
scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">None of our officers has received any cash
compensation for services rendered to us. Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of our
sponsor a total of $15,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of
our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. Other than as set forth elsewhere
in this prospectus, no compensation of any kind, including any finder&rsquo;s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in
respect of any payment of a loan, will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers, directors or advisors or any affiliate of our sponsor,
officers, directors or advisors, prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation
of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals will be reimbursed
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses
and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments
that were made to our sponsor, officers or directors, advisors or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial
business combination will be made using funds held outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such
payments, we do not expect to have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and
executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with identifying and consummating an initial business
combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">After the completion of our initial business
combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the
combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials
or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed initial business combination. We have
not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management.
It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed initial business combination, because
the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. Any compensation
to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation
committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors.</P>

although it is possible that some or all of our officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to
remain with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements
to retain their positions with us may influence our management&rsquo;s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business
but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination
will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements
with our officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment.</P>

In accordance with Rule 5605 of the NASDAQ rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for
selection by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out
the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee.
The directors who will participate in the consideration and recommendation of director nominees are Messrs. Chao and Bell and
Ms. Wells. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the NASDAQ rules, all such directors are independent. As there is no standing nominating
committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place.</P>

compensation for services rendered to us. We pay our sponsor a total of&thinsp;$15,000 per month for office space, utilities and

paying these monthly fees. No compensation of any kind, including any finder&rsquo;s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies

or officers, prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business
combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will be made using funds
held outside the trust account. Other than audit committee review of such payments, we do not expect to have any additional controls

not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management.
It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed initial business combination, because
the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. Any compensation
to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation

to retain their positions with us may influence our management&rsquo;s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business

In August and September 2019, we effected a 1.1 for 1 stock dividend and a 1.109091 for 1 stock dividend, respectively, for each
share of Class B common stock outstanding, resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate of 8,768,750 founder shares. The number
of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding
shares upon completion of this offering (excluding the placement units and underlying securities). Since the underwriters partially
exercised the over-allotment option, the sponsor forfeited 18,750 of its founder shares, which were canceled by the Company.</P>

costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our
officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination,
we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of
the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be
used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option
of the lender, upon consummation of our initial business combination. The units would be identical to the placement units. The
terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect
to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not
believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds
in our trust account.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">We have audited the accompanying balance
sheet of&nbsp;Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2019, and the related
statements of operations, changes in stockholders&rsquo; equity and cash flows, for the period from April 5, 2019 (inception)
to December&nbsp;31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of&nbsp;
December&nbsp;31, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from April 5, 2019 (inception) to
December&nbsp;31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on
our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have,
nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required
to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the entity's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">Our audit included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.</P>

Offering and the sale of Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally
toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination
successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at
least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest
earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company
will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting
securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register
as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.</FONT></P>

Company will provide its holders (the &ldquo;public stockholders&rdquo;) of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock included
in the public units (&ldquo;Public Shares&rdquo;) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon
the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination
or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination
or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem
their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account ($10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata
interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations).
The per-share amount to be distributed to public stockholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred
underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 6). There will be no redemption rights
upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company&rsquo;s warrants. The Company will proceed with a Business
Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon such consummation
of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of
the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote
for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the
&ldquo;Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation&rdquo;), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing
a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain
stockholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation
pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection
with a Business Combination, the Company&rsquo;s Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5), Placement
Shares (as defined in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving
a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether
they vote for or against the proposed transaction.</FONT></P>

Combination within in the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the
Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible

lesser of (i) $10.00 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of

the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce

requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to,
not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of

Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial
accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared
effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised
financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and
comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The
Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and
it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the
new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company&rsquo;s
financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which
has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting
standards used.</FONT></P>

(&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 480 &ldquo;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.&rdquo; Common stock subject to mandatory redemption
is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common
stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence
of uncertain events not solely within the Company&rsquo;s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common
stock is classified as stockholders&rsquo; equity. The Company&rsquo;s common stock features certain redemption rights that are
considered to be outside of the Company&rsquo;s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at
December 31, 2019, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders&rsquo;
equity section of the Company&rsquo;s balance sheet.</FONT></P>

Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, &ldquo;Income Taxes.&rdquo; Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred
tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.</FONT></P>

740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of
tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more
likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for
interest and penalties as of December 31, 2019. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result
in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by
major taxing authorities since inception.</FONT></P>

income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding

by dividing the interest income earned on the Trust Account of $1,809,163 (net of applicable franchise and income taxes of approximately
$613,000 for the period from April 5, 2019 (inception) through December 31, 2019), by the weighted average number of Class&nbsp;A
redeemable common stock since issuance of 35,000,000 shares. Net loss per common share, basic and diluted for Class A and Class&nbsp;B
non-redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing the net income (loss), less income attributable to Class&nbsp;A redeemable
common stock, by the weighted average number of Class A and Class&nbsp;B non-redeemable common stock outstanding for the period.
Class A and Class B non-redeemable common stock includes the Founder Shares and the Placement Units as these shares do not have
any redemption features and do not participate in the income earned on the Trust Account.</P>

assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts
become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and
tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of all of the information available, management believes
that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established
a full valuation allowance. For the period from April 5, 2019 (inception) through December 31, 2019, the change in the valuation
allowance was $61,973.</FONT></P>
