Item 1.  Business

Introduction

     Coeur d'Alene Mines  Corporation is engaged  through its  subsidiaries in
the operation and/or ownership, development and exploration of silver and gold
mining  properties and companies  located  primarily  within the United States
(Nevada,  Idaho and  Alaska) and South  America  (Bolivia  and  Chile).  Coeur
d'Alene Mines  Corporation and its  subsidiaries  are hereinafter  referred to
collectively as "Coeur" or the "Company."

Overview of Mining Properties and Interests

     The Company's most significant mining properties and interests are:

     o   The  Rochester  Mine is a silver and gold  surface  mining  operation
         located in  northwestern  Nevada and is 100%  owned and  operated  by
         Coeur. It is one of the largest and lowest cost of production primary
         silver mines in the United States.  During 1999, the Company acquired
         the mineral  rights to the Nevada  Packard  property which is located
         two miles south of the Rochester  mine. The Company is in the process
         of permitting the Nevada Packard property in order to commence mining
         activity;

     o   Coeur owns 100% of the capital stock of Coeur Silver Valley  ("Silver
         Valley"),  which owns and operates the Galena underground silver mine
         that  resumed  production  in May  1997,  and  also  owns  the  Coeur
         underground silver mine that discontinued operations on July 2, 1998.
         In addition, Silver Valley owns the Caladay property that adjoins the
         Galena  Mine,  and  has  operating  control  of  several   contiguous
         exploration properties in the Coeur d'Alene Silver Mining District of
         Idaho;

     o   The Fachinal Mine is an open pit and underground gold and silver mine
         which is  wholly-owned  and operated by Coeur and located in southern
         Chile, South America. The Company suspended operations at Fachinal in
         December  of 2000 in order  to fully  evaluate  and  develop  a newly
         discovered zone of high-grade gold and silver mineralization;

     o   The Petorca Mine is an  underground  and surface gold and silver mine
         which is wholly-owned and operated by Coeur and is located in central
         Chile, South America;

     o   The Company owns 100% of the  Kensington  Property,  located north of
         Juneau,  Alaska and is developing it as a proposed  underground  gold
         mine. An independently  prepared optimization study completed in late
         1998  estimated  cash  operating  costs of $190 per ounce of gold and
         estimated capital costs to develop the mine of $192 million;

                                     -3-

<PAGE>


     o   Coeur owns 100% of Empressa  Minera  Manquiri  S.A.  ("Manquiri"),  a
         Bolivian  company,  that  controls  the  mining  rights  for  the San
         Bartolome silver project,  which is a silver development  property in
         Bolivia; and

     Coeur also has  interests  in other  properties  which are the subject of
silver or gold  exploration  activities at which no mineable ore reserves have
yet been delineated.


Exploratory Mining Properties

     The Company either directly or through  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  owns,
leases  and has  interests  in  certain  exploration-stage  mining  properties
located in the United States,  Chile and Bolivia.  In keeping with its overall
efforts to focus its resources, the Company conducted approximately 70% of its
exploration  activities  during  2000 on or  near  existing  properties  where
infrastructure and production facilities are already in place.

     In addition to its exploration program around existing mines, the Company
also  controls  or has options to acquire a number of  early-stage  prospects,
including the Wonder silver property located in Nevada.

Significant Developments in 2000

     On March 15, 2000, each  outstanding  share of the Company's  outstanding
Mandatory Adjustable Redeemable Convertible Securities (MARCS) was mandatorily
converted  into 1.111 shares of common  stock.  The Company  issued a total of
approximately  7.9  million  shares of  common  stock in  connection  with the
mandatory conversion.

     In September  2000, the Company  signed an exploration  agreement with an
option to purchase the Wonder silver property located in northwestern  Nevada,
approximately 120 miles east of Reno. The Company commenced a drilling program
at the  property  in an effort  to  develop a new  source of  low-cost  silver
production.

     In November  2000,  the Company  announced the discovery of a new area of
gold and  silver  mineralization.  The  Cerro  Bayo  zone,  which  is  located
approximately  nine miles east of the Fachinal Mine's  processing  facilities,
has  significantly  higher grade ore than any material  previously  mined. The
Company  suspended  operations  at its  Fachinal  Mine in order to  complete a
detailed development plan for the new zone, which the Company believes has the
potential to significantly improve the economics of the Fachinal Mine.

     During 2000,  the Company  repurchased  a total of $31.7  million in face
value of its outstanding Convertible Subordinated  Debentures,  for a purchase
price of $14.1 million. As a result of these repurchases, the Company recorded
an extraordinary gain of $16.1 million net of tender offer expenses and taxes.

                                     -4-

<PAGE>


     Of the $31.7 million descried above, approximately $7.0 million principal
amount of its 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2002 were repurchased
pursuant  to a cash tender  offer that closed in June 2000.  The price paid by
the Company for the repurchased debentures was approximately $5.0 million plus
accrued and unpaid interest.  The Company  recorded an  extraordinary  gain of
approximately $1.1 million,  net of tender offer expenses,  as a result of the
repurchase.

     The balance of the  repurchases of Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures,
other than the  above-described  tender offer, were approximately $2.1 million
principal amount of 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures,  approximately $.6
million  principal amount of 6.375%  Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures and
approximately  $22.0  million  principal  amount  of  its  outstanding  7 1/4%
Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures  due 2005. The price paid by the Company
for these repurchases was  approximately  $9.1 million plus accrued and unpaid
interest. As a result of those additional repurchases, the Company recorded an
extraordinary gain of approximately $15.0 million.

     During 2000,  the Company  organized as a new,  wholly-owned  subsidiary,
Mine Depot Inc., the mission of which is to develop and market  internet-based
e-business  tools for mining  companies  and their  suppliers  of products and
services designed to create time and cost savings and make existing  processes
more efficient.

     During 2000,  the Company  organized as a new,  wholly-owned  subsidiary,
Earthworks  Technology Inc., the mission of which is to provide  environmental
services for all phases of the mining  operation  life cycle.  Services  would
include new project permitting and environmental impact statement development,
environmental audits, and reclamation and closure planning and implementation.

Significant Developments in Early 2001

     On January 11, 2001,  subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2000, the
Company  announced  that it received  notice from the New York Stock  Exchange
that the Company  had fallen  below the  continued  listing  requirement  that
either its total market  capitalization or its shareholders'  equity amount to
at least $50 million. On January 11, 2001, the Company submitted a plan to the
New York Stock Exchange  reflecting the Company's  belief that by May 27, 2002
(within 18 months of receipt of the Exchange's notice),  the Company can be in
compliance with that listing  requirement and qualify for continued listing on
the New  York  Stock  Exchange.  The  Company  believes  that the  plan,  when
implemented,  should  result in an  increase  in the  Company's  shareholders'
equity above the required $50 million minimum amount.

     Consistent  with the Company's  stated strategy to focus primarily on the
development  of its  silver  assets,  Coeur  initiated  a program  to sell its
non-core gold  holdings.  Consequently,  on February 7, 2001, the Company sold
its 50% shareholding in Gasgoyne Gold Mines NL ("Gasgoyne") for A$28.1 million
(US$15.6 million) in cash.  Gasgoyne owns 50% of the Yilgarn Star Mine located
in Western  Australia  and certain other  exploration  stage  properties.  The
purchaser  was Sons of Gwalia Ltd., an  Australian  corporation  who owned the

                                     -5-

<PAGE>


other 50% of Gasgoyne. As a result of the anticipated transaction, the Company
recorded at December  31, 2000 a writedown  of $12.2  million  reflecting  the
excess carrying value of the Gasgoyne shares over the sales price.

     On February 26, 2001, the Company  announced that it had formally engaged
a  financial  advisor to assist  with the sale of Coeur's  gold  interests  in
Chile.  These  interests  consist of the Fachinal and Petorca  mines,  various
exploration properties and other financial assets.

     On March 16, 2001,  representatives  of the United States and the Company
reached  an  agreement  in  principle  to  settle  the  lawsuit  filed  by the
Government in March 1996 in the U.S.  District Court for the District of Idaho
alleging  response costs and damages to federal natural resources in the Coeur
d'Alene  River Basin as a result of alleged  releases of hazardous  substances
from  prior  mining  activities  in  the  area.  The  terms  of  the  proposed
settlement,  which are subject to final Justice  Department and Court approval
and are  discussed  below  under  Item 3 ("Legal  Proceedings"),  provide  for
payments by the Company to the Government of approximately $3.9 million plus a
maximum of $3.0 million of future conditional net smelter royalty payments. As
a result,  the Company recorded an expense of  approximately  $4.2 million for
settlement of this lawsuit, including legal fees and other costs, in 2000.

     On March 19, 2001, the Company issued a total of 1,787,500  shares of its
Common Stock to two holders of a total of $5 million  principal  amount of the
Company's outstanding 7 1/4% Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures due 2005 in
exchange for such  Debentures.  The  Company's  financial  statements  for the
quarter  ending  March  31,  2001  will  record  an   extraordinary   gain  of
approximately  $3.0  million  representing  the  excess  of  the  extinguished
principal  amount of the  Debenture  liability  over the  value of the  shares
issued by the Company in exchange, net of offering costs and taxes.

Business Strategy

     The   Company's   business   strategy  is  to   capitalize   on  the  ore
reserve/mineralized  material  bases  located at its  operating  mines and the
expertise  of its  management  team  to  become  the  leading  primary  silver
production  company via long-term,  cash flow generating growth. The principal
elements of the Company's  business strategy are as follows:  (i) increase the
Company's  silver  production  and  reserves  in order to remain the  nation's
largest  primary silver  producer and one of the world's larger primary silver
producers;  (ii)  decrease  cash  costs and  increase  production  at  Coeur's
existing silver mining operations;  (iii) acquire operating mines, exploration
and/or  development  properties with a view to reducing the Company's cash and
total  costs,  provide  short-term  positive  cash flow  return and expand its
silver  production  base and  reserves;  and (iv)  continue to explore for new
silver discoveries primarily near its existing mine sites.

Sources of Revenue

     The Rochester Mine, Silver Valley,  Fachinal Mine, and Petorca Mine which
are operated by the Company,  and the  Company's  interest in the Yilgarn Star
Mine held by Gasgoyne,  constituted the Company's  principal sources of mining
revenues in 2000.  The following  table sets forth  information  regarding the
percentage  contribution to the Company's total revenues (i.e.,  revenues from
the sale of  concentrates  and dore plus other income) by the sources of those
revenues during the past five years:

(1) Increased ownership to 100% from 51% in September 1996.

(2)  Commenced  commercial   production  on  January  1,  1997  for  financial
     reporting purposes. Operations suspended on December 1, 2000.

(3)  The Company increased its ownership interest in Silver Valley from 50% to
     100% on  September  9, 1999.  The  Company's  interest  in Silver  Valley
     accounted for  approximately  3.0 % of total revenues for the approximate
     eight months  subsequent to its start-up in May 1996. The Company changed
     its  method  of  accounting  for  Silver  Valley  from the  proportionate
     consolidation  method to the equity  method of  accounting at the time of
     the acquisition.  On September 9, 1999, the Company commenced  accounting
     for Silver Valley on a fully consolidated basis.

(4)  The Company's  interest in Gasgoyne  accounted for approximately  1.2% of
     total  revenues  for  the  approximate  six  months   subsequent  to  its
     acquisition by the Company in May 1996. The reported  percentages reflect
     the fact that  Coeur's  interest in  Gasgoyne's  revenue was 35% from May
     1996 to February  1997, 36% from March 1997 to May 1997 and 50% after May
     1997. The Company's  interest in Gasgoyne is reported in accordance  with
     the equity method.

(5)  The  Company  discontinued  mining and milling  operations  at the Golden
     Cross Mine,  an  underground  and surface  gold mining  operation  in New
     Zealand,  in April 1998. The revenue  received in 1999 represents the net
     proceeds received from the settlement of the outstanding  litigation with
     Cyprus relating to the Golden Cross mine.


Definitions

The following sets forth definitions of certain important mining terms used in
this report.


"Cash  Costs"  are  costs  directly  related  to the  physical  activities  of
producing  silver and gold,  and include  mining,  processing  and other plant
costs,  deferred mining adjustments,  third-party refining and smelting costs,
marketing  expense,  on-site  general  and  administrative  costs,  royalties,
in-mine drilling  expenditures that are related to production and other direct
costs, but exclude depreciation, depletion and amortization, corporate general
and administrative expense, mineral exploration,  financing costs and accruals
for mine reclamation.

"Dore" is bullion  produced by smelting which contains gold,  silver and minor
amounts of impurities.

"Gold" is a metallic element with minimum fineness of 999 parts per 1000 parts
pure gold.

"Heap Leaching  Process" is a process of extracting gold and silver by placing
broken ore on an impermeable  pad and applying a dilute cyanide  solution that
dissolves a portion of the contained gold and silver, which are then recovered
in metallurgical processes.

"Noncash  costs" are costs that are  typically  accounted for ratably over the
life of an operation and include  depreciation,  depletion and amortization of
capital  assets,  accruals for the costs of final  reclamation  and  long-term
monitoring and care that are usually incurred at the end of mine life, and the
amortization  of the  economic  cost of  property  acquisitions,  but  exclude
amortization  of  deferred  tax  purchase  adjustments  relating  to  property
acquisitions  established in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes."

"Total production costs" are the sum of cash costs and noncash costs.

"Mineralized  Material"  is gold and  silver  bearing  material  that has been
physically  delineated  by  one or  more  of a  number  of  methods  including
drilling,  underground  work,  surface  trenching and other types of sampling.
This material has been found to contain a sufficient  amount of mineralization
of an  average  grade of metal  or  metals  to have  economic  potential  that
warrants further exploration evaluation.  While this material is not currently
or may never be classified as reserves, it is reported as mineralized material
only if the potential exists for reclassification  into the reserves category.
This  material  cannot be  classified  in the  reserves  category  until final
technical,  economic  and legal  factors  have been  determined.  Under United
States Securities and Exchange Commissions  standards,  a mineral deposit does
not qualify as a reserve unless the  recoveries  from the deposit are expected

                                     -8-

to be  sufficient  to recover  total cash and non-cash  costs for the mine and
related facilities.

"Ore Reserve" is the part of a mineral deposit which can be  economically  and
legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.

"Probable  Reserve" is a part of a mineralized  deposit which can be extracted
or produced economically and legally at the time of the reserve determination.
The quantity and grade and/or  quality of a probable  reserve is computed from
information  similar  to that  used for a proven  reserve,  but the  sites for
inspection,  sampling and  measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less
adequately  spaced.  The  degree of  assurance,  although  lower than that for
proven  reserves,  is high  enough  to  assume  continuity  between  points of
observation. Mining dilution has been factored into the estimation of probable
reserves.  The Company used  long-term  price  estimates of $5.50 per ounce of
silver and $300 per ounce of gold in estimating  probable reserves at December
31, 2000.

"Proven Reserves" are a portion of a mineral deposit which can be extracted or
produced  economically  and legally at the time of the reserve  determination.
The  quantity of a proven  reserve is  computed  from  dimensions  revealed in
outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed
from the results of detailed sampling and the sites for inspections,  sampling
and  measurement  are spaced so closely and the geologic  character is so well
defined that size,  shape,  depth and mineral  content of a proven  reserve is
well-established.  Mining  dilution has been factored  into the  estimation of
proven reserves. The Company used long-term price estimates of $5.50 per ounce
of silver and $300 per ounce of gold in estimating proven reserves at December
31, 2000.

"Run-of-mine   Ore"  is  mined  ore  which  has  not  been  subjected  to  any
pretreatment, such as washing, sorting or crushing prior to processing.

"Silver" is a metallic  element  with  minimum  fineness of 995 parts per 1000
parts pure silver.

"Stripping  Ratio" is the ratio of the number of tons of waste material to the
number of tons of ore extracted at an open-pit mine.

"Ton" means a short ton which is equivalent to 2,000 pounds,  unless otherwise
specified.

Silver and Gold Operations

North America

Rochester Mine

     The Rochester  Mine is a silver and gold surface mine located in Pershing
County,  Nevada,  approximately 25 road miles northeast of Lovelock.  The mine
commenced  operations in 1986.  The Company owns 100% of the Rochester Mine by
virtue of its 100% ownership of its subsidiary,  Coeur Rochester, Inc. ("Coeur
Rochester").   The  property  consists  of  16  patented  and  541  unpatented
contiguous mining claims and 54 mill-site claims totaling approximately 11,000
acres.

     Production at Rochester in 2000 was  approximately  6.7 million ounces of
silver  and  75,900  ounces of gold,  compared  to 6.2  ounces  of silver  and
approximately  70,400  ounces  of gold  in the  prior  year.  Cash  costs  per
equivalent ounce of silver  decreased to $3.90 per ounce in 2000,  compared to
$3.97  per  ounce in  1999.  Despite  mining  lower  grade  ore  during  2000,
production  increased and cash costs  decreased due to the  implementation  of
several operating  improvements  that included  increasing the capacity of the
conveyor  system and the crushing  circuit as well as increasing  the solution
flow on the leach pad by approximately 15%.

     The mine  utilizes the heap  leaching  process to extract both silver and
gold from ore mined using conventional open pit methods.  Approximately 45,760
tons of ore and waste per day were mined from the open pit in 2000 compared to
45,100 tons per day in 1999. The average strip ratio for the remaining life of
the mine will vary based primarily on future gold and silver prices.  However,
the average strip ratio is anticipated to be less than 1:1.

     Ore is  crushed  to  approximately  3/8 inch and is then  transported  by
conveyor and 85 and 150 ton trucks to leaching pads where  solution is applied
via drip  irrigation  to dissolve  the silver and gold  contained  in the ore.
Certain  low-grade ores are hauled  directly,  as run-of-mine,  by 85 ton haul
trucks to leaching  pads where  solution is applied to dissolve the silver and
gold contained in the ore. The solutions  containing the dissolved  silver and

                                     -10-

<PAGE>


gold are collected in a processing plant where the zinc  precipitation  method
is used to recover the silver and gold from solution.

     Based upon actual operating experience and certain metallurgical testing,
the Company  estimates  recovery rates of 59% for silver and 90% for gold. The
leach cycle at the Rochester Mine requires  approximately seven years from the
point ore is placed on the leach pad until all recoverable metal is recovered.
However, a significant proportion of metal recovery occurs in the early years.

     The first phase of a comprehensive in-pit and near-pit ore definition and
exploration program consisting of 114 reverse circulation drill holes totaling
more than 40,000 feet was completed in mid-2000.  A follow-up phase 2 drilling
program of 46 holes totaling 22,000 feet was completed by the end of the year.
The emphasis of the second phase of the drill program was on areas to the east
and south  outside of the ultimate  pit  boundary  and a selected  area to the
southwest  of the pit. As a result of the  exploration  and  in-fill  drilling
program at and near  Rochester  during 2000, the Company was able to virtually
replace  all gold and silver  reserves  mined  during  2000 and  significantly
increase  mineralized  material.  In addition,  the program also  extended the
limits of  potentially  economic  mineralization  well  beyond the current pit
boundary, especially to the east and south of the Rochester pit.


     Simultaneously   with  the  phase  2  exploration  program  at  and  near
Rochester,  drilling  also was  carried  out at the Nevada  Packard  satellite
deposit, located approximately one and one half miles to the south of the main
pit. At the Nevada  Packard  property,  which was  purchased by the Company in
August 1999, a total of 73 drill holes were completed  during 2000  comprising
almost 24,000 feet. The exploration  program increased the proven and probable
reserves  and  identified  two  new  zones  of  mineralization  which  will be
investigated  further  during  2001.  The  Company  expects  to  complete  the
permitting of Nevada Packard in 2001 and commence  construction of a haul road
connecting Nevada Packard to the Rochester processing  facilities.  This would
allow production to commence in 2002.

     The  Company's  capital   expenditures  at  the  Rochester  Mine  totaled
approximately  $2.2 million in 2000, of which  approximately  $1.0 million was
used to expand the stage II leach pad. The Company  plans  approximately  $1.6
million of capital  expenditures at the mine during 2001, most of which is for
Nevada Packard development.

     Asarco,  the prior lessee,  has a net smelter  royalty  interest which is
payable  only when the market  price of silver  equals or  exceeds  $19.01 per
ounce up to maximum rate of 5%.

Coeur Silver Valley ("Silver Valley")

     As previously  noted,  Coeur acquired 50% of Silver Valley from Asarco on
September 9, 1999,  thereby  increasing  its ownership  interest to 100%.  The
benefits identified by Coeur when it consummated that acquisition included (i)
an  increase  of  1.8  million  ounces  in  Coeur's  estimated  annual  silver
production,  (ii) the  addition  of 16.2  million  ounces of silver to Coeur's
proven  and  probable  reserves  and 6.0  million  ounces  to  Coeur's  silver
resources,  (iii) the  potential to further  increase  reserves and  resources
through systematic  exploration,  (iv) the potential to increase production at
the Galena Mine and reduce cash costs,  and (v) the  consolidation  of Coeur's
ownership position and control of Idaho's Silver Valley.

     Silver  Valley owns the Coeur and Galena  Mines and the Caladay  property
situated in the Coeur d'Alene Mining District of Idaho.  Effective  January 1,
1995,  Coeur,  Callahan  Mining  Corporation   ("Callahan"),   a  wholly-owned
subsidiary of Coeur, and Asarco  transferred  their interests in the Coeur and
Galena Mines and Caladay property to Silver Valley, an entity created for that
sole purpose. As a result, Coeur and Asarco owned 50% of Silver Valley. During

                                     -12-

<PAGE>


1995, Silver Valley conducted a planned  underground  development program that
increased  ore  reserves at the Galena  Mine.  As a result of this program and
increased  silver  prices,  a decision  was made on February 8, 1996 by Silver
Valley to reopen the mines.

     Silver  Valley  recommenced  operations  at the Coeur mine portion of its
property in June 1996 and continued  mining  existing  reserves  there through
July 2, 1998,  when  operations  were  terminated  after known reserves at the
Coeur mine were depleted.  Silver Valley resumed production at the Galena Mine
in May 1997 and operations continue.

     Silver Valley plans to continue exploratory and developmental  activities
at the  Coeur,  Galena  and  Caladay  Mines as well as at  several  contiguous
properties  in the  Coeur  d'Alene  Mining  District  with a view  toward  the
development of new silver reserves and resources.

     Galena Mine

     The  Galena  Mine  property  is located  immediately  west of the City of
Wallace in Shoshone  County in northern  Idaho.  The  property  consists of 52
patented mining claims and 25 unpatented mining claims totalling approximately
1,100 acres.

     Coeur's  production in 2000 was 4.0 million ounces of silver, an increase
of 82% as compared  to 2.2 million  ounces in 1999.  The  Company's  increased
ownership  in  September  1999  accounts  for the  majority of the increase in
production.  However,  the 4.0 million ounces of silver produced in 2000 was a
new record for Coeur Silver  Valley and resulted from improved ore grades from
the  more  productive  vein  structures  at  depth  and an  increase  in  mill
throughput.  Consequently,  total cash costs in 2000  declined by 10% to $4.59
per ounce of  silver as  compared  to $5.09 per ounce in the  preceding  year.
Furthermore,  the rapid pace of underground  development has provided  greater
access to the wider, higher-grade vein systems.

     The Galena Mine is an underground silver-copper mine and is served by two
vertical shafts.  The No. 3 shaft is the primary production shaft and is 5,800
feet deep.  The Galena  shaft  primarily  provides  utility  access for water,
electrical power and sand backfill for underground operations.

     The mine  utilizes the drift and fill mining method with sand backfill to
extract ore from the high grade  silver-copper  vein deposits that  constitute
the  majority  of the ore  reserves.  Silver  and copper  are  recovered  by a
flotation  mill  that  produces  a silver  rich  concentrate  which is sold to
third-party smelters in the United States and Canada.  Silver recovery through
the mill averaged 96% in 2000, consistent with 1999.

     Waste  material from the milling  process is deposited in a tailings pond
located  approximately two miles from the minesite.  The tailings  containment
pond  has  capacity  for  approximately   nine  additional  years  at  current
production rates.

     The initial phase of an aggressive  exploration  program conducted during
2000 was successful.  Diamond  drilling  intersected an 11-foot section of the

                                     -13-

<PAGE>


294 vein in the West Argentine area of the property that graded 23.9 ounces of
silver per ton and 1.4% copper.  This ore grade  intercept was encountered 280
feet west of any previously known mineralization.  In addition,  the same hole
intercepted a second  mineralized  zone contained  within the Polaris fault of
20.6 feet grading 6.6 ounces of silver per ton and 1.1% copper  including  5.9
feet at a grade of 10.4 ounces of silver per ton and 2.2% copper.  This second
zone likely represents a new discovery within the Polaris fault and is similar
in many respects to the high-grade 72 vein that is currently one of the mine's
most  productive  sources  of  silver  ore.  More  significantly,  the  second
intersection is over 2,000 feet west of the current development of the 72 vein
and  confirms  Coeur's  belief  that many  areas of the  property  outside  of
existing mining operations have excellent potential for the development of new
reserves and resources.

     Total  capital  expenditures  by Silver Valley at the Galena Mine in 2000
were $6.4 million of which $5.4 million was for mine  development.  Coeur made
this  significant  investment  in  capital  at the  Galena  mine  as part of a
long-term strategy to increase annual production to 5.0 million ounces.

     Silver Valley has planned for capital  expenditures of approximately $2.9
million for the Galena Mine during 2001. Mine  development  will again account
for the majority of this expenditure. Also included in 2001's capital plan are
funds  necessary  to convert from  conventional  mining to  mechanized  mining
methods on a limited basis. This change should result in increased  production
and decreased cash costs and is a significant step towards  achieving  Coeur's
target 5.0 million ounces of silver per year.

     Coeur Mine

                                     -15-

<PAGE>


     The Coeur Mine is an  underground  silver  mine  located  adjacent to the
Galena Mine in the Coeur  d'Alene  Mining  District in Idaho,  and consists of
approximately  868 acres  comprised  of 38  patented  mining  claims  and four
unpatented mining claims.


     Operations at the Coeur Mine were  suspended on April 3, 1991 due to then
prevailing  silver  prices  and  placed  on a care  and  maintenance  basis to
conserve ore reserves.  Silver  Valley  resumed  production  activities at the
Coeur Mine in June 1996 and terminated  operations there on July 2, 1998 after
known reserves were depleted.

     There was no mining  activity at the Coeur Mine in 2000 and the  property
remained  on  care  and  maintenance.   However,  the  Company  believes  that
significant  potential  exists to discover  additional high grade silver veins
beneath the current limit of the underground workings.

     Caladay Property

     The Caladay property adjoins the Galena Mine. Prior to its acquisition by
the Company in 1991,  approximately $32.5 million was expended on the property
to  construct  surface  facilities,  a 5,101 ft.  deep  shaft  and  associated
underground  workings  to  explore  the  property.  Based on  Silver  Valley's
analysis of existing Galena Mine underground  workings and drilling results on
the Galena Property,  the Company  believes that similar  geologic  conditions
which exist at the Galena may extend into the Caladay property below the level
of the current Caladay workings. In addition,  the Caladay facilities are used
to benefit the Galena Mine operations, by exhausting ventilation.

South America - Chile

     On February 26, 2001, the Company  announced that it had formally engaged
Macquarie  North  American as a  financial  advisor to assist with the sale of
Coeur's gold  holdings in Chile.  These  holdings  consist of the Fachinal and
Petorca mines, exploration properties and other financial assets.

Fachinal Mine

     In  January  1990,  the  Company   acquired   through  its   wholly-owned
subsidiary, CDE Chilean Mining Corporation, ownership of the Fachinal gold and
silver property.  The Company  completed the construction of the Fachinal Mine
in October 1995 when initial mining operations started.  Commercial production
for financial accounting purposes commenced on January 1, 1997.

     The Fachinal  property  covers about 90 square miles and is located south
of Coihaique, the capital of Region XI in southern Chile, and approximately 10
miles west of the town of Chile  Chico.  The project  lies on the east side of
the Andes mountain range at an elevation ranging from 600 to 4,500 feet and is
serviced by a gravel road from Chile Chico. The Fachinal  property is known to
include multiple  epithermal veins containing gold and silver. The Company has

                                     -16-

been granted exploitation concessions (the Chilean equivalent to an unpatented
claim  except that the owner does not have title to the surface  which must be
separately  acquired from the surface owner) covering the mineralized areas of
the  Fachinal  property  as well as the  necessary  surface  rights  to permit
mining.

     Mining at Fachinal  occurs both on the surface and  underground.  Surface
mining is by the open pit and slot cut  methods  while  underground  mining is
done by the raise mining and shrinkage methods. During 2000, approximately 25%
of Fachinal's  ore was derived from  underground  mining and 32% from open pit
areas and 43% from the slot-cut areas.

     Ore is  processed  on site by a mill  which uses the  standard  flotation
process to produce a high grade gold and silver  concentrate.  The concentrate
is sold to  third-party  smelters,  primarily in Japan.  The mill has a design
capacity of 1,650 tons per day.  The  Company  estimates,  based on  operating
experience,  recovery  rates of 87% for gold  and 88% for  silver.  Electrical
power is generated  on-site by diesel generators and process water is obtained
from a  combination  of the adjacent  General  Carrera Lake and from  tailings
re-circulation.

     Silver and Gold production at Fachinal during 2000 was  approximately 0.9
million  ounces of silver and 16,000  ounces of gold,  compared to 1.1 million
ounces of silver and 25,500  ounces of gold in 1999.  Total cash costs in 2000
increased  to $447  per  gold  equivalent  ounce  compared  to $304  per  gold
equivalent ounce in 1999. The shortfall in production and the increase in cash
costs were due to lower ore grades and a  reduction  in tons milled and due to
severe winter  conditions  throughout  most of southern Chile that  restricted
development  and access to the most  productive  areas of the mine for several
months.

     During the latter half of 2000,  the Company  aggressively  continued its
exploration  program at Fachinal.  These efforts  resulted in the discovery of
the new Cerro  Bayo  zone  approximately  nine  miles  east of the  processing
facilities.  This zone  includes  a vein  structure  named  Lucero  that has a
greater strike length, width and grade than anything previously encountered in
the  district.  The Cerro Bayo zone,  which  consists  of  multiple  veins and
veinlettes  is  characterized  by a surface  expression of at least 8,200 feet
along strike and is up to 3,300 feet in width.  Today, the Lucero vein appears
to be the primary ore chute within this zone and has been traced for more than
2,600 feet along  strike and to  approximately  250 feet at depth.  The Lucero
vein is open in all directions and contains sections that are characterized by
high-grade gold and silver mineralization.  During the fourth quarter of 2000,
the Company suspended operations at Fachinal while it continued its evaluation
of the new zone and formulates detailed development and mining plans.

     Based on extensive  drilling,  channel sampling,  resource evaluation and
engineering  analysis  completed  during  2000 and  January  2001,  proven and
probable  reserves of 208,000 gold  equivalent  ounces have been delineated to
date. In addition, mineralized material of 585,000 tons with average grades of
0.08  ounces  of gold per ton and 5.0  ounces  of  silver  per ton  have  been
identified in the Cerro Bayo zone.

     During 1999,  the Company  exercised  its option to purchase  100% of the
Furioso  property  located  approximately  50 miles  southwest of the Fachinal
mine.  The  high-grade  Furioso ores will be  processed at the Fachinal  mill.
Estimated  cash costs at Furioso are $120 per gold  equivalent  ounce.  During
2000, the Company completed its 11-mile portion of a new road to allow haulage
of Furioso ore to  Fachinal  at a cost of $1.8  million.  The  government  has
committed to, and is currently working to complete,  the balance of the access
road.  Production from Furioso is expected to start when the development plans
for  Cerro  Bayo  are  completed  and  Coeur  makes  a  decision  to  re-start
operations.

     Total  capital  expenditures  at the  Fachinal  Mine in 2000,  were  $2.6
million,  primarily  for Furioso road  development.  The Company plans minimal
capital expenditures at Fachinal in 2001.

     During the first two years of commercial production (i.e. 1997 and 1998),
the  Fachinal  Mine  experienced  ore  reserve  complications  and  operations
problems that resulted in significantly  higher than expected cash costs. As a
result,  at December 31, 1998, the Company  reviewed the carrying value of the
Fachinal  Mine  and  recorded  an  impairment  write-down  of  $42.9  million,
reflecting  its  expectation  that it would not  recover the full value of its
remaining investment.

     Although  the  government  and economy of Chile has been stable in recent
years, the ownership of property in a foreign country is always subject to the
risk of expropriation or  nationalization  with inadequate  compensation.  Any
foreign  operation or  investment  may also be adversely  affected by exchange
controls,  currency fluctuations,  taxation and laws or policies of particular
countries as well as laws and policies of the United States affecting  foreign
trade, investment and taxation.

Petorca Mine

     Coeur owns 100% of the Petorca Mine located on approximately 34,000 acres
in the western  Andean  foothills  approximately  90 miles north of  Santiago,
Chile.  In July 1994, the Company  acquired an interest in Compania Minera CDE
El Bronce, a Chilean corporation ("CDE El Bronce") that owned the producing El
Bronce Mine,  now known as the Petorca  Mine. In September  1996,  the Company
increased its ownership interest of CDE El Bronce to 100%.

     The property  consists of 64 exploitation  concessions and 10 exploration
concessions. Surface rights to permit mining on the property have been granted
by the  private  owners.  Ore is  produced  from a complex  system of precious
metals bearing, epithermal, quartz-veins hosted in Cretaceous volcanic rocks.

     Petorca is primarily an underground  gold mine which is serviced by adits
at different  levels and  underground  ramps.  The mine uses trackless cut and
fill sublevel  caving with uncemented  backfill and shrinkage  mining methods.
Ore is hauled to the mill in 20-ton  trucks.  During 2000,  the Company  began
developing by surface  mining methods the satellite San Lorenzo  deposit.  San

                                     -19-

<PAGE>


Lorenzo is  primarily a copper  deposit  with lower  grade gold.  Ore from San
Lorenzo is processed at the main Petorca milling facilities.

     The processing  plant has two grinding  circuits with a total capacity of
900 tons per day but has  been  operating  on a  reduced  schedule  due to ore
availability.  Approximately  35% of the total gold  produced is  recovered by
gravity  methods  to produce a gold dore.  The  remaining  gold and silver are
recovered  by  traditional   flotation  methods  which  produce  a  high-grade
concentrate  which is sold to third-party  smelters,  primarily in Japan.  The
Company estimates,  based on operating  experience,  average recovery rates of
91% for gold and 84% for silver.

     Electrical power is purchased from a local  distributor that is connected
to the main Chilean power grid. Process water is pumped from the Petorca river
and  in  part  recovered  from  a  re-circulating  system  from  the  tailings
impoundment area.

     Gold  production  at Petorca in 2000 was 26,891 ounces of gold and 57,854
ounces of silver compared to 29,382 ounces of gold and 63,952 ounces of silver
in 1999.  Total cash costs per equivalent  ounce of gold in 2000 were $345 per
ounce  compared to $271 per ounce in 1999.  The decrease in production in 2000
and  corresponding  increase in cash costs was primarily  attributable  to the
mining of lower-grade  ore,  partially  offset by increased  mill  throughput.
Operations  also  were  adversely   affected  by  the  severe  winter  weather
conditions.  In addition, an accident severely restricted access to high-grade
areas of the mine during the first  quarter of 2000.  During the third quarter
of 2000, mining commenced at the San Lorenzo  copper-gold  satellite  deposit.
Waste removal progressed for much of the fourth quarter of 2000 in preparation
for ore  extraction,  which is  scheduled  to commence  in 2001.  Ore from San
Lorenzo will supplement the primary  underground ore supply and allow the mill
to operate closer to its design capacity.

     Capital  expenditures at Petorca in 2000 were $.7 million,  primarily for
mine development. Similar levels of capital spending are anticipated for 2001.

     Due to continued  operating losses incurred at the mine and a significant
decline in the price of gold, the Company recorded a $54.5 million  impairment
write-down in the first quarter of 1998.

     Coeur has an  obligation to pay the prior owner of CDE El Bronce a 3% net
smelter return royalty, payable quarterly, which commenced on January 1, 1997.
From July 1998 to December  2000, the prior owner agreed to a 2.4% net smelter
return royalty.

Australia

     Consistent with its strategy to focus  primarily on the Company's  silver
assets, Coeur sold its shareholding in Gasgoyne on February 7, 2001 for A$28.1
million (US$15.6 million).

     As a consequence  of the sale by Coeur of its  shareholding  in Gasgoyne,
which was effective  December 31, 2000,  the Company  recorded a write-down to
mining  properties of $12.2  million in the fourth  quarter of 2000 to reflect
the excess book value of the Gasgoyne shares above sale proceeds.

Gasgoyne Gold Mines NL ("Gasgoyne")- Yilgarn Star Mine

     In May 1996, Coeur acquired  approximately 35% of the outstanding  shares
of capital stock of Gasgoyne,  an Australian gold mining company,  in exchange
for a total of  1,419,832  shares  of Coeur  common  stock  and cash  totaling
approximately  $15.4 million. In May 1997, Coeur acquired an additional 14% of
the  outstanding  shares of Gasgoyne for $14.9  million,  as a result of which
Coeur's ownership  interest in Gasgoyne  increased to 50%. Coeur's interest in
Gasgoyne was being  accounted for using the equity  method.  The remaining 50%
interest in Gasgoyne is held by Sons of Gwalia Ltd., an Australian corporation
headquartered in Perth, Western Australia.

     Gasgoyne is engaged in the exploration, development and ownership of gold
properties  located in Western  Australia.  Gasgoyne's  principal asset is its
interest  in  the  Yilgarn  Star  Mine  in the  Marvel  Loch  region,  located
approximately  220 miles east of Perth. The Yilgarn Star Mine is operated as a
Joint Venture with Sons of Gwalia Ltd.  Sons of Gwalia  operates and has a 45%
interest  in the  Yilgarn  Star  mine and  Gasgoyne  has a 50%  interest;  the
remaining  interest is held by a private party.  As a result of its holding in
Gasgoyne, the Company had a 25% indirect interest in the Yilgarn Star Mine.

     Coeur's 25% share of  production  from the  Yilgarn  Star Mine was 26,000
ounces  of gold in  2000,  compared  to  26,400  ounces  in 1999.  Cash  costs
decreased from $287 per ounce in 1999 to $227 per ounce in 2000. The reduction
in cash costs was  achieved in spite of the  scheduled  mining of  lower-grade
ore.  Operating  improvements  implemented in 1999 to the crushing circuit and
change in the mining method,  plus a weaker Australia  dollar,  contributed to
the decline in cash costs in 2000.

     During  the  fourth   quarter  of  1999,   the  Company   evaluated   the
recoverability  of its  investment in the Yilgarn Star mine.  Using a $325 per
ounce gold price and based on  undiscounted  future cash flows,  in accordance
with the  standards  set forth in SFAS 121,  the Company  determined  that its
investment  in  property,  plant and  equipment  at the  Yilgarn  Star mine in
Australia  was  impaired.  The  total  amount  of  the  impairment,  based  on
discounted cash flows was $16.2 million at December 31, 1999, and was recorded

Development Properties

Kensington Gold Project

     On July 7,  1995,  Coeur,  through  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Coeur
Alaska, Inc. ("Coeur Alaska"), acquired the 50% ownership interest of Echo Bay
Exploration  Inc.  ("Echo Bay") in the  Kensington  property from Echo Bay and
Echo  Bay  Alaska,  Inc.  (collectively  the  "Sellers"),  giving  Coeur  100%
ownership of the Kensington property. The property is located on the east side
of  Lynn  Canal  between  Juneau  and  Haines,  Alaska.  As a  result  of that
transaction,  Coeur  assumed  full  ownership  and  operating  control  of the
project.  Pursuant to the Venture  Termination  and Asset  Purchase  Agreement
among Coeur  Alaska and the Sellers,  dated as of June 30, 1995,  Coeur Alaska
paid to the Sellers a total of $32.5 million and, pursuant to the Royalty Deed
set  forth  as an  exhibit  to the  Venture  Termination  and  Asset  Purchase
Agreement,  Coeur  Alaska  agreed to pay Echo Bay a scaled net smelter  return
royalty on 1 million  ounces of future  gold  production  after  Coeur  Alaska
recoups the $32.5 million  purchase  price and its  construction  expenditures
incurred  after July 7, 1995 in  connection  with  placing the  property  into
commercial  production.  The  royalty  ranges from 1% at $400 gold prices to a
maximum of 2 1/2% at gold prices above $475,  with the royalty to be capped at
1  million  ounces  of  production.   The  Kensington   project   consists  of
approximately  6,000  acres,  of which  approximately  750 acres are  patented
claims.  The  Kensington  ore deposit  consists of multiple,  precious  metals
bearing,  mesothermal,  quartz,  carbonate,  pyrite vein  swarms and  discrete
quartz-pyrite  veins  hosted  in  the  Cretaceous  age  Jualin  diorite.   The
gold-telluride-mineral    calaverite   is    associated    with   the   pyrite
mineralization.  The  following  proven and  probable  ore reserve  table (see

(1)       The proven  and  probable  reserves  estimate  is  derived  from the
          original 1998 Bechtel feasibility study, adjusted for a revised mine
          plan and updated capital and operating cost estimates.

     Not all  Kensington  ore zones  have been fully  delineated  at depth and
several  peripheral  zones  and  veins  remain  to be  explored.  The  Company
possesses the right to develop the Jualin  property,  an exploratory  property
located adjacent to the Kensington  Property.  The Jualin property consists of
approximately  9,400  acres,  of which  approximately  345 acres are  patented
claims.  The Company's rights to develop the Jualin property are subject to an
agreement which must be renewed in May 2008.

     During 1999 and 2000, the Company's efforts at Kensington continued to be
directed  toward the  permitting  process  and  further  project  optimization
studies.  In  December  1998,  the Company  announced  the  completion  of the
independent  optimization  study which contained a new mine plan that requires
extensive permit  modifications  due to the significant  change to the planned
method of tailings  disposal.  Based on the results of the optimization  study
the Company estimated that the project's cash operating costs could be reduced
to approximately $190 per ounce of gold and total capital costs to develop the
mine should be reduced to approximately $192 million.

     While not yet fully complete,  continued project optimization during 2000
has indicated  that the capital cost to develop the property  could be further
reduced.  Those  optimization  efforts  included:  1) a proposed  reduction in
process throughput combined with a corresponding  increase to the grade of ore
to be mined,  2) a relocation of the plant site, 3) a change to the method and
routing  of  personnel  and  supplies   transportation,   and  4)  a  possible
alternative  tailings  management system. The Company will continue to examine
these new alternatives given the potential capital cost savings.

     Total  expenditures  by the Company at the Kensington  property were $3.1
million, of which $1.6 million was capitalized in 2000. Such expenditures were
used to continue the permitting and optimization activities. The Company plans
approximately  $2.0 million in project  expenditures  during  2001,  which are
planned for technical  support,  engineering  studies required to complete the
modified permitting activities and site maintenance.

     During 1998, the Company recorded a $121.5 million write-down  reflecting
the use of a $350 per  ounce  gold  price  assumption,  pursuant  to SFAS 121.
Impairment  reviews were  performed in 2000 and 1999 using  long-term  average
gold price assumptions of $314 per ounce and $325 per ounce, respectively.  No
further write-downs were required as a result of these reviews.

     Coeur remains committed to completing the permitting process. However, no
assurance can be given as to whether or when the required regulatory approvals
will be  obtained  or as to whether  the  Company  will  place the  Kensington
project into commercial production.

The San Bartolome Project

     Coeur  acquired  100% of the  equity  in  Empressa  Miner  Manquiri  S.A.
("Manquiri") from Asarco on September 9, 1999.  Manquiri's  principal asset is
the mining rights in the San Bartolome project, a silver development  property
located  near the city of Potosi,  Bolivia,  on the flanks of Cerro Rico which
has been a world class silver  producing  district for many centuries,  having
produced in excess of 1.0 billion ounces of silver.  The San Bartolome project
consists of six distinct  silver-bearing  gravel  deposits,  which are locally
referred to as pallaco or sucu  deposits.  These  deposits lend  themselves to
simple,  free digging surface mining techniques which can be extracted without
drilling and blasting.  The deposits were formed as a result of erosion of the
silicified silver-rich upper part of the Cerro Rico mountain.

     The  mineral  rights  for the San  Bartolome  project  are  held  through
long-term lease agreements with several  independent  mining  cooperatives and
the Bolivian State Mining Company,  COMIBOL.  At present, 67 square kilometers
of  concessions  (16,600  acres) are  controlled  by  Manquiri.  The  JV/lease
agreements  are subject to a 4% production  royalty  payable  partially to the
Cooperatives and COMIBOL. During the current exploration stage, the properties
are subject to monthly payments totaling approximately US $25,500.

     Of the six pallacos  deposits  which are controlled by Coeur and surround
Cerro  Rico,  three are of  primary  importance  and are known as  Huachajchi,
Diablo  (consisting  of Diablo  Norte,  Diablo Sur and Diablo  Este) and Santa
Rita.  During 2000,  the Company  completed an intensive  field  program which
culminated in the  completion of a  pre-feasibility  study.  The field program
included   detailed   exploration,   bulk   sampling,   definition   drilling,
metallurgical  studies  and  environmental  baseline  data  collection.  Coeur
retained a third party geological  consulting firm to incorporate the new data
from the field program in an updated resource  estimate.  As a result, the San
Bartolome  resource  increased 15%, to 41.1 million tons with an average grade
of 2.98 ounces of silver per ton or 122 million  ounces of  contained  silver.
Approximately 93% of the new resource is classified as measured and indicated.

     To assist with the  pre-feasibility  study,  which was  completed  during
2000, Coeur retained third party  engineering and geological  consulting firms
to  examine  and verify all data used in the  study,  including  the  resource
estimation, process flow sheet design, site plan layout and detailed estimates
of all operating and capital costs.  The study  incorporates a cyanide milling
flow sheet with a wet pre-concentration screen circuit.

     The study  concludes  that a 7,000 to 7,500 ton per day mining  operation
could  be  constructed  at an  estimated  capital  cost of $60 to $70  million
(inclusive  of  working  capital,  owner's  costs and taxes and  duties).  The
operation would be capable of producing, on average, 5.5 to 6.0 million ounces
of  silver  per year at an  estimated  cash  cost of $3.50  per  ounce  over a
projected mine life in excess of eight years.

     The  Company is  continuing  with an  optimization  program  designed  to
further  increase   resources,   enhance   recoveries  and  examine  equipment

                                     -25-

alternatives.  When complete and depending on the price of silver, the Company
will make a decision on proceeding to a full scale feasibility study.

     Coeur spent  approximately  $2.7 million  progressing  the San  Bartolome
project during 2000 and plans  approximately  $2.9 million of exploration  and
project development expenditures during 2001.

     The San Bartolome  project involves risks that are inherent in any mining
venture,  as well as  particular  risks  associated  with the  location of the
project. The resource estimates indicated by the geologic studies performed to
date are  preliminary  in  nature  and may  differ  materially  after  further
development  and  metallurgical  testing is completed.  Also,  managing mining
projects  in the  altiplano  area of  Bolivia,  where  Cerro Rico is  located,
presents logistical  challenges.  The political and cultural  differences of a
foreign country may also present challenges.

Silver and Gold Prices

     The Company's  operating  results are  substantially  dependent  upon the
world market prices of silver and gold. The Company has no control over silver
and gold prices,  which can fluctuate widely. The volatility of such prices is
illustrated by the following  table,  which sets forth the high and low prices
of silver (as  reported by Handy and Harman) and gold (London  Metal  Exchange
final quotation) per ounce during the periods indicated:

Marketing

     Coeur has  historically  sold the gold and  silver  from its  mines  both
pursuant to forward  contracts  and at spot prices  prevailing  at the time of
sale.  Entering into forward sale contracts is a strategy which can be used to
enhance revenues and/or mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuating
precious  metals  prices.  The Company  continually  evaluates  the  potential
benefits of  engaging in these  strategies  based on the then  current  market
conditions. Coeur had no future silver production hedged at December 31, 2000.
In order to ensure  certain  minimum  cash  flows and reduce the impact of any
declines in gold prices, however, the Company has established the prices to be
received in the future for a portion of its gold production by entering into a
combination of forward sales agreements and put and call options.  At December
31, 2000,  approximately  15% of the Company's  estimated annual production of
gold over the next two years was committed  under the  Company's  gold hedging
program.

Exploration Activity

     Coeur,  either directly or through its wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  owns,
leases  and has  interests  in  certain  exploration-stage  mining  properties
located in the United States,  Chile and Bolivia.  Exploration and development
expenses of  approximately  $8.5 million and $9.4 million were incurred by the
Company in connection with exploration and development  activities in 1999 and
2000, respectively.

     In keeping with the  Company's  overall  efforts to focus its  resources,
Coeur  conducted  more  than 70% of the 2000  exploration  program  on or near
existing properties where infrastructure and production facilities are already
in place. The Company will continue this exploration focus in 2001.

     In addition to its exploration program around existing mines, the Company
also controls a number of early-stage  prospects,  the most promising of which
is the Wonder silver property located in Nevada. The property package consists
of 70 patented lode claims and a 123-acre  townsite.  Coeur acquired an option
to explore and purchase the property in September of 2000.

     The Wonder mine, located on the property,  was a historic silver and gold
producer  where 6.7  million  ounces of silver and 72,000  ounces of gold were
mined underground prior to the start of the Second World War.

     Coeur is  evaluating  the  potential to discover and develop bulk tonnage
deposits  adjacent to the known  steeply  dipping high grade vein systems that
have been identified on the property.

     During  the fourth  quarter  of 2000,  the  Company  conducted  a limited
reverse  circulation  drill program on the property,  testing the most obvious
targets.  In  addition,  Coeur  is  still  in  the  process  of  conducting  a
property-wide surface reconnaissance program, which will continue in 2001.

     Coeur's near mine  exploration  program in 2000 was devoted mainly to the
discovery  and   development   of  new  reserves  and  resources  at  existing
operations,  particularly  at  Fachinal,  Rochester  and Silver  Valley.  This
program  resulted  in the major new  discovery  of the Cerro  Bayo  deposit at
Fachinal.

     Considerable  progress was also made at Silver Valley and Rochester.  The
program at Silver Valley  significantly  extended some of the most  productive
veins at depth and identified a number of promising  exploration targets to be
tested in 2001, especially in the West Argentine area of the mine.

     At Rochester,  a major  reverse  circulation  drilling  program added new
reserves and resources and also  extended the limits of  potentially  economic
mineralization  well beyond the current pit  boundary,  especially to the east
and south of the Rochester pit. In addition,  mineralization was extended both
laterally  and at depth  at the  Nevada  Packard  satellite  deposit.  Two new

                                     -27-

<PAGE>


mineralized zones, called the east and west zones, were also discovered during
the year.

Provisions of the Transaction Agreement and Shareholder Agreement with Asarco

     As discussed  above,  Coeur  consummated an acquisition of certain silver
assets and  properties  from Asarco on September 9, 1999 in exchange for 7.125
million shares of Coeur Common Stock.  Pursuant to the  Transaction  Agreement
between  Coeur and Asarco,  dated May 13, 1999 and amended and  restated as of
June 22, 1999,  and which was approved by the  Company's  stockholders  at the
Annual  Meeting on  September  8,  1999,  Asarco  must,  during the five years
following  the  acquisition,  obtain the  consent of Coeur to any sale of such
shares,  and  Asarco may not sell any of such  shares to anyone  other than an
affiliate of Asarco or in a widely  distributed  public offering.  Pursuant to
the Shareholder  Agreement,  dated as of September 9, 1999,  between Coeur and
Asarco (the  "Shareholder  Agreement"),  Asarco has the right to nominate  two
directors for election to the Coeur Board of Directors.  If Asarco voluntarily
sells or  transfers  its shares of Coeur Common Stock to any person other than
an affiliate  and, as a result,  its  ownership is reduced to less than 10% of
Coeur's  Outstanding Common Stock, Asarco will have the right to nominate only
one director,  which right will continue so long as Asarco owns at least 1% of
Coeur's  outstanding  Common Stock.  Under the Shareholder  Agreement,  Asarco
further agreed that without the consent of Coeur's Board of Directors,  Asarco
will not acquire  Common Stock or other  voting  securities  of Coeur,  or any
rights  or  options  to  buy  any  of  such  securities,  if  after  any  such
acquisition,  Asarco  would own more than 20% of the total voting power of all
outstanding voting equities  securities of Coeur. Asarco has certain rights to
request  Coeur to register  Asarco's  shares of Coeur  Common  Stock under the
Securities Act of 1933.

     The Shareholder  Agreement  further provides that until Asarco holds less
than 10% of Coeur's  outstanding  Common Stock, the following actions by Coeur
will  require the prior  written  consent of Asarco:  (i)  approval of capital
expenditure  budgets and any single project requiring a capital expenditure in
excess of $100 million; (ii) approval of any financial institution,  terms and
conditions  and  amounts  with  respect  to any  standard  lines of  credit or
borrowings to be utilized or secured by Coeur  exceeding  $100 million;  (iii)
the  creation of any lien in excess of $100  million on the assets of Coeur or
any of its  subsidiaries;  (iv) the  discharge  of  auditors  when a  material
dispute exists in connection  with the auditing of Coeur's  books,  records or
financial statements;  (v) the liquidation,  dissolution or general winding-up
of Coeur or any  material  subsidiary  or the filing on behalf of Coeur or any
material  subsidiary  of any  voluntary  petition  seeking  relief  under  the
bankruptcy laws of the relevant jurisdiction;  (vi) any material change in the
nature of Coeur's business from its current business of precious metals mining
and other businesses directly related thereto;  (vii) the issuance by Coeur of
any Common Stock or other class of its capital stock for  consideration  other
than cash for a value in excess of $100 million; (viii) any material amendment
of the  By-Laws or  Articles of  Incorporation  of Coeur which would  conflict
with,  or in any  way be  inconsistent  with,  the  terms  of the  Shareholder
Agreement;  and (ix) any  increase in the number of  directors  of Coeur above
eleven. Asarco will be deemed to have consented to any of the above actions if

                                     -28-

<PAGE>


(i) the  action  shall have been  included  as a  specific  agenda  item for a
meeting of Coeur's Board of Directors,  (ii) the written agenda  together with
all  relevant  information  relating to the  proposed  action  shall have been
delivered  to  directors  in advance of such meeting and (iii) at such meeting
directors  nominated by Asarco vote in favor of such action.  Also, no consent
of Asarco will be required  for any Coeur debt  restructuring,  including  any
exchange, subject to certain conditions.

     Asarco was acquired by Grupo Mexico S.A. on November 17, 1999, subsequent
to Coeur's  entering into the Shareholder  Agreement.  At the Company's Annual
Meeting of Shareholders on May 9, 2000, two persons designated by Grupo Mexico
S.A.  de C.V.  were  elected  to serve as members  of the  Company's  Board of
Directors.

Government Regulation

     General

     During  2000,   the  Company  was  not  cited  for  any   violations   of
environmental or operating regulations and permits.

     The  Company's  commitment  to  environmental   responsibility  has  been
recognized in 19 awards received since 1987, which included the  Dupont/Conoco
Environmental Leadership Award, awarded to the Company on October 1, 1991 by a
judging panel that included  representatives from environmental  organizations
and the federal  government  and the "Star" award  granted on June 23, 1993 by
the National  Environmental  Development  Association,  and the  Environmental
Waikato  Regional  Council  award for Golden  Cross  environmental  initiative
granted on May 15, 1995. In 1994, the Company's  Chairman and Chief  Executive
Officer,  and in 1997,  the  Company's  Vice  President of  Environmental  and
Governmental   Affairs,   were  awarded  the  American  Institute  of  Mining,
Metallurgical   and   Petroleum    Engineers'    Environmental    Conservation
Distinguished Service Award.

     The  Company's  activities  are subject to extensive  federal,  state and
local  laws  governing  the  protection  of  the   environment,   prospecting,
development,  production,  taxes, labor standards,  occupational  health, mine
safety,  toxic  substances and other matters.  Although such  regulations have
never  required the Company to close any mine and the Company is not presently
subject to any material regulatory  proceedings  related to such matters,  the
costs  associated  with  compliance  with  such  regulatory  requirements  are
substantial  and  possible  future  legislation  and  regulations  could cause
additional  expense,  capital  expenditures,  restrictions  and  delays in the
development  of the  Company's  properties,  the  extent  of which  cannot  be
predicted. In the context of environmental permitting,  including the approval
of  reclamation  plans,  the  Company  must comply  with known  standards  and
regulations which may entail significant costs and delays.  Although Coeur has
been  recognized  for  its  commitment  to  environmental  responsibility  and
believes it is in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations,
amendments to current laws and regulations,  the more stringent implementation

                                     -29-

<PAGE>


thereof through  judicial review or  administrative  action or the adoption of
new laws could have a materially adverse effect upon the Company.

     For the  years  ended  December  31,  2000,  1999 and 1998,  the  Company
expended  $7.8  million,  $7.0  million  and $8.0  million,  respectively,  in
connection with routine  environmental  compliance activities at its operating
properties and expects to expend  approximately  $7.4 million for that purpose
in 2001. In addition,  since the inception of the Kensington  project  through
December  31,  2000,  the  Company  expended  approximately  $18.8  million on
environmental  and permitting  activities at the property and expects to spend
approximately  $.6 million there for that purpose in 2001. The expenditures at
Kensington  have been  capitalized  as part of its  development  cost.  Future
environmental  expenditures will be determined by governmental regulations and
the overall scope of the Company's operating and development activities.

     Federal Environmental Laws

     Mining wastes are currently exempt to a limited extent from the extensive
set of Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") regulations governing hazardous
waste,  although such wastes may be subject to regulation under state law as a
solid or  hazardous  waste.  The EPA plans to  develop a program  to  regulate
mining  waste  pursuant  to its solid  waste  management  authority  under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA").  Certain processing and other
wastes are currently  regulated as hazardous wastes by the EPA under RCRA. The
EPA is studying how mine wastes from  extraction  and  benefication  should be
managed and regulated.  If the Company's mine wastes were treated as hazardous
waste or such wastes resulted in operations  being designated as a "Superfund"
site  under  the  Comprehensive   Environmental  Response,   Compensation  and
Liability Act ("CERCLA" or  "Superfund")  for cleanup,  material  expenditures
would be required for the construction of additional waste disposal facilities
or for other  remediation  expenditures.  Under  CERCLA,  any present owner or
operator  of a  Superfund  site or an  owner  or  operator  at the time of its
contamination  generally  may be held  liable  and may be forced to  undertake
remedial  cleanup  action  or to pay for  the  government's  cleanup  efforts.
Additional  regulations or requirements may also be imposed upon the Company's
tailings and waste  disposal in Idaho and Alaska under the Federal Clean Water
Act ("CWA") and state law  counterparts,  and in Nevada under the Nevada Water
Pollution  Control Law which  implements the CWA. Air emissions are subject to
controls  under  Nevada's,   Idaho's  and  Alaska's  air  pollution   statutes
implementing the Clean Air Act.

     Natural Resources Laws

     The  Company is subject to  federal  and state laws  designed  to protect
natural  resources.  In March 1996, the United States  Government  commenced a
lawsuit against various  defendants,  including the Company,  asserting claims
under CERCLA and the CWA for alleged damages to federal  natural  resources in
the  Coeur  d'Alene  River  Basin of  northern  Idaho as a result  of  alleged
releases of hazardous  substances from mining activities conducted in the area
since the late 1800s.  On March 16, 2001, the Company and  representatives  of
the U.S.  Government advised the United States District Court for the District

                                     -30-

<PAGE>


of Idaho that the parties had reached an  agreement in principle to settle the
suit, as more fully discussed under Item 3 below.

     Proposed Mining Legislation

     Recent  legislative  developments  may affect the cost of and  ability of
mining claimants to use the Mining Law of 1872, as amended, (the "Mining Act")
to acquire or use federal lands for mining  operations.  Since October 1994, a
moratorium has been imposed on processing new patent  applications  for mining
claims. Management believes that this moratorium will not affect the status of
patent applications outstanding prior to the moratorium.

     Legislation is presently being considered in the U.S.  Congress to change
the Mining Act under which the Company holds mining claims on public lands. It
is possible that the Mining Act will be amended or be replaced by more onerous
legislation in the future.  The legislation  under  consideration,  as well as
regulations  under  development by the Bureau of Land Management,  contain new
environmental  standards and conditions,  additional reclamation  requirements
and extensive new  procedural  steps which would be likely to result in delays
in permitting.

     During  the  last  several  Congressional   sessions,   bills  have  been
introduced  which  would  supplant  or  materially  alter the Mining  Act.  If
enacted,  such legislation may materially impair the ability of the Company to
develop or continue  operations  which derive ore from federal lands.  No such
bills have been  passed and the extent of the  changes,  if any,  which may be
enacted by Congress is not presently  known. A significant  portion of Coeur's
U.S.  mining  properties are on public lands.  Any reform of the Mining Act or
regulations  thereunder based on these initiatives could increase the costs of
mining activities on unpatented  mining claims,  and as a result could have an
adverse effect on the Company and its results of operations.  Until such time,
if any, as new reform  legislation  or regulations  are enacted,  the ultimate
effects and costs of compliance on the Company cannot be estimated.

     Foreign Government Regulations

     The  mining  properties  of the  Company  that are  located  in Chile are
subject  to  various  government  laws  and  regulations   pertaining  to  the
protection of the air,  surface  water,  ground water and the  environment  in
general,  as well as the health of the work  force,  labor  standards  and the
socioeconomic  impacts of mining facilities upon the communities.  The Company
believes  it is  in  substantial  compliance  with  all  applicable  laws  and
regulations to which it is subject in Chile.

     The Republic of Bolivia,  where the San Bartolome project is located, has
adopted laws and guidelines for  environmental  permitting that are similar to
those in effect in the United  States and other South  American  countries.  A
recently   established   State  Council  for  the  Environment   (CODEMA)  has
responsibility  to  define  policy,   approve  plans  and  programs,   control
regulatory activities and enforce compliance.  The permitting process requires
a thorough  study to determine  the baseline  condition of the mining site and

                                     -31-

surrounding area, an environmental  impact analysis,  and proposed  mitigation
measures to minimize and offset the environmental impact of mining operations.

Maintenance of Claims

     At mining  properties  in the United  States,  including  the  Rochester,
Kensington,  Coeur, Galena and Caladay mines, operations are conducted in part
upon unpatented mining claims, as well as patented mining claims.  Pursuant to
applicable  federal law it is necessary,  in order to maintain the  unpatented
claims,  to pay to the  Secretary of the  Interior,  on or before August 31 of
each year, a claim  maintenance fee of $100 per claim.  This claim maintenance
fee is in lieu of the assessment work requirement  contained in the Mining Law
of 1872.  In addition,  in Nevada,  holders of  unpatented  mining  claims are
required  to pay the  county  recorder  of the  county  in which  the claim is
situated an annual fee of $3.50 per claim. No maintenance fees are payable for
patented  claims.  Patented claims are similar to land held by an owner who is
entitled to the entire  interest in the property with  unconditional  power of
disposition.

     In Chile,  operations are conducted upon mineral  concessions  granted by
the national government.  For exploitation  concessions (somewhat similar to a
U.S. patented claim), to maintain the concession,  an annual tax is payable to
the government before March 31 of each year in the approximate amount of $1.14
per hectare.  For exploration  concessions,  to maintain the right, the annual
tax is approximately $.30 per hectare. An exploration  concession is valid for
a three-year  period.  It may be renewed for new periods  unless a third party
claims the right to explore upon the property,  in which event the exploration
concession  must be  converted  to an  exploitation  concession  in  order  to
maintain the rights to the concession.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

     Federal Natural Resources Action

     On March 22,  1996,  an action  was filed in the United  States  District
Court  for  the  District  of  Idaho  by the  United  States  against  various
defendants, including the Company, asserting claims under CERCLA and the Clean
Water Act for  alleged  damages  to  federal  natural  resources  in the Coeur
d'Alene  River  Basin of  Northern  Idaho as a result of alleged  releases  of
hazardous  substances from mining  activities  conducted in the area since the
late 1800s.

     On  March  16,  2001,  the  Company  and   representatives  of  the  U.S.
Government,  including the Environmental  Protection Agency, the Department of
Interior and the Department of Agriculture,  reached an agreement in principle
to settle the lawsuit, which represents the only suit in which the Company has
been named as a party.  Effectiveness of the settlement and related  dismissal
of the lawsuit against the Company is subject to final Justice  Department and
Court approval.  Pursuant to the terms of the proposed settlement, the Company
will pay the U.S.  Government a total of approximately $3.9 million,  of which
$3.3 million will be paid within 15 days after effectiveness of the settlement
and the remaining $.6 million will be paid within 45 days after  effectiveness
of the settlement. In addition, the Company will (i) pay the United States 50%
of any future  recoveries from insurance  companies for claims for defense and
indemnification  coverage under general liability insurance policies in excess
of  $600,000,  (ii)  accomplish  certain  cleanup  work on the  Mineral  Point
property (i.e., the former Coeur Mine site) and Calladay  property,  and (iii)
make  available  certain  real  property  to be used  as a  waste  repository.
Finally,  commencing five years after  effectiveness  of the  settlement,  the
Company  will be  obligated  to pay net  smelter  royalties  on its  operating
properties,  up to a maximum  of $3  million,  amounting  to a 2% net  smelter
royalty on silver  production if the price of silver  exceeds $6.50 per ounce,
and a $5.00 per ounce net smelter  royalty on gold  production if the price of
gold exceeds  $325 per ounce.  The royalty  would run for 15 years  commencing

                                     -33-

<PAGE>


five  years  after  effectiveness  of  the  settlement.  When  the  settlement
agreement becomes effective,  the Court will issue a consent decree dismissing
the action against the Company.  The Company recorded $4.2 million of expenses
in the fourth quarter of 2000 in connection with the expected settlement.

Lawsuit to Recover Inventory

     During the first quarter of 2000, Handy and Harmon Refining Group,  Inc.,
to which the Rochester Mine had  historically  sent  approximately  50% of its
dore,  filed for Chapter 11  bankruptcy.  The Company had an  inventory at the
refinery of  approximately  67,000  ounces of silver and 5,000  ounces of gold
that has been  delivered to certain  creditors  of Handy and Harmon.  The dore
inventory has a cost basis of $1.7 million.  On February 27, 2001, the Company
commenced a lawsuit  against  Handy and Harmon and certain  others in the U.S.
Bankruptcy  Court for the  District  of  Connecticut  seeking  recovery of the
metals and/or damages.  Although the Company  believes it has a basis for full
recovery, it is premature to predict the outcome of the lawsuit.

(1)  Included in other  income for the year 2000 are:  (i) a gain  recorded on
mark to market of the Company's gold call positions sold of $4.1 million,  and
(ii) loss on investment in Pan American Silver Corp. stock of 2.3 million.

Included  in  other  income  for 1999  are:  (i) a gain of  $21.1  million  in
settlement  of a lawsuit,  and (ii) a loss  recorded  on mark to market of the
Company's gold call positions sold of $4.3 million.

Included  in other  income for 1997 are:  (i) the  receipt of $8.0  million of
insurance proceeds for business interruption and property damage at the Golden
Cross  Mine,  and (ii) a gain of $5.3  million  arising  from the sale of gold
purchased  in the open  market  which was  delivered  pursuant  to fixed price
forward contracts in the first quarter of 1997.

(2)  As  a  consequence  of  the  February  7,  2001  sale  of  the  Company's
shareholding  in  Gasgoyne  Gold  Mines  NL,  which had an  effective  date of
December  31, 2000,  the Company  recorded a  write-down  of $12.2  million to
reflect the excess book value of its  shareholding in Gasgoyne above the $15.6
million sales price.

On March 16,  2001,  representatives  of the  United  States  and the  Company
reached  an  agreement  in  principle  to  settle  the  lawsuit  filed  by the
Government in March 1996 in the U.S.  District Court for the District of Idaho
alleging  response  cost  damages to federal  natural  resources  in the Coeur
d'Alene  River Basin as a result of alleged  releases of hazardous  substances
from  prior  mining  activities  in  the  area.  The  terms  of  the  proposed
settlement,  which are subject to final Justice  Department and Court approval
and are  discussed  above  under  Item 3 ("Legal  Proceedings"),  provide  for
payments by the Company to the Government of approximately $3.9 million plus a
maximum of $3.0 million of future conditional net smelter royalty payments. As
a result,  the Company recorded an expense of  approximately  $4.2 million for
settlement of this lawsuit,  including  $3.9 million in payments and estimated
legal fees and other costs.

During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company evaluated the recoverability of
its  investment  in Yilgarn  Star Mine.  Using a $325 per ounce gold price and
based on undiscounted  future cash flows, in accordance with the standards set
fourth in SFAS 121, the Company  determined  that its  investment in property,
plant and equipment at the Yilgarn Star Mine in Australia  was  impaired.  The
total  amount of the  impairment,  based on  discounted  cash  flows was $16.2
million, and was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1999.

During the first quarter of 1998,  the Petorca mine  continued to operate at a
loss in spite of on-going  efforts to improve ore grades and reduce  operating
costs.  An  evaluation  of  operations  was  completed and as a result of this
evaluation,  the Company determined that a write-down was required to properly
reflect the estimated  realizable  value of Petorca's  mining  properties  and
assets in accordance  with the standards set forth in SFAS 121.  Consequently,
the Company recorded a non-cash write-down for impairment in the first quarter
of 1998 of $54.5 million  relating to its  investment in the Petorca mine. The
charge   included   approximately   $8.3  million  to  satisfy  the  estimated
remediation  and  reclamation  liabilities  at  Petorca  and  to  provide  for
estimated termination costs.

                                     -38-

During the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company evaluated the recoverability of
investments  in both the Fachinal Mine and Kensington  property.  Using a $350
per ounce gold price and based on  estimated  undiscounted  future cash flows,
the Company  determined that its investments in property,  plant and equipment
at the  Fachinal  Mine in  Southern  Chile and at the  Kensington  property in
Alaska were impaired.  The total amount of the impairment  based on discounted
cash flows was $42.9  million  and $121.5  million for the  Fachinal  Mine and
Kensington  property,  respectively,  at December 31, 1998 and was recorded in
the fourth quarter.

In December 1998, the Company performed an analysis of the closure accrual for
the Golden Cross Mine. As a result,  the Company  determined  that there was a
shortfall in the closure accrual and recognized an additional  expense of $4.3
million.

During the  second  quarter  of 1996,  the  Company  determined  that  certain
adjustments  were required to properly  reflect the  estimated net  realizable
value of the Golden  Cross mine.  The Golden  Cross Mine and the nearby  Waihi
East property were written down by approximately  $53 million due to increased
expenditure  requirements  related to  remediation  of ground  movement  which
impacted the tailings impoundment area and the ultimate viability of the mine.
The write-down  included amounts necessary to increase the Company's  recorded
remediation and reclamation  liability at Golden Cross to  approximately  $7.0
million as of December 31, 1996. In addition, the Faride property in Chile was
written down by $1.2 million due to management's  decision not to exercise its
final option payment on the project.

(3)  During  July,  September  and  December  1999,  the  Company  repurchased
approximately $10.2 million principal amount of its outstanding 6% Convertible
Subordinated  Debentures due 2002 for a total purchase price of  approximately
$6.2 million,  excluding  purchased  interest of $.2 million.  Associated with

                                     -39-

<PAGE>


this  transaction,  the Company  eliminated  $.1 million of  capitalized  bond
issuance cost. As a result,  the Company has recorded an extraordinary gain of
approximately $4 million,  net of taxes of zero,  during 1999 on the reduction
of its indebtedness.

During July, August and December 1998, the Company  repurchased  approximately
$4.0 million  principal amount of its outstanding 6% Convertible  Subordinated
Debentures due 2002,  approximately  $36.5 million  principal  amount of its 7
1/4%  Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures due 2005, and  approximately  $1.6
million principal amount of its 6.375% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due
2004 for a total purchase  price of  approximately  $28.5  million,  excluding
purchased   interest  of   approximately   $616,000.   Associated   with  this
transaction,  the Company eliminated $1.4 million of capitalized bond issuance
costs.  The Company  anticipates  that as a result of the  cancellation of the
repurchased debentures, annual interest paid by the Company will be reduced by
approximately  $3.0 million.  As a result of the buyback of these  debentures,
the Company has recorded an extraordinary gain of approximately $12.2 million,
net of taxes, during 1998 on the reduction of its indebtedness.

In June, 2000, the Company  repurchased  approximately  $7.0 million principal
amount of its 6%  Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures due 2002 pursuant to a
cash tender  offer that  commenced  on May 9, 2000 and expired as scheduled on
June 8, 2000. The price paid by the Company for the repurchased debentures was
approximately $5.0 million plus accrued and unpaid interest of $3,500.  During
the quarter ended June 30, 2000, the Company recorded an extraordinary gain of
approximately $1.1 million,  net of tender offer expenses,  as a result of the
repurchase.

During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company repurchased  approximately $2.1
million  principal  amount of its 6% Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures and
approximately  $22.0  million  principal  amount  of  its  outstanding  7 1/4%
Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures  due 2005. The price paid by the Company
for those repurchased  debentures was approximately $8.9 million.  As a result
of those additional repurchases, the Company recorded an extraordinary gain of
approximately $15.0 million.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
        Condition and Results of Operations
        -------------------------------------------------

General

     The results of the Company's operations are significantly affected by the
market  prices of gold and silver which  fluctuate  widely and are affected by
many  factors  beyond  the  Company's   control,   including  interest  rates,
expectations  regarding  inflation,  currency values,  governmental  decisions
regarding  the  disposal of precious  metals  stockpiles,  global and regional
political and economic conditions, and other factors.


Operating Mines

     The Company owns and operates the following producing mines:

1)   Rochester mine, a heap leach silver and gold mine in Nevada

2)   Galena mine, an underground  silver mine in the Coeur d'Alene district of
     Idaho

3)   Petorca mine, an underground gold mine in Chile; and

4)   Fachinal mine, an open pit and underground gold and silver mine in Chile

     Prior to the sale in February 2001, the Company  previously  owned 50% of
Gasgoyne Gold Mines NL, an Australian gold mining company ("Gasgoyne"),  which
owns 50% of the  Yilgarn  Star mine in Western  Australia  and  various  other
exploration properties. On February 7, 2001, the Company sold this interest to
Sons of Gwalia for A$28.1 million (US$15.6 million).

     On April 28, 1998,  the Company  discontinued  mining  operations  at the
Golden  Cross mine in New Zealand,  in which the Company had an 80%  operating
interest.

Total Production and Reserves

     The Company's total  production in 2000 was 11.7 million ounces of silver
and  145,000  ounces of gold,  compared  to 9.6  million  ounces of silver and
152,000 ounces of gold in 1999.  Coeur  estimates that production in 2001 will
be  approximately  11.5  million  ounces of silver and 82,000  ounces of gold.
Total  estimated  proven and  probable  reserves  at  December  31,  2000 were
approximately  88.1 million  ounces of silver and 2.4 million  ounces of gold,
compared to silver and gold  reserves at  December  31, 1999 of  approximately
89.3 million ounces and 2.6 million ounces, respectively.

SFAS 121 Impairment Reviews; Write-down of Mining Properties

     In accordance with Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and Long-Lived  Assets to
be Disposed Of" ("SFAS 121"),  the Company  reviews the carrying  value of its
assets whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate that the carrying
amount  of its  assets  may not be  fully  recoverable.  Generally,  SFAS  121
provides that an asset impairment  exists if the total amount of the estimated

                                     -41-

<PAGE>


future  undiscounted  cash flows of the asset are less than the carrying value
of the asset. If it is determined that  impairment  exists,  the amount of the
impairment  loss that should be  recorded,  if any, is the amount by which the
carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.

     As of December  31,  2000,  due to the  continuing  low gold  price,  the
Company  reviewed the carrying  value of all its  properties  using  long-term
prices  starting at $275 and  increasing  to $300 per ounce for gold and $4.90
increasing  to $5.50 per ounce for  silver.  As a result of this  review,  the
Company  determined  that the  undiscounted  estimated  future cash flows were
sufficient to fully recover the carrying value of its investments.  During the
year ended December 31, 1999, based on an assumed gold price of $325 per ounce
and a  silver  price of $5.50  per  ounce,  the  Company  recorded  a SFAS 121
write-down of $16.2 million to its investment in Gasgoyne.

                             Results of Operations

Year Ended  December  31,  2000  Compared  to Year  Ended  December  31,  1999
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Sales of Metal

     Sales of  concentrates  and dore increased by $6.9 million,  or 7.9%, for
the year ended  December  31,  2000 as  compared  to the same  period of 1999,
primarily attributable to higher silver production levels at the Rochester and
Silver Valley mines,  offset in part by decreases in the realized silver price
and the amount of gold produced.  During 2000, the Company produced a total of
11.7  million  ounces of silver and  145,000  ounces of gold  compared  to 9.6
million ounces of silver and 152,000 ounces of gold in 1999.

     Spot  silver  and  gold  prices   averaged  $5.00  and  $279  per  ounce,
respectively,  in 2000 compared to $5.25 and $279 per ounce, respectively,  in
1999.  During 2000,  the Company  realized  average  silver and gold prices of
$4.94 and $307 per ounce, respectively, compared with realized prices of $5.23
and $319, respectively, in 1999.

     Other Income

     Interest and other income  decreased  by $14.6  million,  or 65%, in 2000
compared to 1999.  The decrease was  primarily due to a $21.1 million net gain
from the  favorable  settlement in the third quarter of 1999 of a lawsuit with
Cyprus Minerals Company  relating to the Golden Cross mine,  reduced by a loss
of $4.3 million  arising from the non-cash  mark to market  adjustment on gold
call options sold by the Company.

                                  ($ millions)

     For the year ended December 31, 2000,  total expenses  increased by $23.9
million.  The increase is primarily  attributable to the increased  production
costs as a result of the increase in ownership of the Galena mine in increased
production costs at the Fachinal and Petorca mines.

     Production  costs  increased by $19.8  million in 2000.  The increase was
primarily  due to  increased  ownership of the Galena mine from 50% to 100% in
September  1999 and increased cash costs per ounce at the Fachinal and Petorca
mines.  Depreciation  and  depletion  expense  increased  $1.2 million in 2000
compared to 1999,  primarily  due to higher  production  at the  Rochester and
Galena mines.  Administration  and general  expenses  increased $.4 million in
2000, 5% above 1999. Exploration expense for 2000 increased by $.9 million, or
10%, compared to 1999.

     Cash costs per ounce of silver equivalent at the Rochester mine decreased
to $3.90 in 2000 compared to $3.97 per ounce in 1999.  The decrease was due to
operating  improvements that included  increasing the capacity of the conveyor
system and the crushing  circuit as well as  increasing  solution  flow on the
leach pad by  approximately  15%.  Cash costs at Silver  Valley were $4.59 per
silver ounce in 2000  compared to $5.09 in 1999.  The decrease was primarily a
result of improved ore grades from more  productive  vein  structures at depth
and an increase  in mill  throughput.  Cash costs at the Petorca  mine in 2000
averaged  $345 per ounce of gold versus  $271 in 1999.  The  increase  was the
result of the mining of lower grade ore, partially offset by increases in tons
mined and in mill  throughput.  Cash costs at Fachinal were $447 per ounce for
the year ended  December  31, 2000  compared to $304 per ounce in the previous
year.  The increase was primarily  due to a shortfall in production  partially
due to lower ore  grades and a  reduction  in tons  milled,  but mainly due to

                                     -43-

<PAGE>


continuation  of  severe  winter  weather  conditions  that  affected  most of
southern  Chile.  The cash costs at the  Yilgarn  Star mine for the year ended
December 31, 2000 were $227 per gold ounce compared to $287 per gold ounce for
1999.  The  reduction  in cash costs was  achieved  in spite of the  scheduled
mining of lower  grade ore,  by  implementing  operating  improvements  to the
crushing circuit, and a weaker Australian dollar.

     Write-downs of mining  properties  and other  expenses  amounted to $21.2
million in 2000,  primarily as a result of (i) a write-down  of $12.2  million
reflecting the excess book value of the Company's shares in Gasgoyne above the
$15.6  million  price for which the  Company  sold such  shares on February 7,
2001,  and (ii)  recognition  of $4.2 million in connection  with the expected
settlement of the federal  natural  resources  lawsuit,  of which $3.9 million
represents  payments expected to be made by the Company to the U.S. Government
and the balance  consists of estimated land transfer  expenses and legal fees.
Write-downs of mining  properties and other expenses in 1999 amounted to $20.2
million  primarily  as a result  of the  $16.2  million  SFAS  121  impairment
write-down of the Yilgarn Star mine.

Net Loss

     The Company's loss before income taxes and extraordinary  items was $63.6
million in 2000 compared to a loss before income taxes and extraordinary items
of $32.0 million in 1999. The Company  reported an income tax provision of $.3
million for 2000 and 1999. In 2000, the Company recorded an extraordinary gain
on the early  retirement of debt (net of taxes) of $16.1 million and paid $2.2
million in preferred stock dividends.  As a result, the Company reported a net
loss attributable to common  shareholders of $50.0 million, or $1.41 per share
in 2000,  compared to $38.9  million,  or $1.61 per share in 1999. The reduced
per share amount of the net loss attributable to common  shareholders in 2000,
notwithstanding the increased total dollar amount of such net loss, was due to
the  increase  in the  weighted  average  number of  shares  of  common  stock
outstanding during 2000.

Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1998
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales of Metal

     Sales of concentrates and dore' decreased by $16.2 million, or 15.8%, for
the year  ended  December  31,  1999 as  compared  to the same  period of 1998
primarily as a result of lower  production  levels at  Rochester  and Fachinal
mines and a decreased realized silver price. During 1999, the Company produced
a total of 9,596,833  ounces of silver and 151,656  ounces of gold compared to
10,703,178  ounces of silver and 209,959  ounces of gold in 1998.  Spot silver
and gold  prices  averaged  $5.25 and $279 per  ounce,  respectively,  in 1999
compared  to $5.53  and $294 per  ounce in  1998.  During  1999,  the  Company
realized  average  silver  and gold  prices of $5.23  and $319,  respectively,
compared with realized prices of $5.37 and $312 in 1998.

<PAGE>


Other Income

     Interest and other income  increased by $13.2  million,  or 139%, in 1999
compared to 1998. The increase was primarily the result of: (i) the receipt of
$21.1  million in net  proceeds  from the  favorable  settlement  in the third
quarter of 1999 of a lawsuit  with  Cyprus  Minerals  Company  relating to the
Golden Cross mine,  offset by (ii) a loss of $4.3 million arising from the non
cash mark to market adjustment on gold call options sold by the Company.

                                  ($ millions)

     For the year ended December 31, 1999, total expenses  decreased by $216.5
million. The decrease is primarily attributable to the combined $218.9 million
write-downs of the Petorca and Fachinal mines and the Kensington  property and
an  adjustment  of $4.2 million to the closure  accrual at Golden Cross in the
fourth  quarter  of 1998  compared  to the  $16.2  million  write-down  of the
Company's investment in Gasgoyne in 1999.

     Production  costs  decreased  by $3.3  million in 1999.  The decrease was
primarily due to lower production  levels in 1999.  Depreciation and depletion
decreased  $9.0  million  in 1999  compared  to 1998,  primarily  due to lower
production  and the reduction in carrying  value at the Fachinal mine in 1998.
Administration  and general  expenses  decreased  $3.0 million in 1999, or 24%
below 1998. The decrease was due to the implementation of a comprehensive cost
reduction program.  Exploration  expense for 1999 decreased by $.7 million, or
8%, under 1998.

     The cash  costs per  ounce of silver  equivalent  at the  Rochester  mine
decreased to $3.97 in 1999  compared to $4.07 per ounce in 1998.  The decrease
was due to a lower strip  ratio in the open pit in 1999.  Cash costs at Silver
Valley were $5.09 per silver  ounce in 1999  compared  to $4.39 in 1998.  Cash
costs at the Petorca Mine in 1999  averaged $271 per ounce of gold versus $336
in 1998.  The  decrease  was the  result of  improved  productivity  following
implementation of a modified mining plan. Cash costs at Fachinal were $304 per
ounce for the year ended  December 31, 1999  compared to $314 per ounce in the
previous  year.  The decrease was primarily a result of cost savings  programs

                                     -45-

<PAGE>


implemented  in 1999.  The cash  costs at the  Yilgarn  Star mine for the year
ended  December  31,  1999 were $287 per gold ounce  compared to $215 per gold
ounce for 1998. The increase  resulted from: (i) the planned  transition  from
open pit mining to higher cost underground  mining, (ii) reduced ore grade and
throughput, particularly in the fourth quarter; and (iii) flooding of portions
of the underground mine by unusually heavy rains which delayed the development
and extraction of higher-grade ore.

Net Loss

     The Company's loss before income taxes and extraordinary  items was $32.0
million in 1999  compared  to a loss of $245.5  million in 1998.  The  Company
reported an income tax  provision  of $.3  million  for 1999,  compared to $.9
million in 1998. In 1999, the Company recorded an extraordinary  gain on early
retirement  of debt (net of taxes) of $4.0,  the  Company  reported a net loss
attributable to common  shareholders of $38.9 million,  or $1.61 per share, in
1999, compared to $244.8 million, or $11.18 per share in 1998.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Working Capital; Cash and Cash Equivalents

     The  Company's  working  capital at December  31, 2000 was  approximately
$93.0 million  compared to $157.9  million at December 31, 1999.  The ratio of
current  assets to current  liabilities  was 4.7 to one at  December  31, 2000
compared to 8.5 to one at December 31, 1999.

     Net cash used in operating  activities in 2000 was $23.8 million compared
with  $2.9  million  provided  by  operating  activities  in  1999.  The  most
significant  non-cash items partially  offsetting the net loss from continuing
operations  in  2000  were  $26.7  million  of  depreciation,   depletion  and
amortization expense, and non-cash write-downs of $14.5 million.

     A total  of  $10.0  million  was  used in  investing  activities  in 2000
compared  to $26.1  million  used in  1999.  The  most  significant  investing
activities  in 2000  were:  (i)$15.2  million  in  proceeds  from  the sale of
short-term  investments,  offset by $12.7 million used to purchase  short-term
investments,  (ii) $1.8 million spent on developmental  properties,  and (iii)
$9.6 million spent on operational mining properties.

     The  Company's  financing  activities  used  $17.9  million  during  2000
compared  to $17.2  million  used in  1999.  The  most  significant  financing
activities in 2000 were the $14.9 million used to  repurchase  long-term  debt
and $2.6 million in dividends paid to preferred shareholders. As a result, the
Company's net cash decreased in 2000 by $51.7 million compared with a net cash
decrease of $40.4 million in 1999.

     The  Company's  capital  budget  for the year 2001 is  estimated  at $8.7
million.  Expenditures  for  remediation and reclamation for the year 2001 are

                                     -46-

<PAGE>


estimated  to be $1.7  million.  The Company  has  budgeted  $7.6  million for
exploration and pre-feasibility development in 2001, primarily to add reserves
at its  operating  properties  and to continue to evaluate  the San  Bartolome
project in Bolivia.  The Company  expects that all of these cash  requirements
will be fulfilled  by cash flow from  continuing  operations  augmented by its
cash on hand.

Conversion of MARCS to Common Shares

     On March 15,  2000,  the  Company  mandatorily  converted  its  7,077,833
outstanding  shares of MARCS into  7,863,000  shares of common stock,  and the
final dividend payment of $2.6 million on the MARCS was made as of that date.

Federal Natural Resources Action

     On March 22,  1996,  an action  was filed in the United  States  District
Court  for  the  District  of  Idaho  by the  United  States  against  various
defendants, including the Company, asserting claims under CERCLA and the Clean
Water Act for  alleged  damages  to  federal  natural  resources  in the Coeur
d'Alene  River  Basin of  Northern  Idaho as a result of alleged  releases  of
hazardous  substances from mining  activities  conducted in the area since the
late 1800s.

     On  March  16,  2001,  the  Company  and   representatives  of  the  U.S.
Government,  including the Environmental  Protection Agency, the Department of
Interior and the Department of Agriculture,  reached an agreement in principle
to settle the lawsuit, which represents the only suit in which the Company has
been named as a party.  Effectiveness of the settlement and related  dismissal
of the lawsuit against the Company is subject to final Justice  Department and
Court approval.  Pursuant to the terms of the proposed settlement, the Company
will pay the U.S.  Government a total of approximately $3.9 million,  of which
$3.3 million will be paid within 15 days after effectiveness of the settlement
and the remaining $.6 million will be paid within 45 days after  effectiveness
of the settlement. In addition, the Company will (i) pay the United States 50%
of any future  recoveries from insurance  companies for claims for defense and
indemnification  coverage under general liability insurance policies in excess
of  $600,000,  (ii)  accomplish  certain  cleanup  work on the  Mineral  Point
property (i.e., the former Coeur Mine site) and Calladay  property,  and (iii)
make  available  certain  real  property  to be used  as a  waste  repository.
Finally,  commencing five years after  effectiveness  of the  settlement,  the
Company  will be  obligated  to pay net  smelter  royalties  on its  operating
properties,  up to a maximum  of $3  million,  amounting  to a 2% net  smelter
royalty on silver  production if the price of silver  exceeds $6.50 per ounce,
and a $5.00 per ounce net smelter  royalty on gold  production if the price of
gold exceeds  $325 per ounce.  The royalty  would run for 15 years  commencing
five  years  after  effectiveness  of  the  settlement.  When  the  settlement
agreement becomes effective,  the Court will issue a consent decree dismissing
the action against the Company.  The Company recorded $4.2 million of expenses
in the fourth quarter of 2000 in connection with the expected settlement.

Proposed Legislation

     Recent  legislative  developments  may affect the cost of and  ability of
mining claimants to use the Mining Law of 1872, as amended, (the "Mining Act")
to acquire or use federal lands for mining  operations.  Since October 1994, a
moratorium has been imposed on processing new patent  applications  for mining
claims. Management believes that this moratorium will not affect the status of
patent applications outstanding prior to the moratorium.

     During  the  last  several  Congressional   sessions,   bills  have  been
introduced  which  would  supplant  or  materially  alter the Mining  Act.  If
enacted,  such legislation may materially impair the ability of the Company to
develop or continue  operations  which derive ore from federal lands.  No such
bills have been  passed and the extent of the  changes,  if any,  which may be
enacted by Congress are not presently known.

Environmental Compliance Expenditures

     For the  years  ended  December  31,  2000,  1999 and 1998,  the  Company
expended  $7.8  million,  $7.0  million  and $8.0  million,  respectively,  in
connection with routine  environmental  compliance activities at its operating
properties.  Such  activities  at the  Rochester,  Golden  Cross,  Petorca and
Fachinal mines include monitoring,  bonding, earth moving, water treatment and
revegetation  activities.  In addition,  since the inception of the Kensington
project  through  December 31, 2000, the Company had expended a total of $18.8
million on environmental and permitting activities at the property.

     The Company estimates that environmental  compliance  expenditures at its
Kensington  developmental  property  during 2001 will be $.6 million to obtain
permit modifications and other regulatory authorizations. Future environmental
expenditures  will be determined by  governmental  regulations and the overall
scope of the  Company's  operating  and  development  activities.  The Company
places a very high priority on its compliance with environmental regulations.

Capitalized Development Expenditures

     During  2000,  the  Company   expended  $1.6  million  for   engineering,
optimization  studies and permitting  costs at the Kensington  property,  $2.2
million at the Rochester mine, $2.6 million for continuing mine development at
the  Fachinal  mine,  $.7 million at the Petorca  mine and $6.4 million at the
Galena  mine.  During  2001,  the  Company  plans to expend  $2.0  million  at
Kensington,  $1.6 million for developmental  activities at the Rochester mine,
$2.9 million at the Galena mine.  If the Company were to decide to construct a
mining  facility at Kensington,  the Company  currently  estimates the cost at
approximately $181 million over an eighteen-month  period for construction and
development.

Realization of Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

     The Company has reviewed its net  deferred tax asset,  together  with net
operating loss  carryforwards,  and has not recognized  potential tax benefits

                                     -48-

<PAGE>


arising  therefrom  on the  view  that it is more  likely  than  not  that the
deferred deductions and losses will not be realized in future years. In making
this  determination,  the Company has considered the Company's  history of tax
losses incurred since 1989,  current gold and silver prices and the ability of
the  Company to use  accelerated  depletion  and  amortization  methods in the
determination of taxable income.


Issuance of Common Stock in Exchange for Outstanding Debentures in March 2001

     On March 19,  2001,  the Company  issued a total of  1,787,500  shares of
Common Stock to two holders of a total of $5 million  principal  amount of the
Company's outstanding 7 1/4% Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures due 2005 in
exchange for such  Debentures.  The  Company's  financial  statements  for the
quarter  ending  March  31,  2001,  will  record  an  extraordinary   gain  of
approximately  $3.0  million  representing  the  excess  of  the  extinguished
principal  amount of that  Debenture  liability  over the value of the  shares
issued by the  Company in  exchange,  net of  offering  costs and  taxes.  The
Company paid  approximately  $140,000 of accrued interest on the Debentures in
connection with the exchange transactions.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
         ----------------------------------------------------------

     The  Company  is  exposed  to  various  market  risks  as a  part  of its
operations.  In an effort to mitigate losses  associated with these risks, the
Company may, at times, enter into derivative financial instruments.  These may
take the form of forward sales contracts,  foreign currency exchange contracts
and interest rate swaps.  The Company does not actively engage in the practice
of trading derivative  securities for profit. This discussion of the Company's
market risk assessments  contains  "forward  looking  statements" that contain
risks and  uncertainties.  Actual results and actions could differ  materially
from those discussed below.

     The Company's  operating  results are  substantially  dependent  upon the
world market prices of silver and gold. The Company has no control over silver
and gold  prices,  which can  fluctuate  widely and are  affected  by numerous
factors,  such as  supply  and  demand  and  investor  sentiment.  In order to
mitigate some of the risk associated with these fluctuations, the Company will
at times, enter into forward sale contracts and/or,  put/call option contracts
to hedge the effects of price fluctuations.  The Company continually evaluates
the potential benefits of engaging in these strategies based on current market
conditions. The Company may be exposed to nonperformance by counterparties or,
during periods of significant price  fluctuation,  margin calls as a result of
its hedging activities.

     The Company  operates and therefore incurs expenses in Bolivia and Chile.
This exposes the Company to risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange
rate, relative to the U.S. dollar, of the currencies involved.  As part of its
program to manage  foreign  currency risk, the Company will enter into foreign
currency  forward  exchange  contracts.  These contracts enable the Company to
purchase a fixed amount of foreign  currency at a predetermined  price.  Gains
and losses on foreign exchange  contracts that are related to firm commitments
are designated as hedges and are deferred and recognized in the same period as

                                     -49-

<PAGE>


the related transaction. All other contracts that do not qualify as hedges are
marked to market and the  resulting  gains or losses are  recorded  in income,
currently.  The  Company  continually  evaluates  the  potential  benefits  of
entering into these contracts to mitigate  foreign  currency risk and proceeds
when it believes that the exchange rates are most beneficial.

     All of the  Company's  long-term  debt at December 31, 2000 is fixed rate
based. The Company's exposure to interest rate risk, therefore,  is limited to
the amount it could pay at current  market rates.  The Company  currently does
not have any derivative  financial  instruments to offset the  fluctuations in
the market interest rate. It may choose to use  instruments,  such as interest
rate swaps,  in the future to manage the risk  associated  with  interest rate
changes.

     See  Note  M -  Financial  Instruments,  to  the  consolidated  financial
statements  for a table  which  summarizes  the  Company's  gold  and  foreign
exchange hedging activities at December 31, 2000.

     Long-term debt  obligations  and related  interest rates are presented in
detail in Note I to the consolidated financial statements.

                REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT


To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Coeur d'Alene Mines Corporation:

     We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of Coeur
d'Alene  Mines  Corporation  (an  Idaho  corporation)  and  subsidiaries  (the
"Company")  as of  December  31, 2000 and 1999,  and the related  consolidated
statements of operations  and  comprehensive  loss,  changes in  shareholders'
equity,  and cash flows for the years then ended.  These financial  statements
are the responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our audits in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted  in the  United  States.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles used
and  significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our  opinion,  the  financial  statements  referred  to above  present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Coeur
d'Alene Mines  Corporation and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
and the consolidated  results of their operations and their cash flows for the
years then ended in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the United States.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
               COEUR D'ALENE MINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

     (Dollar amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified)

     NOTE A--BUSINESS OF COEUR D'ALENE MINES CORPORATION

     Coeur  d'Alene  Mines  Corporation  and its  subsidiaries  (collectively,
"Coeur" or the "Company") is principally engaged in silver and gold mining and
related  activities  including  exploration,  development,  and  mining at its
properties  located in the United States (Nevada,  Idaho and Alaska) and South
America (Bolivia and Chile).

     NOTE B--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Principles  of  Consolidation:   The  consolidated  financial  statements
include the wholly-owned  subsidiaries of the Company, the most significant of
which are Coeur Rochester Inc., Coeur Silver Valley Inc., Coeur Alaska,  Inc.,
CDE Fachinal Ltd., Compania Minera CDE Petorca,  Coeur Australia (50% owner of
Gasgoyne Gold Mines NL), and Empressa Minera Manquiri S.R.L.  The consolidated
financial statements also include all entities in which voting control of more
than 50% is held by the Company.  Intercompany  balances and transactions have
been  eliminated in  consolidation.  Investments  in joint  ventures where the
Company  has  ownership  of 50% or less and funds its  proportionate  share of
expenses are accounted for under the equity method.

     Revenue Recognition:  Revenue is recognized when title to silver and gold
passes at the  shipment  or  delivery  point.  The  effects of  forward  sales
contracts and purchased put contracts are reflected in revenue at the date the
related precious metals are delivered or the contracts expire.

     Cash  and  Cash  Equivalents:  Cash  and  cash  equivalents  include  all
highly-liquid  investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date
of purchase.  The Company  minimizes its credit risk by investing its cash and
equivalents with major international banks and financial  institutions located
principally in the United  States,  Canada and Australia with a minimum credit
rating of A1 as  defined  by  Standard  &  Poor's.  The  Company's  Management
believes  that  no  concentration  of  credit  risk  exists  with  respect  to
investment of its cash and equivalents.

     Inventories:  Inventories of ore on leach pads and in the milling process
are valued based on actual costs incurred to place such ores into  production,
less costs  allocated to minerals  recovered  through the leaching and milling
processes.  Inherent in this valuation is an estimate of the percentage of the
minerals  on leach  pads and in process  that will  ultimately  be  recovered.
Management  evaluates  this estimate on an ongoing  basis.  Adjustments to the
recovery rate are  accounted  for  prospectively.  All other  inventories  are
stated at the lower of cost or market,  with cost being  determined  using the
first-in,  first-out and weighted average cost methods.  Concentrate and dore'
inventory  includes  product at the mine site and product held by  refineries,
and are valued at lower of cost or market.

     Property,  Plant,  and  Equipment:  Property,  plant,  and  equipment are
recorded at cost.  Depreciation,  using the straight-line  method, is provided

                                     F-9

<PAGE>


over the  estimated  useful  lives of the assets,  which are 7 to 31 years for
buildings and improvements, 3 to 13 years for machinery and equipment and 3 to
7 years for furniture and fixtures.  Certain  mining  equipment is depreciated
using the  units-of-production  method based upon  estimated  total proven and
probable reserves. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

     Mining  Properties:  Values for mining properties  represent  acquisition
costs and/or the fair value of consideration  paid plus  developmental  costs.
Cost depletion has been recorded based on the units-of-production method based
on proven and probable reserves.  Management  evaluates the net carrying value
of all operations,  property by property,  when events or conditions  indicate
that the  potential for  permanent  impairment  of value  exists.  The Company
utilizes  the  methodology  set forth in  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standard ("SFAS") No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets
and Long Lived  Assets to be Disposed Of" to evaluate  the  recoverability  of
capitalized  mineral  property  costs.  Since SFAS No. 121 requires the use of
forward-looking  projections,  the Company  must use  estimates  to generate a
life-of-mine  undiscounted  cash flow forecast.  These  estimates are based on
projections  made  by  the  Company's  engineers  and  geologists,   projected
operating and capital costs necessary to process the estimated  product,  each
project's mine plan including the type,  quantity and ore grade expected to be
mined,  estimated  metallurgical  recovery and other factors which may have an
impact upon a project's future cash flow. In addition, the Company is required
to estimate the selling price of metal produced.

     Reclamation  Costs:  Post-closure  reclamation and site restoration costs
are estimated based on environmental  regulatory  requirements and are accrued
ratably  over the life of the mine using the  units-of-production  method.  At
December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company has recorded accrued reclamation costs
of $19.2 million and $17.3 million,  respectively,  net of estimated equipment
salvage values.

     Exploration and Development: The value of exploration properties acquired
is capitalized at the fair market value of the consideration paid. After it is
determined that proven and probable  reserves exist on a particular  property,
the property is classified as a  developmental  property and all costs related
to the further  development  of the  property  are  capitalized.  Prior to the
establishment  of  proven  and  probable  reserves,   all  costs  relative  to
exploration and evaluation of a property are expensed as incurred. In order to
classify an identified mineral resource as proven and probable  reserves,  the
Company must have completed a favorable  feasibility  study.  Mine development
costs  incurred to access  reserves on producing  mines are also  capitalized.
Short-term   Investments:   Short-term  investments   principally  consist  of
highly-liquid  United States and foreign  government and corporate  securities
with original maturities in excess of three months. The Company classifies all
short-term investments as available-for-sale securities.  Unrealized gains and
losses on these  investments are recorded in accumulated  other  comprehensive
loss as a separate  component of shareholders'  equity.  Any decline in market
value judged to be other than  temporary  are  recognized in  determining  net
income.  Realized  gains  and  losses on these  investments  are  included  in
determining net income.

                                     F-10

<PAGE>


     Foreign  Currency:  Substantially  all assets and  liabilities of foreign
subsidiaries  are  translated  at exchange  rates in effect at the end of each
period.  Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for
the period.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the
determination of net income.

     Derivative Financial  Instruments:  The Company uses derivative financial
instruments as part of an overall risk-management  strategy. These instruments
are used as a means of hedging  exposure to precious metals prices and foreign
currency  exchange  rates.  The  Company  does not  hold or  issue  derivative
financial instruments for trading purposes. Written options do not qualify for
hedge  accounting  and  are  marked  to  market  each  reporting  period  with
corresponding changes in fair value recorded to operations as Other Income.

     The Company uses forward sales contracts and combinations of put and call
options to hedge its exposure to precious metals prices. The underlying hedged
production is designated at the inception of the hedge. Deferral accounting is
applied only if the  derivatives  continue to reduce the price risk associated
with the  underlying  hedged  production.  Contracted  prices on forward sales
contracts  and  options  are  recognized  in product  sales as the  designated
production  is delivered or sold.  In the event of early  settlement  of hedge
contracts,  gains and  losses are  deferred  and  recognized  in income at the
originally designated delivery date.

     The Company  uses  foreign  currency  contracts  to hedge its exposure to
movements  in  the  foreign  currency   translation  amounts  for  anticipated
transactions.  These contracts are marked-to-market to earnings each reporting
period.

     In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued SFAS No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No.
133 requires that all  derivatives be recognized as assets or liabilities  and
be measured  at fair  value.  Gains or losses  resulting  from  changes in the
values of those  derivatives will be accounted for depending on the use of the
derivatives  and whether  they qualify for hedge  accounting  as either a fair
value hedge or a cash flow hedge.  The adoption of SFAS No. 133 by the Company
on January 1, 2001 will not have a material affect of the financial statements
of the Company.

     Comprehensive Loss: In addition to net loss,  comprehensive loss includes
all changes in equity during a period, except those resulting from investments
by and distributions to owners.

     Loss Per  Share:  Loss per share is  computed  by  dividing  the net loss
attributable  to common stock by the weighted  average number of common shares
outstanding  during each  period.  The effect of  potentially  dilutive  stock
options outstanding was antidilutive in 2000, 1999 and 1998.

     Use of Estimates:  The preparation of financial  statements in conformity
with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States requires
the Company's  management to make  estimates and  assumptions  that affect the
reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities,  the  disclosure  of  contingent
assets  and  liabilities  at the  date of the  financial  statements,  and the

                                     F-11

<PAGE>


reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

     Reclassifications:  Certain reclassifications of prior year balances have
been made to conform to current year presentation.

NOTE C--SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Sale of Shareholding in Gasgoyne Gold Mines NL

     On February 7, 2001,  the Company sold its 50%  shareholding  in Gasgoyne
Gold Mines NL of Australia  ("Gasgoyne") for A$28.1 million (US $15.6 million)
in cash.  The purchaser  was Sons of Gwalia Ltd.,  an  Australian  corporation
headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, who owned the other 50% interest in
Gasgoyne.

     The  principal  assets of Gasgoyne  are its 50%  ownership of the Yilgarn
Star  mine and  exploration  tenements  located  in  Western  Australia.  Also
included in the sale was Coeur's  share of Gasgoyne's  gold hedge  position of
approximately 90,000 ounces.

     As a result of the  transaction,  the Company  recorded a  write-down  of
$12.2 million in December 2000, reflecting the excess of the carrying value of
the Company's Gasgoyne shares over the sale price.

Issuance  of Common  Stock in  Exchange  for 7 1/4%  Convertible  Subordinated
Debentures

     On March 19, 2001, the Company issued a total of 1,787,500  shares of its
Common Stock to two holders of a total of $5 million  principal  amount of the
Company's outstanding 7 1/4% Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures due 2005 in
exchange for such  Debentures.  The  Company's  financial  statements  for the
quarter  ending  March  31,  2001  will  record  an   extraordinary   gain  of
approximately  $3.0  million  representing  the  excess  of  the  extinguished
principal  amount of the  Debenture  liability  over the  value of the  shares
issued by the Company in exchange, net of offering costs and taxes.

NOTE D--SFAS NO. 121 IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS


     During  the fourth  quarter of 2000,  the  Company  performed  impairment
reviews on all it's operational and development  properties in accordance with
the standards set forth in SFAS No. 121, and based on  undiscounted  estimated
future cash flows and/or fair market value assessments,  using long-term price
assumptions starting at $4.90 and increasing to $5.50 per ounce for silver and
$275 and  increasing to $300 per ounce for gold, the Company  determined  that
its  investments  in  property,  plant and  equipment  for the  operating  and
development properties were not impaired at December 31, 2000.

     During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company  recorded an impairment of
its  investment  in the  Yilgarn  Star  mine.  Using a  long-term  gold  price
assumption of $325 per ounce and based on undiscounted  future cash flows, the
Company  determined  that its investment in the Yilgarn Star mine in Australia
was impaired.  The total amount of the  impairment,  based on discounted  cash
flows was $16.2  million at December 31, 1999,  and was recorded in the fourth
quarter.

     During the first quarter of 1998,  the Petorca mine  continued to operate
at a loss in spite of  on-going  efforts  to  improve  ore  grades  and reduce
operating  costs. An evaluation of operations was completed and as a result of
this  evaluation,  the Company  determined  that a write-down  was required to
properly reflect the estimated realizable value of Petorca's mining properties
and  assets  in  accordance  with the  standards  set  forth in SFAS No.  121.
Consequently, the Company recorded a non-cash write-down for impairment in the
first  quarter of 1998 of $54.5  million  relating  to its  investment  in the
Petorca mine. The charge  included  approximately  $8.3 million to satisfy the
estimated  remediation and  reclamation  liabilities at Petorca and to provide
for estimated termination costs.

     During  the  fourth   quarter  of  1998,   the  Company   evaluated   the
recoverability  of  investments  in both  the  Fachinal  Mine  and  Kensington
property.   Using  a  $350  per  ounce  gold  price  and  based  on  estimated
undiscounted future cash flows, the Company determined that its investments in
property,  plant and equipment at the Fachinal  Mine in Southern  Chile and at
the  Kensington  property in Alaska  were  impaired.  The total  amount of the
impairment based on discounted cash flows was $42.9 million and $121.5 million
for the Fachinal Mine and Kensington property,  respectively,  at December 31,
1998 and was recorded in the fourth quarter.

27, 2001, the Company  commenced  litigation to recover its dore', with a cost
basis  of $1.8  million,  and  believes  it has a  basis  for  full  recovery.
Accordingly,  no  impairment  has been  recorded for this asset.  Although the
Company believes it has a basis for full recovery,  it is premature to predict
the outcome of the lawsuit.

     Operational Mining Properties


     The  Rochester  Mine:  The Company owns and operates this silver and gold
surface mine. The Company has conducted operations at the Rochester Mine since
September  1986. The mine utilizes the  heap-leaching  process to extract both
silver and gold from ore mined using open pit methods. Rochester is one of the
largest  primary  silver mines in the United States and is a significant  gold
producer as well.

     Galena Mine: Coeur Silver Valley owns and operates the Galena underground
silver-copper  mine,  located  near the city of Wallace,  in Shoshone  County,
Northern Idaho.  On September 9, 1999, the Company  acquired the remaining 50%
of Coeur Silver Valley  resulting in 100% ownership for the Company.  The mine
utilizes  the drift and fill mining  method with sand  backfill to extract ore
from the high grade  silver-copper  vein deposits that constitute the majority
of the ore reserves.

     Fachinal  Mine:  The  Fachinal  Mine is a gold  and  silver  open pit and
underground  mine  located  in  southern  Chile.   Commercial  production  for
financial  reporting  purposes  commenced  on  January 1,  1997.  The  Company
suspended  operations in the fourth quarter 2000 to fully evaluate and develop
a recently discovered zone of high-grade gold and silver mineralization.

     Petorca  Mine:  The Company owns and operates the Petorca gold and silver
underground  mine  located in central  Chile  approximately  90 miles north of
Santiago.

     Yilgarn Star Mine: The Company had a 25% indirect interest in the Yilgarn
Star mine in Western  Australia.  The mine is a surface and  underground  gold
mine  operated by Sons of Gwalia.  Coeur sold its interest in the Yilgarn Star
mine in February 2001. (See Note C.)

Developmental Properties

     San  Bartolome  Project:  On  September  9, 1999,  the  Company  acquired
Empressa Minera Manquiri  ("Manquiri").  Manquiri's principal asset is the San
Bartolome project, a silver exploration and development  property located near
the  city  of  Potosi,   Bolivia.   The  San  Bartolome  project  consists  of
silver-bearing  gravel deposits which lend themselves to simple surface mining
methods.  The mineral  rights for the San  Bartolome  project are held through
long-term joint venture/lease agreements with several local independent mining
co-operatives  and the  Bolivian  State  owned  mining  company,  COMIBOL.  As
consideration for these JV/leases, production from San Bartolome is subject to
a royalty of 4% payable to the cooperatives and COMIBOL.

     Kensington  Project:  Kensington is a gold property  located near Juneau,
Alaska,  which has been permitted for development based on a feasibility study
which was completed in early 1998.  However,  due to the  currently  depressed
gold price, the Company has continued with engineering optimization efforts to
reduce estimated capital costs and operating costs. The property is subject to
a royalty  which  ranges from 1% at $400 gold prices to a maximum of 2 1/2% at
gold prices above $475, with a royalty cap at 1 million ounces of production.

     The valuation allowance represents the amount of deferred tax assets that
more  likely than not will not be  realized  in future  years.  Changes in the
valuation  allowance  relate  primarily  to  losses  which  are not  currently
recognized.  The Company has reviewed  its net  deferred tax assets,  together
with net operating loss  carryforwards,  and has not recognized  potential tax
benefits arising therefrom because at this time management believes it is more
likely than not that the benefits will not be realized in future years.

     The Company  intends to reinvest the unremitted  earnings of its non-U.S.
subsidiaries  and postpone  their  remittance  indefinitely.  Accordingly,  no
provision  for U.S.  income  taxes was  required on such  earnings  during the
three-year  period ended December 31, 2000. It is not  practicable to estimate
the tax liabilities which would result upon such repatriation.

     A  reconciliation  of the  Company's  effective  income tax rate with the
federal statutory tax rate for the periods indicated is as follows:

     On May 11, 1999,  the Company's  shareholders  adopted a new  shareholder
rights plan.  The plan entitles  each holder of the Company's  Common Stock to
one right.  Each right entitles the holder to purchase one  one-hundredth of a
share of newly authorized  Series B Junior Preferred Stock. The exercise price
is $100, making the price per full preferred share ten thousand  dollars.  The
rights will not be  distributed  and become  exercisable  unless and until ten
business days after a person acquires 20% of the outstanding  common shares or
commences  an offer that would  result in the  ownership of 30% or more of the
shares. Each right also carries the right to receive upon exercise that number
of Coeur  common  shares  which  has a market  value  equal to two  times  the
exercise  price.  Each preferred share issued is entitled to receive 100 times
the  dividend  declared per share of Common Stock and 100 votes for each share
of Common Stock and is entitled to 100 times the liquidation  payment made per
common  share.  The  Board  may  elect to  redeem  the  rights  prior to their
exercisability  at a price of one cent  ($.01) per right.  The new rights will
expire on May 24, 2009,  unless earlier  redeemed or exchanged by the Company.
Any preferred shares issued are not redeemable. At December 31, 2000 and 1999,
there were a total of 37,050,068 and 29,181,217  outstanding  rights which was
equal to the number of outstanding shares of common stock.

Incentive Plan (the "Long-Term  Plan") and a Directors' Plan (the  "Directors'

1998.

     Under  the  Long-Term  and  Directors'  Plans,  benefits  consist  of (i)
non-qualified and incentive stock options that are exercisable at prices equal
to the  fair  market  value  of the  shares  on the  date of  grant  and  vest

the date of grant,  and (ii)  performance  units comprised of Common Stock and
cash, the value of which is determined  four years after the award.  The first
award performance units were granted in 1994. During 2000, options for 233,294
shares were issued under these plans. As of December 31, 2000 and December 31,
1999,  nonqualified and incentive stock options to purchase 708,266 shares and
502,506  shares,  respectively,  were  outstanding  under  the  Long-Term  and
Directors'  Plans. The options are exercisable at prices ranging from $2.63 to
$27.00 per share. In December 2000, the Board of Directors passed a resolution
to request  shareholders  to  authorize  an  additional  1,000,000  shares for
issuance under these plans.

200,000  shares of Common  Stock are  authorized  for  issuance and which were
approved  by the  shareholders  in May 1995.  In December  2000,  the Board of
Directors  passed a  resolution  to put forward for  shareholder  approval the
authorization  of an additional  500,000  shares for issuance  under the Plan.
Under the Plan,  options are granted  only in lieu of an  optionee's  foregone
annual  directors'  fees.  As of  December  31,  2000,  December  31, 1999 and
December 31, 1998, a total of 46,691, 25,917 and 21,005 options, respectively,

     As of December  31,  2000,  1,614,398  shares were  available  for future
grants under these incentive  Plans and 9,523,363  shares of Common Stock were
reserved for potential conversion of Subordinated Convertible Debentures.

     SFAS No.  123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation"  establishes
accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation plans
and  defines  a fair  value  based  method  of  accounting  for  these  equity
instruments.  The method measures  compensation expense based on the estimated
fair value of the award and recognizes  that expense over the vesting  period.
The Company has adopted the  disclosure  - only  provision of SFAS No. 123 and
therefore continues to account for stock options in accordance with Accounting
Principles  Board Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."
Accordingly, because options are granted at fair market value, no compensation
expense has been  recognized  for options  issued  under the  Company's  stock
option plans. Had compensation expense been recognized based on the fair value
at the date of the grant for the options  awarded  under the plans,  pro-forma
amounts of the  Company's  net loss and net loss per share  would have been as
follows:

     The fair value of each option grant was estimated using the Black Scholes
option pricing model with the following  weighted  average  assumptions:  risk
free  interest  rate  of  6.0%,  6.2%  and  6.2%  for  2000,  1999  and  1998,
respectively;  expected  option life of 4-10 years for officers and directors;
expected volatility of 92%, 55% and 43% for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively,
and no expected  dividends.  The effect of applying SFAS No. 123 for providing
pro forma disclosures for fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998 is not likely to be
representative  of the effects in future  years  because  options  vest over a
four-year period and additional awards generally are made each year.

NOTE L--EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Defined Benefit Plan
 -------------------

     In connection  with the  acquisition  of certain  Asarco  silver  assets,
acquired in 1999, the Company is required to maintain non-contributory defined
benefit  pension plans  covering  substantially  all employees at Coeur Silver
Valley.  Benefits for salaried plans are based on salary and years of service.
Hourly plans are based on negotiated benefits and years of service.

     The  Company's  funding  policy  is to  contribute  amounts  to the plans
sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements set fourth in the Employee
Retirement  Income  Security Act of 1974,  plus such additional tax deductible

                                     F-23

amounts as may be advisable under the circumstances.  Plan assets are invested
principally in commingled stock funds,  mutual funds and securities  issued by
the United States Government.

     The components of net periodic benefit costs are as follows:

     401(k) Plan

     The Company  maintains  a savings  plan (which  qualifies  under  Section
401(k)  of  the  U.S.  Internal  Revenue  code)  covering  all  eligible  U.S.

     NOTE M--FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     Off-Balance Sheet Risks

     The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts denominated in
foreign  currencies.  The purpose of the Company's  foreign  exchange  hedging
program is to protect  the  Company  from risk that the  eventual  dollar cash
flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. At December 31,
2000,  1999, and 1998, the Company had forward foreign  exchange  contracts of
$8.1 million, $3.6 million, and $4.6 million in USD, respectively.

     The Company enters into forward metal sales contracts to manage a portion
of its cash flows against  fluctuating gold and silver prices.  As of December
31, 2000,  the Company had sold 24,000  ounces of gold for delivery on various
dates  through  2002 at an  average  price  of  $324.17.  For  metal  delivery
contracts,  the realized  price  pursuant to the contract is  recognized  when
physical gold or silver is delivered in satisfaction of the contract.  For the
years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,  Coeur recorded  non-cash  earnings of
$4.0  million  and  a  non-cash   charge  of  $4.3   million  to   operations,
respectively.  At December 31,  2000,  based on the spot gold price of $274.45
per ounce, the Company's complete hedging position was valued at $2.4 million,
including the call options sold.

     The  Company  realized  cash  gains  of $4.0  million  arising  from  the
deliveries  of gold into  purchased put options and forward  contracts  during
2000.

     Further  discussions of other financial  instruments  held by the Company
are included in Note E and Note I.

     For the years  ended  December  31,  2000,  1999,  and 1998,  the Company
realized a gain (loss) from its foreign  exchange  programs of $(1.0) million,
$.1 million and $(.5) million, respectively.

     The credit risk exposure related to all hedging  activities is limited to
the unrealized gains on outstanding  contracts based on current market prices.
To reduce counter-party  credit exposure,  the Company deals only with a group
of large credit-worthy financial  institutions,  and limits credit exposure to
each.  In addition,  to allow for  situations  where  positions may need to be
reversed,  the Company deals only in markets that it considers  highly liquid.
The  Company  does not  anticipate  non-performance  by any of  these  counter
parties.

NOTE N--SEGMENT INFORMATION

     Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which
separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the
chief operating decision maker, or  decision-making  group, in deciding how to
allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company's chief operating
decision-making  group is  comprised  of the Chief  Executive  Officer,  Chief
Financial Officer and the Chief Operating Officer.

     The  operating  segments  are managed  separately  because  each  segment
represents a distinct use of company  resources  and  contribution  to Company
cash  flows  in its  respective  geographic  area.  The  Company's  reportable
operating segments include the Rochester,  Coeur Silver Valley,  Fachinal, and
Petorca mining  properties,  Coeur Australia (50% owner of Gasgoyne Gold Mines
NL), and exploration and development  properties.  All operating  segments are
engaged in the  discovery  and/or  mining of gold and silver and  generate the
majority  of  their  revenues  from  the  sale  of  these   precious   metals.
Intersegment revenues consist of precious metals sales to the Company's metals
marketing  division and are  transferred at the market value of the respective
metal on the date of  transfer.  The  other  segment  includes  the  corporate
headquarters,   elimination  of  intersegment  transactions  and  other  items
necessary to reconcile to consolidated amounts.  Revenues in the other segment
includes sales through a wholly owned commodity marketing subsidiary,  and are
generated  principally  from interest  received  from the  Company's  cash and
investments that are not allocated to the operating  segments.  The accounting
policies of the  operating  segments  are the same as those  described  in the

                                     F-27

<PAGE>


summary of  significant  accounting  policies  above.  The  Company  evaluates
performance and allocates  resources based on profit or loss before  interest,
income taxes, depreciation and amortization, unusual and infrequent items, and
extraordinary items.

     Revenues from gold sales were $43.5  million,  $48.9  million,  and $55.7
million in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Revenues from silver sales were
$57.3  million,  $43.7  million,  and  $46.8  million  in  2000,  1999,  1998,
respectively.

NOTE O--LITIGATION

Federal Natural Resources Action

     On March 22,  1996,  an action  was filed in the United  States  District
Court  for  the  District  of  Idaho  by the  United  States  against  various
defendants, including the Company, asserting claims under CERCLA and the Clean
Water Act for  alleged  damages  to  federal  natural  resources  in the Coeur
d'Alene  River  Basin of  Northern  Idaho as a result of alleged  releases  of
hazardous  substances from mining  activities  conducted in the area since the
late 1800s.

     On  March  16,  2001,  the  Company  and   representatives  of  the  U.S.
Government,  including the Environmental  Protection Agency, the Department of
Interior and the Department of Agriculture,  reached an agreement in principle
to settle the lawsuit, which represents the only suit in which the Company has
been named a party.  Effectiveness of the settlement and related  dismissal of
the lawsuit  against the Company is subject to final  Justice  Department  and
Court approval.  Pursuant to the terms of the proposed settlement, the Company
will pay the U.S.  Government a total of approximately $3.9 million,  of which
$3.3 million will be paid within 15 days after effectiveness of the settlement
and the remaining $.6 million will be paid within 45 days after  effectiveness
of the settlement. In addition, the Company will (i) pay the United States 50%
of any future  recoveries from insurance  companies for claims for defense and
indemnification  coverage under general liability insurance policies in excess
of  $600,000,  (ii)  accomplish  certain  cleanup  work on the  Mineral  Point
property (i.e., the former Coeur Mine site) and Calladay  property,  and (iii)
make  available  certain  real  property  to be used  as a  waste  repository.
Finally,  commencing five years after  effectiveness  of the  settlement,  the
Company  will be  obligated  to pay net  smelter  royalties  on its  operating
properties,  up to a maximum  of $3  million,  amounting  to a 2% net  smelter
royalty on silver  production if the price of silver  exceeds $6.50 per ounce,
and a $5.00 per ounce net smelter  royalty on gold  production if the price of
gold exceeds  $325 per ounce.  The royalty  would run for 15 years  commencing
five  years  after  effectiveness  of  the  settlement.  When  the  settlement
agreement becomes effective,  the Court will issue a consent decree dismissing
the action against the Company.

     As a result of the settlement, the Company has recorded a charge to other
expense  of $4.2  million in the fourth  quarter of 2000 which  includes  $3.9
million of settlement  payments,  the land transfer expenses and related legal
fees.

Lawsuit to Recover Inventory

     During the first quarter of 2000, Handy and Harmon Refining Group,  Inc.,
to which the Rochester Mine had  historically  sent  approximately  50% of its
dore,  filed for Chapter 11  bankruptcy.  The Company had an  inventory at the
refinery of  approximately  67,000  ounces of silver and 5,000  ounces of gold
that has been  delivered to certain  creditors  of Handy and Harmon.  The dore
inventory has a cost basis of $1.8 million.  On February 27, 2001, the Company
commenced a lawsuit  against  Handy and Harmon and certain  others in the U.S.
Bankruptcy  Court for the  District  of  Connecticut  seeking  recovery of the
metals and/or damages.  Although the Company  believes it has a basis for full
recovery, it is premature to predict the outcome of the lawsuit.
