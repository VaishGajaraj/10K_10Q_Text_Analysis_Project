of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, provide a "safe harbor" for forward-looking
statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their companies. With the exception of historical information, the matters discussed in this Annual Report on
Form&nbsp;10-K are forward-looking statements and may be identified by the use of words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "estimate," "intend" and "potential." Such
statements reflect the current view of the Registrant with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. A variety of factors could cause the Registrant's
actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results expressed in such forward-looking statements, including, among other things, general economic conditions, acquisitions and development
of new businesses, product availability, sales volumes, profit margins, weather, availability of suitable real estate locations, and the impact of labor markets and new product introductions on the
Registrant's overall profitability. Readers should review the Registrant's Current Report on Form&nbsp;8-K filed on May&nbsp;16, 2001, that describes additional important factors that

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minneapolis-based Best Buy Co.,&nbsp;Inc. (Company or Registrant), is the nation's number one specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home office
equipment, entertainment software and appliances. The Company operates retail stores and commercial Web sites under the brand names Best Buy (BestBuy.com), Media Play (MediaPlay.com), On Cue
(OnCue.com), Sam Goody (SamGoody.com), Suncoast (Suncoast.com) and Magnolia Hi-Fi (MagnoliaHiFi.com). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company began in 1966 as an audio components retailer, and in the early 1980s, with the introduction of the videocassette recorder, expanded into video products. In 1983, the
Company revised its marketing strategy and began using mass-merchandising techniques, which included offering a wider
variety of products and operating stores under a "superstore" format. In 1989, the Company dramatically changed its method of retailing by introducing a self-service, noncommissioned,
discount-style store format designed to give the customer more control over the purchasing process. The Company determined that an increasing number of customers had become knowledgeable enough to
select products without the assistance of a commissioned salesperson and preferred to make purchases in a more convenient and customer-friendly environment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
fiscal 1995, the Company developed a larger store format (45,000 and 58,000 square feet) that featured more hands-on and interactive product demonstrations. This
concept was based on focus group interviews and other research, which indicated that customers wanted more product information and a larger product selection. In fiscal 1999, the Company introduced a
new store format with improved merchandising, signage and customer service. This format, designed to address changing consumer needs, particularly as the consumer electronics industry progressed into
new digital products, also reinforced the Company's image as the destination for new technology in a fun, informative and no-pressure shopping environment. In fiscal 2000, the Company
introduced a small-market store format that serves communities of generally less than 200,000 people. These 30,000-square-foot stores offer the same product categories as
larger stores, but have more flexible floor plans and product assortments tailored to their communities. During fiscal 2001, the Company introduced its latest store format, which features a flexible
merchandising architecture, faster checkout and better product adjacencies and is expected to result in a more effective labor model and improved merchandising. Most new Best Buy stores are expected
to incorporate the features of this latest store format. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of March&nbsp;3, 2001, the Company operated 419 Best Buy stores in 41 states. The stores average 45,400 square feet and produce average annual sales of nearly $39&nbsp;million.
Best Buy stores collectively had 19.0&nbsp;million retail square feet, or 68% of the Company's total retail square footage. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting
in fiscal 2003, the Company plans to begin international expansion with the first Best Buy stores opening in Canada prior to the calendar 2002 holiday season. The Canadian
marketplace is attractive because of the sizeable population, high median incomes, strong annual spending in consumer electronics and limited competition in the Company's business sector. Canadian
Best Buy stores will vary in size depending on the needs of the location. It is expected that approximately 60 to 65 Best Buy stores will be opened throughout Canada in the next three to four years. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company acquired Musicland Stores Corporation (Musicland) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 to continue its revenue growth beyond fiscal 2005, when the Company expects to
complete its Best Buy store expansion in the United States. Musicland, which is also based in Minneapolis, is one of the largest national retailers of pre-recorded music, videos, books,
computer software, video games and other entertainment-related products. The mall-based music and video stores include the Sam Goody and Suncoast brands. In addition, Musicland operates
rural On Cue stores and metropolitan, large-format Media Play stores. At fiscal year-end, Musicland operated approximately 1,300 stores in 49
states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, with 8.8&nbsp;million total retail square feet. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Musicland acquisition adds more than 300&nbsp;million additional customer visits per year, as well as access to several consumer market segments typically underserved by Best
Buy stores: women, young adults and rural consumers. The Musicland acquisition also significantly increased the Company's market share in sales of pre-recorded music and movies and further
positioned the Company to lead the anticipated migration to digital product and connectivity services. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam
Goody is a mall-based specialty music retailer offering a broad product selection in a youthful, consumer-friendly shopping environment. Sam Goody stores specialize in
music entertainment products, including compact discs, DVD's, videos, audiocassettes, music and movie videos, sheet music, music-inspired apparel, posters and other music-related accessories. The
stores are predominantly located in malls and average approximately 4,500 square feet, although they range in size from 1,000 to 30,000 square feet. The larger stores generally are located in more
prominent mall or downtown locations and carry a broader inventory of catalog product, including substantial classical and jazz music offerings as well as deep video assortments. In many cases, Sam
Goody is the exclusive music retailer in the mall. As of March&nbsp;3, 2001, the Company operated approximately 630 Sam Goody stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The total retail square footage of these Sam Goody stores was approximately 3.0&nbsp;million square feet, or 11% of the Company's total retail square footage. The
average annual sales per Sam Goody store are approximately $1.2&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suncoast
is a mall-based video retailer, emphasizing a broad product selection and elite customer service in a Hollywood-inspired atmosphere. Suncoast stores average
approximately 2,400 square feet and feature newly released and classic movies, special interest videos and episodes from popular TV shows. Complementary products include apparel, posters and other
products inspired by new releases, as well as blank videotapes, storage cases and other video-related accessories. Suncoast offers movies in both VHS format and DVD format. At March&nbsp;3, 2001,
there were approximately 400 Suncoast stores in 47 states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The total square footage of Suncoast stores was approximately
1.0&nbsp;million square feet, or 4% of the Company's total retail square footage. The average annual sales per Suncoast store are approximately $1.0&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
Cue stores are located in small or rural cities, generally with 10,000 to 30,000 people, providing a wide assortment of entertainment products at competitive prices. On Cue stores

videos, computer software, electronics, video games and related products. On Cue customers have access to more than 6,000 music and video titles as well as a comprehensive selection of book titles
through a special order program. The in-store boutique, "Jam Central," features a selection of musical instruments including keyboards, guitars, microphones, amplifiers, starter drum sets
and sheet music, as
well as accessories. As of March&nbsp;3, 2001, the Company operated approximately 200 On Cue stores in 31 states with total retail square footage of approximately 1.3&nbsp;million square feet, or
5% of the Company's total retail square footage. The average annual sales per On Cue store are approximately $800,000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Media
Play is a superstore retailer located in major metropolitan markets offering a large assortment of home entertainment products at competitive prices. The family-oriented Media
Play stores are operated primarily in freestanding and strip mall locations in urban and suburban areas. The average store measures approximately 46,000 square feet and carries a broad assortment of
movies, music, books, computer software, video games, electronics, computer software, musical instruments and toys. The "M.P. Kids" department houses a play area for children and a wide array of
children's movies, books and educational toys. "Game Zone" allows a customer to try out new or used video games and sell or trade their used video games. The "Jam Central" area is similar to that
found in On Cue stores. At March&nbsp;3, 2001, Media Play operated approximately 80 stores in 20 states with total square footage of approximately 3.6&nbsp;million, or 12% of the Company's total
retail square footage. The average annual sales per Media Play store are approximately $7.1&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
Dec.&nbsp;15, 2000, the Company acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi,&nbsp;Inc. (Magnolia Hi-Fi), a retailer of high-end consumer electronics which was
founded in Seattle in 1954. As of March&nbsp;3, 2001, the company operated 13 stores in Washington, Oregon and California that average 10,200 square feet with average annual sales per store of
$8.4&nbsp;million. Magnolia Hi-Fi stores provide audio and video home theater systems for homes, automobiles and businesses. The stores offer
top-of-the-line consumer electronics brands through a commissioned sales force. Magnolia Hi-Fi operates a
state-of-the-art design center as well as an in-house repair/installation department. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Business Strategy  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's vision is to be at the intersection of technology and life. The Company's business strategy is to bring technology and consumers together in a
retail environment that focuses on educating consumers on the features and benefits of technology and entertainment while maximizing overall profitability. The Company believes that Best Buy stores
offer consumers meaningful advantages in store environment, product value, selection and service. An objective of this strategy has been to achieve a significant market share in the markets it serves.
The latest Best Buy store format features interactive displays and, for certain product categories, a high level of customer assistance, both designed to enhance the customer's shopping experience. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best
Buy's store format is a key component of its business strategy. The Company believes that because consumers are generally familiar with certain products Best Buy sells and are
accustomed to discount shopping formats, they resist efforts to direct their choice of product and appreciate controlling the purchase decision. For products that are relatively easy for consumers to
understand and purchase, Best Buy stores employ a self-service, discount-style store format, featuring easy-to-locate product groupings, emphasizing customer choice
and product information. These products include entertainment software and less complex consumer electronics products such as VCRs and small televisions. For other, more complex and integrated
products such as personal computers, digital and big-screen televisions, home theater, digital phones and digital cameras, Best Buy dedicates specially trained sales assistance. Sales
staff in these product categories help customers understand the features and benefits of new technology and can assist customers in the purchase of accessories and registration for service with
providers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most
Best Buy stores contain a demonstration area for home theater systems, big-screen televisions and audio speakers. These demonstration areas allow customers to
experience and compare product performance firsthand. Best Buy believes that these demonstration and display areas further differentiate it from competing retailers and create an advantage over
competitors that operate exclusively through catalogs or the Internet. In addition, all Best Buy stores feature a configure-to-order process for personal computers that enables
computer buyers to custom-order a computer system from such vendors as Compaq and Hewlett-Packard. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best
Buy spends approximately 3% of store sales on advertising, including the weekly distribution of approximately 48&nbsp;million newspaper inserts. The Company is reimbursed by
vendors for a substantial portion of advertising expenditures through cooperative advertising arrangements. Best Buy has vertically integrated advertising and promotion capabilities, and operates an
in-house advertising agency. This capability permits the rapid response to competitor promotions in a cost-effective manner. In many markets, Best Buy is able to secure and
deliver merchandise to stores and to create, produce and run an insert all within a period of less than one week. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best
Buy's print advertising generally consists of four-color weekly inserts, typically 24 to 32 pages, that emphasize a variety of product categories and feature an
extensive name-brand selection with a wide range of price points. In addition, the Company utilizes television advertising to support a national brand image campaign that positions Best
Buy stores as the destination for new technology products that enhance customers' time by making it more productive and more fun. The Company believes that building customer brand loyalty is a
significant element of its business strategy. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2>6</FONT></P>

<HR NOSHADE>
<!-- ZEQ.=4,SEQ=5,EFW="2049390",CP="BEST BUY CO., INC.",DN="1",CHK=216309,FOLIO='6',FILE='DISK026:[01STP0.01STP2070]DE2070A.;11',USER='PKIEU',CD='31-MAY-2001;15:27' -->
<A NAME="page_de2070_1_7"> </A>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product service and repair are important aspects of Best Buy's brand strategy, providing the opportunity to differentiate its stores from the retailers that do not offer such
services. Best Buy stores generally offer to service and repair all of the products it sells, with the exception of entertainment software. Best Buy has been designated by substantially all major
suppliers as an authorized servicer. In addition, Best Buy makes in-store technical support staff available to assist customers with the custom configuration of personal computers and
peripheral products. Best Buy offers home delivery of major appliances and large electronics products. In addition, Best Buy installs car stereos, vehicle security systems and certain major
appliances. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
fiscal 2001, the Company re-launched its commercial Web site, BestBuy.com, which sells products over the Internet in Best Buy's principal product categories except
appliances. The Company views the site as part of a fully integrated "clicks-and-mortar" strategy, offering a consistent and synchronized experience across both stores and
Internet channels while tapping the unique advantages of each.
Consumers can choose to pick-up or return their online purchases at one of the Best Buy stores, and inside Best Buy stores they can use WebStations&#153; to expand the product
assortment available to them. The "clicks-and-mortar" strategy also leverages the Company's existing nationwide Best Buy store network with Best Buy's brand awareness,
substantial advertising and promotional activities, warranty and repair capabilities, and supply chain, warehousing and logistics network. While customer-fulfillment through its Web site does not
currently represent a significant portion of Best Buy's business, management believes that the development of a comprehensive Internet business represents a significant growth opportunity and that its
clicks-and-mortar strategy gives the Company a competitive advantage over Internet retailers. In addition, the Company believes that the product information provided to
consumers on the BestBuy.com Web site has the ability to increase overall in-store traffic. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company recognized that forming strategic alliances with service providers would be an integral component of its strategy to provide full service to consumers and increase
profitability. In March&nbsp;2000, the Company announced a strategic alliance with Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) that encompassed significant co-marketing activities between the
Microsoft Network of Internet Services (MSN&#153;), BestBuy.com and Best Buy's retail stores via direct marketing and advertising inserts, among other things. Microsoft is providing technology
support to Best Buy and BestBuy.com and supported BestBuy.com with prominent placement across Microsoft properties such as MSNBC, MSN, Hotmail, Expedia and Carpoint. In exchange for its role in
generating new subscribers for MSN, the Company shares in the profits derived from those subscribers. In connection with the alliance, Microsoft purchased approximately 3.9&nbsp;million shares of
the Company's common stock for $200&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

acquisitions of Musicland and Magnolia Hi-Fi give the Company access to new distribution channels, new customers and the ability to leverage Best Buy core competencies
to their operations. Additional benefits are expected to accrue from the cross merchandising of products and information sharing across distribution channels. The post-acquisition strategy
includes increasing productivity and re-positioning Musicland stores to an improved new concept, including an infusion of new digital products that are expected to appeal to the Sam Goody
customer. Initial initiatives include post-merger integration and the remerchandising of Sam Goody stores. </FONT></P>

Hi-Fi's strategy is to provide superior customer service in the store, during installation and following installation. The stores are spacious, pleasant

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Buy stores offer customers a broad selection of name-brand models consisting of approximately 6,000 products, exclusive of entertainment
software titles and accessories, in four principal product categories. In addition, they offer a selection of accessories supporting those principal product categories. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
home office category, Best Buy's largest category, includes desktop and notebook computers and related peripheral equipment, telephones, digital communication devices, personal
digital assistants, answering machines and calculators. Desktop computer sales have slowed as the percentage of households owning computers has risen. Revenue growth in this category is expected to be
driven by increased demand for products providing mobile access to people and information along with the related sale of connectivity services. The Company signed up 1.3&nbsp;million new ISP
subscriptions in fiscal 2001 and plans to continue to be a leader in the sale of connectivity services. As of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, approximately 35% of the sales in this category were
derived from sales of personal computers including desktops, notebooks and configure-to-order computers. The retail market for personal computers can be promotional and
competitive, with competition primarily from retail stores and factory-to-customer direct channels of distribution. Operating results can be affected by significant changes in
promotional activity, consumer demand, availability of personal computers and the timing of computer model transitions. The timing of significant new software releases also can impact sales of
personal computers. The Company believes it is well positioned to withstand competition in the retail market for personal computer products, traditionally low margin items, due to its experience in
the market and its significantly improved ability to manage inventories in this category. The Company also </FONT></P>

believes that Best Buy's broad product lines, including those that generate higher gross profit margins, and its relatively low cost structure contribute to the Company's ability to compete in this
category. In addition, the Company believes that the related services Best Buy offers, such as knowledgeable salespeople, in-store computer configuration, maintenance and upgrades, are
distinct advantages compared to Internet, discount and factory direct computer retailers. Changing technology and hardware requirements necessary to support new software, including online services,
are expected to continue to be primary factors in the growth in sales of personal computers and related products in the future. Personal computer unit sales growth has been driven by technology
improvements, the increasing popularity of the Internet and declining retail selling prices. In fiscal 2000 and 2001, Internet service provider rebate offers to new subscribers on the purchase of
their personal computers further stimulated computer sales. While the sales of personal computer hardware generate relatively low gross profit margins, Best Buy's selling strategies have enabled the
Company to generate higher total transaction profit margins through the sale of accessories and services that complete a home computer system. Best Buy's list of home office brand names includes
leading vendors such as AT&amp;T, Belkin, Canon, Cingular, Compaq, Emachine, Epson, Handspring, Hewlett-Packard, Kodak, Lexmark, Motorola, Microsoft Service Network (MSN), Nokia, Olympus, Palm, Panasonic,
Sony, Sprint, Toshiba and VoiceStream. </FONT></P>

Buy's second-largest, but fastest-growing, product category is consumer electronics, consisting of video and audio equipment. The growth is driven by the continued expansion of
digital technology products. Digital technology products improve the consumers' audio and video experience and enable them to connect and interact at home, work or on the road. Video products include
home theater systems, television sets, DVD players, VCRs, camcorders, cameras and digital broadcast satellite systems (DBS). Audio products include audio components, audio systems, shelf systems,
portable audio equipment, car stereos and other electronics. Best Buy continues to expand its product selection of consumer electronics by offering higher-end products and components that
have greater appeal to audio and video enthusiasts. In recent years, the introduction of digital televisions, DVD players, digital cameras, digital camcorders and DBS systems continues the migration
of the consumer electronics category into digital technology. The replacement of existing analog technology with digital products
represents a significant sales growth opportunity for the Company; although as prices drop, quantities increase and new technology becomes more affordable, the transition could impact sales of current
products. To date, however, increasingly affordable digital consumer electronics products have contributed to sales growth. Continued technology advancements are expected to result in the development
and availability of new, more sophisticated digital products, continuing to fuel growth in this category. Best Buy sells consumer electronics with brand names such as Aiwa, Bose, Canon, DIRECTV,
Funai, JBL, JVC, KLH, Minolta, Nikon, Panasonic, Philips, Pioneer, RCA, Rockford Fosgate, Samsung, Sanyo, Sharp, Sony, Technics, Toshiba, WebTV and Yamaha. </FONT></P>

Buy's entertainment software category includes compact discs, DVD and VHS movies, computer software, and video game hardware and software. Best Buy is one of the few large
consumer electronics retailers that sells a broad selection of entertainment software. Best Buy customizes a portion of the entertainment software assortment for particular stores based upon the
demographics of the market. Video game hardware, video game software and computer software sales are also impacted by the development of new technology. The addition of new video game hardware and
software from Microsoft and Nintendo Company, Ltd. combined with the popularity to date of the Sony Playstations are expected to positively impact sales in this category. </FONT></P>

improvement retailers and other large retailers selling major appliances makes this category highly competitive and promotional, despite the exit of a major competitor from the appliance category in
fiscal 2001. While the appliance category represents less than 10% of total Company sales, the Company believes that it can grow its market share in this category. In addition to increasing its market
share, the Company plans to work closely with suppliers to improve the overall profitability of the category. Historically, the high costs associated with the logistics, repair and installation of
major appliances have put pressure on the category's financial performance. </FONT></P>

Buy's "other" category includes sales of Performance Service Plans (PSPs), furniture and other miscellaneous products such as batteries, business cases and blank audio and
videotapes and compact disks. Best Buy sells PSPs on behalf of an unrelated third party. These contracts cover product repair and/or replacement for a specified period of time following the purchase
of a product, extending and enhancing the manufacturer's warranty. PSP sales comprised 3.9% of Best Buy revenues in fiscal 2001 and are impacted by changes in unit volume of personal computers,
appliances and other products. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Best Buy  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company opened 62 Best Buy stores in fiscal 2001, including entries into the new markets of the New York City Area and Norfolk, Va. The Company expects to
open approximately 60 Best Buy stores in fiscal 2002, including approximately 20 small-market format stores. The Company also plans to remodel or relocate approximately six Best Buy stores to larger
facilities. The Company expects to open approximately 60 Best Buy stores per year through fiscal 2005, at which time the Company expects to have completed its Best Buy store expansion in the United
States. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best
Buy's expansion strategy generally has been to enter major metropolitan areas with the simultaneous opening of several stores and then to expand into contiguous
non-metropolitan markets. In fiscal 2001, the Company continued to broaden its existing strategy and opened 11 small-market Best Buy stores bringing the total small-market format to 20
stores. As of March&nbsp;3, 2001, approximately 75% of Best Buy stores were in the 50 largest metropolitan markets. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
entry into a new market is preceded by a market analysis, including a review of competitors, demographics and economic data. The store location strategy enables Best Buy to
increase the effectiveness of advertising expenditures and to create a high level of consumer awareness. In addition, the clustering of stores allows Best Buy to maintain more effective management
control and utilize distribution facilities more efficiently. Currently, Best Buy stores cover approximately 70% of the United States population and serve 47 of the 50 largest metropolitan markets. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
entering a major metropolitan market, Best Buy usually establishes a district office, service center and major appliance warehouse. New stores require working capital of
approximately $4&nbsp;million for merchandise inventory (net of vendor financing), leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment. Pre-opening costs of approximately $550,000 per store,
excluding advertising costs associated with the grand opening of a store, are incurred through hiring, relocating and training new employees, and in merchandising the store. These costs are expensed
as incurred. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Suppliers, Purchasing and Distribution  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Buy's marketing strategy depends, in part, upon the ability to offer customers a broad selection of name-brand products and is, therefore,
dependent upon satisfactory and stable supplier relationships. In fiscal 2001, Best Buy's 20 largest suppliers accounted for over half of the merchandise Best Buy purchased, with five
suppliers&#151;Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Panasonic, Sony and Toshiba&#151;representing approximately 33% of total purchases for Best Buy stores. The loss of or disruption in supply,
including disruptions in supply due to manufacturers' product quality or component parts availability issues, from any one of these major suppliers could have a material adverse effect on Best Buy
sales. Higher than expected demand also places a strain on certain suppliers at times, resulting in suppliers limiting or temporarily discontinuing their supply of products to retailers, including
Best Buy. For instance, when new products are introduced, manufacturers are at times unable to supply sufficient quantities to meet the high demand. Best Buy generally does not have
long-term written contracts with its major suppliers and does not have any indication that any current suppliers will discontinue selling merchandise to them. The Company has not
experienced significant difficulty in maintaining satisfactory sources of supply, and management generally expects that adequate sources of supply will continue to exist for the types of merchandise
sold in the stores. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best
Buy's centralized marketing staff purchases substantially all store merchandise. The buying staff is responsible for product assortment, promotion planning and product pricing.
An inventory management staff is responsible for overall product acquisition and inventory management, including allocations and replenishment of store inventory. Except for certain entertainment
software, there are generally no agreements with suppliers for the return of unsold inventory. Merchandise remaining at the time of new product introduction is generally sold on a
close-out basis and may be subject to a reduction in selling price to levels at or below cost. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best
Buy has made product availability to consumers a high priority. Accordingly, the Company is increasing its investments in systems to assure that in-stock positions at
Best Buy's stores are among the highest in the industry. Best Buy uses an automatic replenishment system for restocking store inventories based on inventory levels, historical and projected sales
trends, promotions and seasonality. Best Buy uses an extensive merchandise planning and daily inventory monitoring system to manage inventory and increase inventory turns. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
fiscal 2001, the Company completed a new 700,000 square-foot distribution center in Dublin, Ga. Through the acquisition of Musicland, the Company also added a 715,000
square-foot distribution center in Franklin, Ind. The Company uses third-party distributors for fulfillment of a portion of the merchandise sold via the Company's Internet sites. The
majority of Best Buy's merchandise, except for major appliances, is shipped directly from manufacturers to a distribution center. In addition, Best Buy operates a dedicated distribution center for
entertainment software in Minnesota. Major appliances are shipped to satellite warehouses in each major market. In order to meet release dates for selected entertainment software titles and certain
computer products, and to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped directly to the stores from manufacturers and distributors. However, Best Buy is dependent upon the distribution
centers for inventory storage and shipment of most merchandise to its stores. Management believes that distribution centers can most effectively service Best Buy stores within a 600- to
700-mile radius and that its current distribution centers, including the new center mentioned above, will accommodate expansion plans for the next several years. The Company plans to
continue investing in new systems to reduce labor costs and improve accuracy in filling orders. </FONT></P>

purchases inventory for its stores directly from approximately 1,100 suppliers, exclusive of consignment arrangements. More than 60% of all purchases, net of returns, are
made from Musicland's 10 largest suppliers. Musicland does not have any long-term contracts with its suppliers and transacts business principally on an order-by-order basis as is typical throughout

majority of Musicland's inventory is shipped directly to its Fanklin, Ind. distribution center. Similar to Best Buy, Musicland uses an automatic replenishment system for restocking store inventories.
E-commerce product orders are also fulfilled at the Franklin distribution center. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Management Information Systems  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's management information systems provide daily information on the Company's sales, gross margins, and inventory levels by store and by stockkeeping
unit. These systems allow management to compare current performance against historical performance and the current year's budget. At the end of each day, the Company compiles sales information using
point-of-sale bar code scanning. The Company uses Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) with selected suppliers for the more efficient transmittal of purchase orders, shipping
notices and invoices. Management believes that the systems the Company has developed have the ability to continue to improve customer service, operational efficiency and management's ability to
monitor critical performance indicators. The Company continuously assesses its information systems needs to increase efficiency, improve decision-making and support growth. A major component of the
systems development plan for fiscal 2002 includes replacement of the Company's supply chain, financial and human resource systems. The Company is aware of the inherent risks associated with the
replacement of these core systems and believes it is taking appropriate action to reduce these risks. The Company expects to implement the replacement systems in a phased approach through fiscal 2003.
Additional systems initiatives for fiscal 2002 include
improvements in store systems, support for development of systems to support the retail store and e-commerce integration initiatives and continued support for the e-commerce
business. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Store Operations  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has developed a standardized and detailed system for operating Best Buy stores called Standard Operating Platform (SOP). The system includes
procedures for inventory management, transaction processing, customer relations, store administration, product sales and merchandise display. Best Buy store operations are organized into three
divisions. Each division is divided into regions and is under the supervision of a senior vice president who oversees store performance through regional managers, each of whom has responsibility for a
number of districts within the region. District managers monitor store operations closely and meet regularly with store managers to discuss SOP, merchandising, new product introductions, sales
promotions, customer loyalty programs, employee satisfaction surveys and store operating performance. Similar meetings are conducted at the corporate level with divisional and regional management. A
senior vice president of retail operations has overall responsibility for retail store processing and operations including labor management. Each district also has a loss prevention manager, with
product security personnel employed at each store to control inventory shrinkage. Best Buy controls advertising, pricing and inventory policies at corporate headquarters. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best
Buy stores are open seven days and six evenings a week. A store is typically staffed by one manager, four or five assistant managers and an average staff ranging from 65 to 150
people, depending on store size. Approximately 60% of a Best Buy store's staff, which includes product specialists and a support staff of cashiers and customer service and stock handling employees, is
employed on a part-time basis. Best Buy store managers are paid a salary and have the opportunity to earn bonuses if their stores exceed sales and gross margin goals, meet certain budget
criteria in controlling expenses and achieve certain administrative targets. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Best Buy employee development department provides managers with a variety of tools to teach employees the core skills they need to meet their performance objectives. In the
stores, Sales, Inventory, Operations and Merchandising managers undergo comprehensive training in their specialty areas, which include store operations, selling, managerial, training and
communications skills. The retail selling and sales support teams receive a thorough orientation to the industry and Best Buy business </FONT></P>

objectives. Sales personnel are trained to ask specific questions of customers to determine their needs and to present products, accessories and services that meet those expressed needs. Stores hold
quarterly team meetings to review store performance, focus, and changes and modifications in operating procedures. Best Buy also conducts specialized product training at these quarterly meetings. Best
Buy staffs store management positions with both personnel promoted from within the stores and those recruited from outside of Best Buy. In connection with expansion into new markets, Best Buy recruits
local management personnel who have valuable knowledge about the new market. The store
management development program is designed to help support the increased rate of store growth by developing and integrating new managers who have generally completed a year of training prior to
assuming full management responsibility. Continued investments in new technology support the Company's ongoing efforts to improve performance. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musicland
stores are operated independently from Best Buy stores. Sam Goody, Suncoast and On Cue stores are typically managed by a store manager and an assistant manager. Media Play
stores are typically managed by a general manager, an assistant general manager and three to five department managers. Most Musicland stores are open from 65 to 80&nbsp;hours per week, seven days a
week depending on mall hours. Store staffing levels fluctuate with the size of the store and anticipated sales volume. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magnolia
Hi-Fi stores are also operated independently from Best Buy stores. These stores are typically managed by a store manager, an audio/video sales manager and a
mobile electronics sales manager and one or more warehouse/receiving staff. Most Magnolia Hi-Fi stores are open approximately 70 to 75&nbsp;hours a week, seven days a week. Depending on an
individual store's volume, store staffing includes and additional 12 to 28 sales personnel and 2 to 10 mobile electronic installers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Credit Policy  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately one-third of Best Buy customer purchases are paid for by cash or check, with the remainder paid for by major credit cards or the Best
Buy private-label credit card. Best Buy uses special financing offers to stimulate sales. Generally, these financing offers allow customers to purchase certain products with repayment terms typically
ranging from 90&nbsp;days to 18&nbsp;months without a finance charge. The longer financing offers, generally those beyond six months, typically require minimum monthly payments to avoid the
finance charge. The special financing offers are provided only to customers who qualify for Best Buy's private-label credit card. The private-label credit card allows these customers to obtain
financing on purchases of merchandise at Best Buy stores through arrangements the Company has made with unaffiliated third-party institutions that have consumer credit programs. Best Buy is generally
able to qualify a new customer for credit on the spot, typically in less than five minutes. Best Buy sells receivables from private-label credit card sales, without recourse, to unaffiliated
third-party institutions. Best Buy receives payment from these institutions within three days following the sale. Sam Goody, Suncoast, On Cue and Media Play stores accept cash, checks and most major
credit cards with approximately 60% of customer transactions paid in cash or check. Magnolia Hi-Fi stores also accept cash, checks and most major credit cards with approximately 22% of
customer transactions paid in cash or check. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Competition  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's industry is highly competitive. Alternative channels of distribution such as the Internet and factory direct shopping services are expanding, and
mass merchandisers continue to increase their assortment of consumer electronics products&#151;primarily those that are less complex to sell, install and operate. Consumers are increasingly
downloading entertainment and computer software directly via the
Internet. Additionally, while many retail stores have exited the market, new competition is emerging as evidenced by the entrance of large home improvement retailers into the major appliance market.
The Company believes that its e-commerce initiatives, coupled with product knowledge, brand imaging, expertise and the services capabilities of the retail stores, will effectively position
the Company </FONT></P>

to meet the increased competition from e-commerce and mail-order retailers as well as mass merchandisers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More
effective advertising, a more customer-focused product assortment, improved product in-stock levels and better customer service have contributed to Best Buy market
share gains over the past year. The Company believes that Best Buy's store formats and brand positioning distinguishes Best Buy from most competitors by positioning the stores as the destination for
new technology and entertainment products in a fun, informative and no-pressure shopping environment. Best Buy competes by aggressively advertising and emphasizing a broad product
assortment, value pricing, financing alternatives and service. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company currently competes nationally against consumer electronics retailers such as Circuit City and RadioShack; computer superstores such as CompUSA; home office retailers such
as Office Depot, Office Max and Staples; mass merchants such as Sears, Wal-Mart and Target; home improvement superstores such as Home Depot and Lowes; entertainment software superstores
owned by Tower Records; boutiques such as Tweeter Home Entertainment Group and Ultimate Electronics; and a growing number of direct-to-consumer alternatives. The Company also
competes against independent dealers, regional chain discount stores, wholesale clubs, mail-order and Internet retailers, video rental stores and other specialty retail stores. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Employees  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of March&nbsp;3, 2001, the Company had approximately 75,000 employees, of whom approximately 42,000 were part-time or seasonal employees.
There are currently no collective bargaining agreements covering any of the Company's employees except that unions represent hourly employees at fourteen Musicland stores. The Company has not
experienced a strike or work stoppage, and management believes that its employee relations are good. </FONT></P>
