                                     PART I

Item 1.   Business.

      Air  T, Inc., incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1980
(the  "Company"), operates in three industry segments, providing  overnight  air
cargo  services  to the air express delivery industry through its  wholly  owned
subsidiaries,  Mountain  Air  Cargo, Inc. ("MAC") and  CSA  Air,  Inc.  ("CSA"),
aviation related parts brokerage and overhaul services through its wholly  owned
subsidiary, Mountain Aircraft Services, LLC ("MAS"), and aviation ground support
equipment  products through its wholly owned subsidiary, Global Ground  Support,
LLC  ("Global").   For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001  the  Company's  air
cargo  services  through MAC and CSA accounted for approximately  43.1%  of  the
Company's  consolidated  revenues,  aircraft  deice  and  other  ground  support
equipment  products through Global accounted for 44.7% of consolidated  revenues
and aviation related parts brokerage and overhaul services through MAS accounted
for  12.2%  of  consolidated revenues.  The Company's  air  cargo  services  are
provided  exclusively  to one customer -- Federal Express Corporation  ("Federal
Express").    Revenues  from  contracts  with  Federal  Express  accounted   for
approximately  43.1% of the Company's consolidated revenues for the  year  ended
March  31, 2001.  Certain financial data with respect to the Company's overnight
air cargo, aviation services and ground support equipment segments are set forth
in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II,
Item 8 of this report.  Such data are incorporated herein by reference.

      The  principal place of business of the Company and MAC is  Maiden,  North
Carolina;  the  principal  places  of business  of  CSA,  MAS  and  Global  are,
respectively,  Iron  Mountain, Michigan, Kinston,  North  Carolina  and  Olathe,
Kansas.

Diversification and Acquisition.

      In  October 1993, the Company organized MAS to diversify its customer base
and  business mix.  MAS provides aircraft maintenance, parts and other  aviation
related  services  to the commercial and military aviation industries.   MAS  is
organized  as  a  limited liability company, of which the Company  and  MAC  are
members  (99% of the profits and losses are allocated to the Company and  1%  to
MAC).

     In  August  1997, the Company organized Global to acquire the Simon  Deicer
Division  of Terex Aviation Ground Equipment, and the acquisition was  completed
that  month.   Global is located in Olathe, Kansas and manufactures,  sells  and
services  aircraft  ground support equipment sold to domestic and  international
passenger  and cargo airlines, as well as to airports.  During the  fiscal  year
ended  March 31, 2000, the Company diversified Global's product line to  include
additional  model  aircraft deicers and scissor-lift ground  support  equipment.
Global is organized as a limited liability company, of which the Company and MAS
are  members (99% of the profits and losses are allocated to MAS and 1%  to  the
Company).

     The  organization  of  MAS and Global reflects the  Company's  strategy  to
diversify  its operations within the aviation industry to reduce its  dependence
on the air cargo service segment.

Overnight Air Cargo Services.

      MAC  and CSA provide small package overnight air freight delivery services
on a contract basis throughout the eastern half of the United States and Canada,
and  in  Puerto  Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  MAC and CSA's  revenues  are
derived  principally pursuant to "dry-lease" service contracts.  Under the  dry-
lease service contracts, the customer leases its aircraft to MAC (or CSA) for  a
nominal  amount  and pays an administrative fee to MAC (or  CSA).   Under  these
arrangements,  all  direct  costs  related to  the  operation  of  the  aircraft
(including  fuel, maintenance, landing fees and pilot costs) are passed  through
to  the  customer.  For the most recent fiscal year, operations under  dry-lease
service  contracts accounted for 98.0% of MAC and CSA's revenues (42.2%  of  the
Company's consolidated revenues).

     For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, MAC and CSA provided air delivery
service  exclusively  to Federal Express.  As of March 31,  2001,  MAC  and  CSA
operated  an  aggregate  of 95 aircraft under agreements with  Federal  Express.
Separate  agreements cover the three types of aircraft operated by MAC  and  CSA
for  Federal  Express -- Cessna Caravan, Fokker F-27 and Short Brothers  SD3-30.
Cessna Caravan and Fokker F-27 aircraft are dry-leased from Federal Express, and
Short Brothers SD3-30 aircraft are owned by the Company and operated under "wet-
lease"  arrangements  with Federal Express which provide for  a  fixed  fee  per
flight  regardless of the amount of cargo carried.  Pursuant to such agreements,
Federal Express determines the schedule of routes to be flown by MAC and CSA.

      Agreements  with  Federal  Express  are  renewable  annually  and  may  be
terminated by Federal Express any time upon 15 to 30 days' notice.  The  Company
believes that the short term and other provisions of its agreements with Federal
Express  are standard within the air freight contract delivery service industry.
Loss  of  Federal Express as a customer would have a material adverse effect  on
MAC, CSA and the Company.

      MAC  and  CSA  operate  under separate aviation  certifications.   MAC  is
certified to operate under Part 121, Part 135 and Part 145 of the regulations of
the  Federal  Aviation Administration (the "FAA").  These certifications  permit
MAC  to  operate  and maintain aircraft that can carry up to  18,000  pounds  of
cargo and provide maintenance services to third party operators.  CSA is certi-
fied to operate under Part 135 of the FAA regulations.  This certification
permits CSA to operate aircraft with a maximum cargo  capacity  of 7,500 pounds.

      MAC and CSA, together, operated or held for sale the following aircraft as
of March 31, 2001:

                                                      Form of    Number of
      Type of Aircraft                 Model Year    Ownership    Aircraft

      Cessna Caravan, 208A and 208B
       (single turbo prop)             1985-1996     dry lease      73

      Fokker F-27 (twin turbo prop)    1968-1981     dry lease      20

      Short Brothers SD3-30
       (twin turbo prop)                 1981        owned           2

      Total                                                         95

     Of  the 95 aircraft fleet, 93 aircraft (the Cessna Caravan and Fokker  F-27
aircraft)  are owned by Federal Express.  Under the dry-lease service contracts,
certain  maintenance expense, including cost of parts inventory, and maintenance
performed  by personnel not employed by the Company, is passed directly  to  the
customer,  and  the expense of daily, routine maintenance and  aircraft  service
checks  is charged to the customer on an hourly basis.  Accordingly, the Company
does  not  anticipate  maintenance expense, such  as  engine  overhauls,  to  be
material to the Company's operating results.

      All  FAA Part 135 aircraft, including Cessna Caravan models 208A and 208B,
and  Short  Brothers  SD3-30 aircraft are maintained on FAA approved  inspection
programs.   The inspection intervals range from 100 to 200 hours.   The  engines
are  produced by Pratt & Whitney, and overhaul periods are based on FAA approved
schedules.   The current overhaul period on the Cessna aircraft is 7,500  hours.
The  Short  Brothers manufactured aircraft are maintained on an  "on  condition"
maintenance  program  (i.e., maintenance is performed when performance  deviates
from  certain  specifications) with engine inspections at each phase  inspection
and in-shop maintenance at predetermined intervals.

      The  Fokker  F-27 aircraft are maintained under a FAA Part 121 maintenance
program.   The program consists of A, B, C, D and I service checks.  The  engine
overhaul period is 6,700 hours.

     In May 2000, MAC completed its FAA certification to commence operation of a
Part 145 maintenance facility at its Kinston, N.C. location.  MAC's future plans
include the ability to perform heavy maintenance for regional/trunk FAA Part 121
certified carriers.

      The  Company  operates  in highly competitive markets  and  competes  with
approximately  50 other contract cargo carriers in the United States.   MAC  and
CSA's  contracts are renewed on an annual basis.  Accurate industry data is  not
available  to indicate the Company's position within its marketplace  (in  large
measure  because  most  of the Company's competitors are  privately  held),  but
management  believes that MAC and CSA, combined, constitute one of  the  largest
contract carriers of the type described immediately above.

     The Company's air cargo operations are not materially seasonal.

Aircraft Deice and Other Equipment Products.

      In  August 1997, the Company organized Global to acquire the Simon  Deicer
Division  of Terex Aviation Ground Equipment to further diversify the  Company's
customer   base   and  business  mix  within  the  aviation  industry.    Global
manufactures,  sells,  services and supports aircraft  devices  on  a  worldwide
basis.   During  the  fiscal year ended March 31, 2000, the Company  diversified
Global's  product  line  to include additional models of  aircraft  deicers  and
scissor-lift ground support equipment.  Global's primary customers are passenger
and cargo  airlines, the U.S. Airforce, as well as airports located in the
United States and in international markets.  Global's operations are located in
Olathe, Kansas.

      In  the  manufacture  of  its ground service equipment,  Global  assembles
components  acquired  from  third  party  suppliers.   Components  are   readily
available from a number of different suppliers.  The primary components are  the
chassis (which is similar to the chassis of a medium to heavy truck) and heating
equipment.

      Global  manufactures five basic models of mobile deicing equipment ranging
from  700 to 3,200 gallon capacity models in addition to fixed pedestal  mounted
deicers.   Each model can be customized as requested by the customer,  including
the  addition  of  twin  engine  deicing systems,  fire  suppressant  equipment,
modifications  for  open or enclosed cab design, a recently patented  forced-air
deicing nozzle to substantially reduce glycol usage and color and style  of  the
exterior   finish.   Global  also  manufactures  three  models  of  scissor-lift
equipment, for catering, cabin service and maintenance service of aircraft.
Global  competes  primarily on the basis of reliability of  its  products,
prompt delivery and price.  The market for aviation ground service equipment  is
highly  competitive.

      Global's  mobile deicing equipment business has historically  been  highly
seasonal, with the bulk of deicing equipment being purchased by customers in the
late  summer and fall in preparation for winter months.  Historically, the  bulk
of  Global's revenues have occurred during the second and third fiscal quarters,
and comparatively little revenue has occurred during the first and fourth fiscal
quarters.  The Company has reduced Global's seasonal fluctuation in revenues  by
the  introduction of a line of non-deicer related ground support equipment,  the
January  2000 commencement of a long-term contract to provide deicing  equipment
to  the  U.S.  Air Force and the recent award of a $7.1 million pedestal-mounted
deicer  contract with the Philadelphia International Airport, expected  to  be
completed in the third quarter of the current fiscal year.

      Revenue  from  Global's  contract with the  U.S.  Air  Force  accounted
for approximately  13.9% of the Company's consolidated revenue for  the
year  ended March 31, 2001.

Aviation Related Parts Brokerage and Overhaul Services.

      In  October 1993, the Company organized MAS to diversify its customer base
and  business  mix.   MAS  provides aircraft maintenance  and  parts  and  other
aviation  related  services to the commercial and military aviation  industries.
MAS's  principal  offices and primary overhaul facilities  are  located  at  the
Global TransPark in Kinston, North Carolina and Miami, Florida.

      Services  offered  by  MAS  include engine overhaul  management,  aircraft
maintenance and component repair.  Services are provided under standard purchase
contracts.

      In  addition, MAS sells aircraft parts, of which approximately 1%  of  the
amount sold in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001 were used in connection with
maintenance  performed by MAS.  Sales of parts by MAS do not include  any  parts
purchased for maintenance of aircraft operated by MAC or CSA.

      MAS's  inventory of parts held for sale was approximately $5.3 million  at
March  31,  2001 and included parts for use in primarily 15 types of  commercial
and military aircraft, all of which are generally in current use.  MAS maintains
its   own  inventory  controls  and  documentation,  sets  stocking  levels  and
determines the conditions for surplus parts disposal.

      MAS's  customers  include the commercial air cargo and passenger  aviation
industries  and manufacturers of commercial and military aircraft  and  contract
maintenance  companies  serving the commercial and military  aviation  industry.
MAS  also  provides  parts or services under contracts directly  with  the  U.S.
government.  For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, MAS provided services  or
parts to over 75 customers, with five customers accounting for approximately 95%
of MAS's revenues for the year.

     MAS's operations are not materially seasonal.


Backlog.

     The  Company's  backlog  consists of "firm" orders  supported  by  customer
purchase  orders  with fixed delivery dates for the deicing  equipment  sold  by
Global  and  for  parts  and equipment sold by MAS.   At  March  31,  2001,  the
Company's  backlog  of  orders was $20.6 million, of  which  $19.5  million  was
attributable to Global and approximately $1.1 million was attributable  to  MAS,
all of which the Company expects to be filled in the current fiscal year.

Governmental Regulation.

      Under  the  Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, the FAA  has  safety
jurisdiction  over  flight  operations generally,  including  flight  equipment,
flight  and  ground  personnel training, examination and certification,  certain
ground   facilities,  flight  equipment  maintenance  programs  and  procedures,
examination  and certification of mechanics, flight routes, air traffic  control
and  communications  and other matters.  The FAA also has power  to  suspend  or
revoke  for  cause the certificates it issues and to institute  proceedings  for
imposition   and  collection   of  fines  for  violation  of  federal   aviation
regulations.   The  Company has secured appropriate operating  certificates  and
airworthiness certificates for all aircraft operated by it.

      The  FAA  periodically conducts routine reviews of MAC and CSA's operating
procedures and flight and maintenance records.

      The  Airline  Deregulation Act of 1978 created a  new  class  of  domestic
certificated  all-cargo  carriers.  Pursuant to such  certificate,  aircraft  of
specified size may be operated within the United States, without restriction  on
routes.

      The  Company has been subject to FAA regulation since the commencement  of
its business activities.  The FAA is concerned with safety and the regulation of
flight  operations  generally,  including  equipment  used,  ground  facilities,
maintenance,  communications and other matters.  The FAA can suspend  or  revoke
the  authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply
with  its  regulations  and  can ground aircraft if questions  arise  concerning
airworthiness.   The  Company,  through its subsidiaries,  holds  all  operating
airworthiness  and other FAA certificates that are currently  required  for  the
conduct of its business, although these certificates may be suspended or revoked
for cause.

      The FAA has authority under the Noise Control Act of 1972, as amended,  to
monitor  and  regulate  aircraft engine noise.  The  aircraft  operated  by  the
Company  are  in compliance with all such regulations promulgated  by  the  FAA.
Moreover,  because the Company does not operate jet aircraft,  noncompliance  is
not  likely.   Such  aircraft also comply with standards  for  aircraft  exhaust
emissions  promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency  pursuant  to  the
Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended.

     Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in
its  aircraft  operations, the Company is subject to the Federal  Communications
Act of 1934, as amended.

Maintenance and Insurance.

      The  Company, through its subsidiaries, maintains its aircraft  under  the
appropriate FAA standards and regulations.

      The Company has secured public liability and property damage insurance  in
excess  of  minimum  amounts  required  by  the  United  States  Department   of
Transportation.   The  Company  has also obtained  all-risk  hull  insurance  on
Company-owned aircraft.

      The  Company  maintains cargo liability insurance,  workers'  compensation
insurance and fire and extended coverage insurance, for leased as well as  owned
facilities and equipment.

Employees.

      At  June  5, 2001, the Company and its subsidiaries had 472 full-time  and
full-time-equivalent employees, of which 9 are employed by the Company, 292  are
employed  by  MAC, 60 are employed by CSA, 31 are employed by  MAS  and  80  are
employed by Global.  None of the Company's employees are represented by a union.
The Company believes its relations with its employees are good.

Item 2.   Properties.

      The  Company leases the Little Mountain Airport in Maiden, North  Carolina
from  a corporation whose stock is owned in part by J. Hugh Bingham, William  H.
Simpson  and  John  J. Gioffre, officers and directors of the Company,  and  the
estate of David Clark, of which, Walter Clark, the Company's chairman and  Chief
Executive  Officer,  is  a co-executor and beneficiary,  and  Allison  Clark,  a
director,  is  a beneficiary.  The facility consists of approximately  65  acres
with  one  3,000 foot paved runway, approximately 20,000 square feet  of  hangar
space  and approximately 10,300 square feet of office space.  The operations  of
the  Company  and MAC are headquartered at this facility.  The  lease  for  this
facility was renewed in May 1996, expired on May 31, 2001.  Subsequent to  year-
end  the  lease was renewed through May 31, 2006, and the monthly lease  payment
was increased to $9,147 from $8,073.

      The Company also leases approximately 800 square feet of office space  and
approximately  6,000  square feet of hangar space at the Ford  Airport  in  Iron
Mountain,  Michigan.   CSA's operations are headquartered at  these  facilities.
These  facilities  are leased, from a third party, under an  annually  renewable
agreement  with a monthly rental payment, as of March 31, 2001, of approximately
$1,698.

     On November 16, 1995, the Company entered into a twenty-one and a half year
premises  and facilities lease with Global TransPark Foundation, Inc.  to  lease
approximately  53,000  square feet of a new 66,000 square foot  aircraft  hangar
shop  and  office  facility at the North Carolina Global TransPark  in  Kinston,
North Carolina.  On August 10, 1996, MAS's component repair services and part of
MAC's  aircraft  maintenance operations were relocated to this  facility.   Rent
under  this lease increases over time as follows:  the first 18 months, no rent;
the next 5-year period, $2.25 per square foot; the next 5-year period, $3.50 per
square foot; the next 5-year period, $4.50 per square foot; and the final 5-year
period,  $5.90  per  square  foot.   This  lease  is  cancelable  under  certain
conditions  at  the  Company's option.  The Company  began  operations  at  this
facility in August 1996.

      MAS  operates  an engine overhaul management facility in  Miami,  Florida,
leasing, from a third party, approximately 4,700 square feet of shop space.  The
lease expires in March 31, 2002, and the monthly rental payment is $3,118.   MAS
also  operates  a  145  inventory repair shop facility in  Kinston.   The  lease
expires in March 31, 2002 and the monthly rental payment is $5,941.

      Global leases a 112,500 square foot production facility in Olathe, Kansas.
The  facility is leased, from a third party, under a three-year lease  agreement
which expires in August 2001.  The monthly rental payment, as of March 31, 2001,
was $35,903.  In April 2001 the lease was renewed through August 2006, monthly
rental will increase from $28,967 to $30,842 over the life of the lease.

     As of March 31, 2001, the Company leased hangar space from third parties at
35  other  locations for aircraft storage.  Such hangar space  is  leased,  from
third parties, at prevailing market terms.

      The  table of aircraft presented in Item 1 lists the aircraft operated  by
the Company's subsidiaries and the form of ownership.

Item 3.   Legal Proceedings.

      The Company is currently aware of certain employee, product liability  and
environmental matters, some of which involve pending or threatened lawsuits.  If
adversely  decided,  management  believes  the  results  of  these  pending   or
threatened lawsuits would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Item 4.   Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

      No  matter  was  submitted during the fourth quarter of  the  fiscal  year
covered by this report to a vote of security holders.

Item  7.    Management's  Discussion and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and
Results of Operations

Overview

     The  Company's two most significant components of revenue, which  accounted
for  43.1%  and 44.7% of revenue, respectively, were generated through  its  air
cargo  subsidiaries,  Mountain Air Cargo, Inc. (MAC) and CSA  Air,  Inc.  (CSA),
which are short-haul express air freight carriers flying nightly contracts for a
major  express  delivery  company out of 80 cities, principally  located  in  30
states  in the eastern half of the United States and in Puerto Rico, Canada  and
the  Virgin  Islands and its ground support equipment subsidiary, Global  Ground
Support, LLC (Global).  Global manufactures, sells and services aircraft deicers
and other ground support equipment.

      Separate agreements cover the three types of aircraft operated by MAC  and
CSA-Cessna Caravan, Fokker F-27, and Short Brothers SD3-30.  Cessna Caravan  and
Fokker F-27 aircraft (a total of 93 aircraft at March 31, 2001) are owned by and
dry-leased from a major air express company (Customer), and Short Brothers  SD3-
30  aircraft  (two  aircraft at March 31, 2001) are owned  by  the  Company  and
operated  under  wet-lease  arrangements with the Customer.   Pursuant  to  such
agreements, the Customer determines the type of aircraft and schedule of  routes
to  be  flown by MAC and CSA, with all other operational decisions made  by  the
Company.   Under the terms of the dry-lease service agreements, which  currently
cover  approximately 98% of the revenue aircraft operated,  the  Company  passes
through  to  its  customer  certain cost components of  its  operations  without
markup.   The  cost  of  fuel, flight crews, landing fees, outside  maintenance,
parts  and  certain  other  direct operating costs  are  included  in  operating
expenses and billed to the customer as cargo and maintenance revenue, at cost.

      Agreements are renewable annually and may be terminated by the Customer at
any  time upon 15 to 30 days' notice.  The Company believes that the short  term
and other provisions of its agreements with the Customer are standard within the
air   freight   contract  delivery  service  industry.   The  Company   is   not
contractually  precluded from providing such services to other  firms,  and  has
done  so  in  the  past. Loss of its contracts with the Customer  would  have  a
material adverse effect on the Company.

      Mountain Aircraft Services, LLC's (MAS) aircraft component repair services
contributed approximately $8,578,000 and $9,169,000 to the Company's revenues in
fiscal  2001  and 2000, respectively, and are included in Aircraft Services  and
Other in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings.

      Global  Ground Support, LLC (Global), manufactures, services and  supports
aircraft  deicers  and  other ground support equipment  on  a  worldwide  basis.
Global  is  operated  as  a  subsidiary of MAS.   Global's  revenue  contributed
approximately  $31,406,000 and $17,009,000 to the Company's revenues  in  fiscal
2001  and 2000, respectively.  The significant increase in revenues in 2001  was
primarily  related to the June 1999 award of a four-year, $25,000,000 contract
to  supply deicing  equipment to the United States Air Force.  The Company was
subsequently made aware that a competing bidder had filed a protest opposing the
awarding  of the  contract  to  Global.   In  September 1999 the  General
Accounting  Office finalized  the  denial of the protest and upheld the awarding
of the  Air  Force contract to Global.  As a result of the delays created by
this protest,  revenue originally anticipated to commence during the quarter
ending December  31,  1999 was delayed until the quarter ending March 31, 2000.
Additionally, the protest and  its  resulting  delay  caused Global to incur
substantial  legal  fees  and additional  overhead costs relating to fixed
production costs which  would  have been  absorbed by operations but were
reallocated to other product lines  during fiscal 2000 resulting in lower
margins in the existing product lines.

      The  Company's four subsidiaries operate in three business segments.  Each
business  segment has separate management teams and infrastructures  that  offer
different products and services.  The subsidiaries have been combined  into  the
following reportable segments: air cargo, aviation services and aviation  ground
equipment.

      The  accounting policies for all reportable segments are the same as those
described in Footnote 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The  Company evaluates the performance of its  operating  segments based on
operating income.





      The  following  table summarizes the changes and trends in  the  Company's
expenses as a percentage of revenue:

                                         Fiscal Year Ended March 31,

Total  costs and expenses                96.41%      98.35%     98.19%


Seasonality

     Global's business has historically been highly seasonal.  Due to the nature
of  its  product line, the bulk of Global's revenues and earnings have typically
occurred  during  the  second and third fiscal quarters in anticipation  of  the
winter season, and comparatively little has occurred during the first and fourth
fiscal quarters.  The Company has continued its efforts, started in fiscal 1999,
to  reduce  Global's seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by broadening
its  product  line  to increase revenues and earnings in the  first  and  fourth
fiscal  quarters.  The Company expended exceptional effort in  fiscal  1999  and
2000  to  design and produce prototype equipment to expand its product  line  to
include additional deicer models and three models of scissor-lift equipment  for
catering,  cabin service and maintenance service of aircraft.  These costs  were
expensed  as incurred.  As indicated above, in June 1999, Global was  awarded  a
four-year  contract to supply deicing equipment to the United States  Air  Force
for  a  total  amount of approximately $25 million, and in January  2001  Global
received  a  $7.1 million pedestal-mounted deicer contract with the Philadelphia
International  Airport,  expected to be completed in the  third  quarter  of
fiscal 2002.  The Company anticipates that revenue from these contracts
will contribute to management's plan to reduce Global's seasonal fluctuation  in
revenues. The remainder of the Company's business is not materially seasonal.

Results of Operations

     Fiscal 2001 vs. 2000

      Consolidated revenue increased $11,400,000 (19.4%) to $70,246,000 for  the
fiscal  year  ended  March  31, 2001 compared to the  prior  fiscal  year.   The
increase  in  2001  revenue primarily resulted from increases  in  revenue  from
Global  of  $14,397,000 (84.6%) to $31,406,000 partially offset by decreases  in
MAS revenue of $591,000 (6.4%) to $8,578,000 and a $2,405,000 (7.4%) decrease in
air cargo revenue to $30,262,000.

      Operating expenses increased $9,857,000 (17.0%) to $67,729,000 for  fiscal
2001  compared to fiscal 2000.  The net increase in operating expenses consisted
of  the following changes: cost of flight operations increased $1,248,000 (9.1%)
as  a result of increases in fuel, landing fees, pilot and flight personnel  and
costs associated with pilot travel; maintenance and brokerage expenses decreased
$3,755,000  (18.2%) primarily as a result of decreases associated with  cost  of
parts stock purchases and labor related to the decreased revenue of MAS's repair
facility  and by lower outside maintenance costs at MAC; ground equipment  costs
increased  $11,244,000  (74.7%),  as a result  of  increased  sales  at  Global;
depreciation and amortization decreased $96,000 (10.4%) as a result  of  certain
assets  becoming  fully  depreciated, or written off  during  fiscal  2001;  the
general  and administrative expense increase of $1,217,000 (16.2%) is  primarily
the  result of  increases in general wages and benefits, professional  fees  and
staff expense.

     On a segment basis, the most significant impacts on the Company's operating
results  comparing  the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001  to  the  prior  period
resulted  from  changes  in  parent  company revenue  and  expense,  the  ground
equipment  operation  at  Global and the aircraft  services  operation  at  MAS.
Current  year  corporate  operating loss increased  $420,000  due  to  increased
general  and administrative expense over the prior year and decreased investment
income.  In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, Global had an operating income
of  $2,049,000  compared  to a prior period loss of $591,000, MAS had
operating  income of $274,000 compared to $650,000 in  the  prior  year.
Several  factors  contributed  to the changes in Global's  and  MAS's  operating
results.  Global's current fiscal year revenue increased 84.6% compared  to  its
prior fiscal year primarily due to commencement of the U.S. Air Force contract.
MAS's  current fiscal year revenue decreased 6.4% compared to its  prior  fiscal
year revenue. The decrease in MAS revenue, and operating income, was primarily
due to decreased brokerage sales and parts overhaul revenue.  Operating income
for the Company's overnight air cargo operations was $2,476,000 in the fiscal
year ended March  31,  2001, a decrease of 7.6% from $2,680,000 in the prior
fiscal  year.  The MAC decrease resulted from decreased levels of aircraft
maintenance.

      Non-operating  expense increased a net $225,000 due to  increased  current
year  interest  expense related to higher levels of borrowing on  the  Company's
line  of credit to fund the expanded operations of Global and MAS and a decrease
in investment income.

      Provision  for income taxes increased $390,000 (146.9%) due  to  increased
taxable income.  The provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended March
31,  2001, 2000 and 1999 were different from the Federal statutory rates due  to
state  tax  provisions  and a reduction in the Company's excise tax accrual
due to a favorable tax ruling.

    Fiscal 2000 vs. 1999

      Consolidated revenue increased $6,726,000 (12.9%) to $58,846,000  for  the
fiscal  year  ended  March  31, 2000 compared to the  prior  fiscal  year.   The
increase  in 2000 revenue primarily resulted from increases in revenue from  MAS
of  $3,878,000  (73.3%) to $9,169,000 and an increase at  Global  of  $3,614,000
(27.0%)  to  $17,009,000,  partly offset by a $723,000  decrease  in  air  cargo
revenue.

      Operating expenses increased $6,698,000 (13.1%) to $57,872,000 for  fiscal
2000  compared to fiscal 1999.  The net increase in operating expenses consisted
of the following changes: cost of flight operations decreased $459,000 (3.2%) as
a  result  of decreases in pilot and flight personnel and costs associated  with
pilot  travel;  maintenance and brokerage expenses increased $3,005,000  (17.0%)
primarily  as  a  result of increases associated with cost of  parts  and  labor
related  to  the  expansion of MAS's repair facility offset  in  part  by  lower
outside  maintenance costs; ground equipment costs increased $3,571,000 (31.1%),
as  a  result  of  increased  sales  at Global;  depreciation  and  amortization
increased  $273,000 (42.1%) as a result additional depreciable  assets  acquired
throughout  the  Company's  operations  during  fiscal  2000;  the  general  and
administrative expense increase of $309,000 (4.3%) is primarily  the  result  of
costs  associated  with  the  expansion of  MAS's  repair  shop  operations  and
increases in general wages and benefits, professional fees and staff expense.

     On a segment basis, the most significant impacts on the Company's operating
results  comparing  the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000  to  the  prior  period
resulted  from  changes  in  parent  company revenue  and  expense,  the  ground
equipment  operation  at  Global and the aircraft  services  operation  at  MAS.
The corporate operating loss for the fiscal year-ended  March  31,
2000  increased $622,000 due to the elimination of aircraft rental  revenue  and
increased  general and administrative and depreciation expense  over  the  prior
year.  In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000, Global had an operating loss  of
$591,000  compared  to  a  prior  period loss of  $498,000, MAS had
operating income of $650,000 compared to an operating loss of $79,000  in
the  prior  year.   Several factors contributed to the changes in  Global's  and
MAS's  operating results.  Although Global's revenue for the fiscal  year  ended
March 31, 2000 was  27.0% greater than revenue for the prior fiscal year, unused
productive  capacity  and legal cost associated with the protest  and  delay  in
finalizing the Air Force contract and higher than normal production, engineering
and  design  cost  associated with the introduction of new  products  caused  an
increase  in  Global's current period loss.  MAS's current fiscal  year  revenue
increased 73.3% compared to its prior fiscal year.  The increase in revenue, and
operating income, was primarily due to increased brokerage sales and revenue and
income  generated by the expansion of aircraft component repair service  offered
by MAS's 145 repair facility located in Kinston, N.C.

     Operating  income  for  the Company's overnight air  cargo  operations  was
$2,680,000  in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000, up 0.5% from $2,666,000  in
the prior fiscal year.

      Non-operating  expense increased a net $307,000 due to  increased  current
year  interest  expense related to higher levels of borrowing on  the  Company's
line of credit to fund the expanded operations of Global and MAS.

      Provision  for  income taxes decreased $118,000 (30.8%) due  to  decreased
taxable income.  The provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended March
31,  2000 and 1999 were different from the Federal statutory rates due to  state
tax provisions.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

     As of March 31, 2001 the Company's working capital amounted to $12,249,000,
an  increase  of  $5,673,000  compared to March  31,  2000.   The  net  increase
primarily resulted from changes made to the payment terms of the Company's  line
of  credit  which  transferred  $5,162,000  from  notes  payable  to  long  term
obligations.

     On  May  31,  2001  the  Company expanded its  bank  financing  line  to  a
$10,000,000  credit  facility.  Under the terms of the agreement,  a  $7,000,000
secured  long-term  revolving  credit line which  expires  on  August  31,  2002
replaced the Company's existing $8,500,000 unsecured short-term revolving credit
line  which was due to expire in August 2001.  The remaining $3,000,000  of  the
credit  facility was set up as a five-year term loan which expires  on  May  31,
2006  and is scheduled to be repaid in quarterly principal payments of $150,000,
plus accrued interest.

     The  credit  facility contains customary events of default and  restrictive
covenants  that,  among other matters, require the Company to  maintain  certain
financial ratios.  As of March 31 2001, the Company was in compliance  with  all
of  the  restrictive covenants.  The amount of credit available to  the  Company
under  the  agreement  at  any  given  time is  determined  by  an  availability
calculation,  based  on the eligible borrowing base, as defined  in  the  credit
agreement, which includes the Company's outstanding receivables, inventories and
equipment,  with  certain  exclusions.   The  credit  facility  is  secured   by
substantially all of the Company's assets.

     Amounts  advanced  under the credit facility bear interest  at  the  30-day
"LIBOR" rate plus 137 basis points.  The LIBOR rate at March 31, 2001 was 5.28%.
At  March  31,  2001  and 2000, the amounts outstanding against  the  line  were
$5,763,000  and  $3,988,000, respectively.  At March 31,  2001,  $2,737,000  was
available under the entire credit facility.

      The  Company has classified $5,162,000 of its outstanding balance on the
credit line as of  March  31, 2001 as long-term to reflect the terms included
under the agreement signed on May 31,  2001.  The  Company also entered into a
swap agreement on May 31, 2001 to fix the  interest rate  on the $3,000,000 term
portion and $2,000,000 of the revolving portion of the credit facility at
respective interest rates of 6.97% and 6.50%.

      The  respective years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 resulted in  the
following  changes  in  cash  flow:  operating  activities  used  $1,129,000
and $1,531,000,  respectively  in  2001 and 1999  and  provided  $262,000  in
2000.  Investing  activities  used $227,000, $172,000, and $733,000,  respect-
ively,  in 2001, 2000 and 1999 and financing activities provided $1,310,000 and
$2,533,000, respectively,  in 2001 and 1999 and used $209,000 in 2000.  Net
cash  decreased $47,000  and $119,000, respectively, in 2001 and 2000 and
increased $69,000  for 1999.

      Cash  used  in operating activities was $1,392,000 more for the year ended
March 31, 2001 compared to 2000 principally due to increases in accounts receiv-
able and inventory partially  offset  by  increases in net earnings and accrued
expenses.  Cash used in investing activities for the  year ended March 31, 2001
was approximately $55,000 more than 2000, principally due to  increased capital
expenditures.  Cash provided by financing activities  was $1,519,000  more  in
2001 compared to 2000 principally due  to  an  increase in proceeds relating to
borrowings under the line of credit.

      During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001 the Company repurchased 61,200
shares  of  its  common  stock at a total cost of  $186,783.   Pursuant  to  its
previously  announced stock repurchase program, $189,919 remains  available  for
repurchase of common stock.

      There  are  currently no commitments for significant capital expenditures.
The  Company's Board of Directors, on August 7, 1997, adopted the policy to  pay
an  annual cash dividend in the first quarter of each fiscal year, in an  amount
to be determined by the board.  The Company paid a $0.10 per share cash dividend
in  June  2000  and declared a $0.15 per share cash dividend on  May  10,  2001,
paid on June 13, 2001 to shareholders of record dated May 29, 2001.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

      In  June  1998,  the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")  issued
Statement  of  Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, ("SFAS 133")  "Accounting
for   Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities",  which  requires   all
derivative  instruments  to be recognized on the balance  sheet  at  their  fair
value.   Changes in the fair value of derivatives are to be recorded each period
either in other comprehensive income or in current earnings depending on the use
of  the derivatives and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.  SFAS No. 133
was  effective for the Company beginning on April 1, 2001.  The adoption of SFAS
No. 133 did not significantly impact the  Company's financial statements.


Impact of Inflation

      The  Company believes that due to the current low levels of inflation  the
impact  of  inflation and changing prices on its revenues and net earnings  will
not  have a material effect on its manufacturing operations, or on its air cargo
business   since  the  major  cost  components  of  its  operations,  consisting
principally of fuel, crew and certain maintenance costs are reimbursed,  without
markup, under current contract terms.


Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

     The  Company  does not hold or issue derivative financial  instruments  for
trading  purposes.  On May 31, 2001 the Company entered into swap agreements  to
fix the  interest  rates  on  the $3 million term portion  and  $2  million  of
the revolving portion of its credit facility at respective interest rates of
6.97% and  6.50%  to  reduce its exposure to the fluctuations of LIBOR-based
variable interest rates.  The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates on
certain portions  of its line of credit, which bears interest based on the
30-day  LIBOR rate plus 137 basis points.  If the LIBOR interest rate had been
increased  by one  percentage  point, based on the year-end balance of  the
line of credit, annual interest expense would have increased by approximately
$58,000.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



Board of Directors and Stockholders
Air T, Inc.
Denver, North Carolina

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Air T, Inc. and
subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our respons-
ibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Air T, Inc. as of March 31, 2001
and 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended March 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

                          AIR T, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001, 2000, AND 1999

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Principal  Business  Activities - The Company,  through  its  operating
     subsidiaries,  is  an  air  cargo  carrier specializing  in  the  overnight
     delivery of small package air freight, a provider of aircraft parts, engine
     overhaul  management and component repair services and  a  manufacturer  of
     aircraft ground service equipment.

     Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include
     the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Mountain Air
     Cargo,  Inc.,  CSA Air, Inc., Mountain Aircraft Services,  LLC  and  Global
     Ground  Support,  LLC.   All  significant  intercompany  transactions   and
     balances have been eliminated.

     Concentration  of  Credit  Risk  -  The Company's  potential  exposure  to
     concentrations  of  credit  risk  consists of  trade  accounts  receivable.
     Accounts  receivable  are  normally due within  30  days  and  the  Company
     performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition.

     Substantially  all  of  the Company's customers  are  concentrated  in  the
     aviation  industry  and  revenue  can be  materially  affected  by  current
     economic  conditions and the price of certain supplies such as  fuel, the
     cost of which is passed through to the customer.   The Company has customer
     concentrations in two areas of operations, air  cargo which  provides
     service to one major customer and aviation parts and repair service which
     provides service to approximately 75 customers, five of which are
     considered major customers.  The loss of a major customer would have  a
     material impact on the Company's results of operations.

     Cash  Equivalents   - Cash equivalents consist of liquid  investments  with
     maturities of three months or less when purchased.

     Marketable Securities - Marketable  securities  consists primarily of
     individual  stocks, bonds, mutual  funds  and  certificates of deposit.
     The  Company  has  classified marketable  securities as available-for-sale
     and they are carried  at  fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses on such
     securities  are excluded from earnings  and  reported  as  a  separate
     component of stockholders' equity until  realized.  Realized gains and
     losses  on marketable securities  are  determined  by  calculating the
     difference  between the basis of each   specifically identified market-
     able security sold and its sales price.

     Inventories  - Inventories of the manufacturing subsidiary are  carried  at
     the  lower  of  cost (first in, first out) or market.  Parts  and  supplies
     inventory  are carried at the lower of average cost or market.   Consistent
     with industry practice, the Company includes aircraft parts and supplies in
     current assets, although a certain portion of these inventories may not  be
     used within one year.

     Property and Equipment - Property and equipment is stated at cost or, in
     the  case  of equipment under capital leases, the present value  of  future
     lease  payments.   Rotables inventory represents aircraft parts  which  are
     repairable, capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful  lives.
     Depreciation  and amortization are provided on a straight-line  basis  over
     the asset's service life or related lease term, as follows:

                 Flight equipment and intellectual property          7 years
                 Other equipment and furniture                  3 to 7 years

     Revenue Recognition  - Cargo revenue is recognized upon completion of
     contract  terms and maintenance revenue is recognized when the service  has
     been  performed.   Revenue from product sales is recognized  when  contract
     terms  are  completed  and  title has passed to customers.   Revenues  from
     overhaul  contracts  on  customer owned parts and  long  term  fixed  price
     manufacturing  projects  are  recognized  on  the  percentage-of-completion
     method,  in  accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 81-1,  "Accounting
     for   Performance   of  Construction  Type  and  Certain  Production   Type
     Contracts", as a result of a significant increase in overhaul contracts  in
     fiscal  2000.  Prior to 2000 such contracts were immaterial.  Revenues  for
     contracts under percentage of completion are measured by the percentage  of
     cost  incurred to date, if necessary adjusted for specific profit  margins,
     to  estimated  total  cost for each contract or workorder.  Contract  costs
     include  all direct material and labor costs and overhead costs related  to
     contract  performance.   Unanticipated  changes  in  job  performance,  job
     conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and
     income,  and  are  recognized  in the period in  which  the  revisions  are
     determined.    Such   contracts  generally  have  no   customer   retainage
     provisions.  Except for a manufacturing contract at Global, which is billed
     on  a  progress billing basis, the Company generally bills its customer  at
     the time of completion of the contract or workorder.

     Operating Expenses Reimbursed by Customer - The Company, under the terms of
     its  air  cargo dry-lease service contracts, passes through  to  its  major
     customer  certain  cost components of its operations without  markup.   The
     cost  of  flight crews, fuel, landing fees, outside maintenance and certain
     other  direct operating costs are included in operating expenses and billed
     to the customer, at cost, as cargo and maintenance revenue.

     Stock  Based  Compensation   - The Company  measures  employee  stock
     compensation plans based on the intrinsic method of accounting,  with  pro-
     forma  disclosure of net earnings and earnings per share determined  as  if
     the  fair  value  based  method had been applied in measuring  compensation
     cost.

     Income  Taxes - Income taxes are provided for temporary differences between
     the  tax and financial accounting bases of assets and liabilities using the
     asset  and liability method.  Deferred income taxes are recognized for  the
     tax  consequence  of  such temporary differences at the  enacted  tax  rate
     expected to be in effect when the differences reverse.

     Accounting Estimates - The preparation of consolidated financial statements
     in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires
     management  to  make  estimates and assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts
     reported.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Significant
     estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory
     reserve, intangible pension asset, deferred retirement obligations and
     revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method.

     Recent  Accounting Pronouncements - In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting
     Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting  Standard
     No.  133,  ("SFAS 133") "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and  Hedging
     Activities", which requires all derivative instruments to be recognized  on
     the  balance  sheet  at their fair value.  Changes in  the  fair  value  of
     derivatives  are  to be recorded each period either in other  comprehensive
     income  or  in current earnings depending on the use of the derivative  and
     whether  it qualifies for hedge accounting.  SFAS No. 133 was effective for
     the Company beginning on April 1, 2001.  The adoption  of SFAS No. 133 did
     not significantly impact the Company's financial statements.

     Reclassifications - Certain reclassifications have been made to 2000 and
     1999 amounts to conform to current year presentation.

6.   FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

     On  May  31, 2001 the Company expanded its bank financing line  to  a
     $10,000,000  credit  facility.   Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,   a
     $7,000,000 secured long-term revolving credit line, which expires on August
     31,  2002,  replaced the Company's existing $8,500,000 unsecured short-term
     revolving  credit  line,  which was due to  expire  in  August  2001.   The
     remaining $3,000,000 of the credit facility was set up as a five-year  term
     loan  which  expires  on  May 31, 2006 and is scheduled  to  be  repaid  in
     quarterly principal payments of $150,000 plus accrued interest.


     Long-term debt maturities are as follows (adjusted to reflect the
     subsequent refinancing in May 2001):


              2002                        $    450,000
              2003                             600,000
              2004                           3,364,000
              2005                             600,000
              2006                             600,000
              Thereafter                       150,000

              Total                       $  5,764,000



     Both the credit facility in effect at March 31, 2001 and the new credit
     facility contain customary events of default and  restrictive covenants
     that,  among  other matters, require  the  Company  to  maintain
     certain  financial ratios.  As of March 2001, the Company was in compliance
     with  all of the restrictive covenants.  The amount of credit available  to
     the  Company  under  the agreement at any given time is  determined  by  an
     availability calculation, based on the eligible borrowing base, as  defined
     in   the   credit  agreement  which  includes  the  Company's   outstanding
     receivables,  inventories  and  equipment, with  certain  exclusions.   The
     credit facility is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets.

     Amounts  advanced  under the credit facility bear interest  at  the  30-day
     "LIBOR"  rate plus 137 basis points.  The LIBOR rate at March 31, 2001  was
     5.28%. At March 31, 2001 and 2000, the amounts outstanding against the line
     were   $5,764,000  and  $3,988,000,  respectively.   At  March  31,   2001,
     $2,736,000 was available under the entire credit facility.

     The Company has classified $5,162,000 of its outstanding bank debt as
     long-term  as  of  March 31, 2001 to reflect the terms included  under  the
     agreement  signed  on  May  31, 2001.  The Company  also  entered  into  a
     swap agreement  on May 31, 2001 to fix the interest rate on the $3,000,000
     term portion and $2,000,000 of the revolving portion of the credit facility
     at respective interest rates of 6.97% and 6.50%.

7.   LEASE COMMITMENTS

     The Company has operating lease commitments for office equipment and its
     office and maintenance facilities as well as capital leases for certain
     office and other equipment.  The Company leases its corporate office
     and  certain  maintenance facilities from a company controlled  by  Company
     officers for $8,073 per month under a five year lease which expired in  May
     2001.  In May 2001, the lease was renewed through May 2006, at $9,147 per
     month.

     In August 1996, the Company relocated certain portions of its maintenance
     operations to a new maintenance facility located at the Global TransPark in
     Kinston,  N. C.  Under the terms of the long-term facility lease, after  an
     18  month  grace period (from date of occupancy), rent will  escalate  from
     $2.25  per  square foot to $5.90 per square foot, per year, over  the  21.5
     year life of the lease.  However, based on the occurrence of certain events
     the  lease may be canceled by the Company.  The Company currently considers
     the  lease  to  be  non-cancelable for seven years and has calculated  rent
     expense on a straight-line basis over this portion of the lease term.

     In August 1997 Global, located in Olathe, Kansas, leased approximately
     57,000 square feet of manufacturing space for $17,030 per month, under a
     two-year operating lease originally set to expire in  September 1999.  In
     September 1998, the lease was expanded to 112,500 square feet of
     manufacturing and office space for $35,903 per month expiring August 2001.
     In April 2001, the lease was renewed through August 2006, monthly rental
     will increase from $28,967 to $30,847 over the life of the lease.

     At  March 31, 2001, future minimum annual lease payments under capital and
     non-cancellable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of  more
     than one year are as follows:

                                             Capital              Operating
                                              Leases                Leases

     2002                               $      59,091          $    802,389
     2003                                      44,964               490,699
     2004                                      38,036               421,076
     2005                                      35,223               364,476
     2006                                      13,115               370,104

     Total minimum lease payments       $     190,429          $  2,448,744

     Less amount representing interest         35,703

     Present value of lease payments          154,726

     Less current maturities                   49,719

     Long-term maturities               $     105,007

     Rent expense for operating leases amounted to approximately $819,000,
     $728,000, and $623,000 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Rent expense
     to related parties was $96,900 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

8.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

     The Company may issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or
     more  series,  on  such  terms  and  with  such  rights,  preferences   and

     awards  been  determined at the grant dates based on the fair market  value
     method  described  in FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting  for  Stock-Based
     Compensation" the Company's pro forma net income would have been
     $1,240,350, or  $0.45 per diluted share, and  $279,927, or $0.10 per
     diluted share, respectively, for 2001 and 2000.  The effect on 1999 was
     immaterial.

11.  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

     The Company has a 401K defined contribution plan (AirT 401(K) Retirement
     Plan).  All employees of the Company are eligible to participate  in  the
     plan.  The Company's contribution to the 401(K) plan for the years  ended
     March 31, 2001,  2000  and  1999 was $229,000,  $229,000,  and  $191,000,
     respectively.

     The Company, in each of the past three years, has paid a discretionary
     profit  sharing  bonus  in  which  all employees  have  participated.   The
     Company's March 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 expense was $400,000, $126,000 and
     $147,000, respectively.

     Effective January 1, 1996 the Company entered into supplemental retirement
     agreements  with certain key executives of the Company, to  provide  for  a
     monthly benefit upon retirement.  The following table sets forth the funded
     status of the plan at March 31, 2001 and 2000.


                                                  March 31,

       balance sheet                  $    1,392,100     $    1,204,109


     In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
     Standards  No.  87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," the  Company  has
     recorded  an  additional minimum liability representing the excess  of  the
     accumulated  benefit  obligation over the fair value  of  plan  assets  and
     accrued  pension liability for its pension plan.  The additional  liability
     has been offset by an intangible asset to the extent of prior service cost.
     The  portion  of  the additional liability which exceeds  the  unrecognized
     prior  service  cost in fiscal 2001 totaled $18,331 and is  reported  as  a
     component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.

     The  projected benefit obligation was determined using an assumed  discount
     rate of 7% and an assumed rate of return on assets of 6%.  The liability
     relating to these benefits has been included in deferred retirement
     obligation in the accompanying financial statements.

     Net  periodic pension expense for fiscal 2001 and 2000  included  the
     following:

                                            2001            2000

     Net periodic pension cost       $     240,385     $    219,456


     The Company's former Chairman and CEO passed away on April 18, 1997. Under
     the  terms of his supplemental retirement agreement, approximately $498,000
     in  present value of death benefits is required to be paid to fulfill death
     benefit  payments  over the next 10 years.  As of March 31,  2001  accruals
     related   to   the  unpaid  present  value  of  the  benefit  amounted   to
     approximately  $308,000(of which approximately $260,000 is included under
     deferred retirement obligations in the accompanying balance sheet).  The
     net periodic pension costs  are  included  in general  and  administrative
     expenses  in  the  accompanying  consolidated statements of earnings.

12.  NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

     Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing net earnings by
     the  weighted  average  number  of common shares  outstanding  during  each
     period.   For  purposes of calculating diluted earnings per  share,  shares
     issuable  under  employee  stock  options  were  considered  common   share
     equivalents and were included in the weighted average common shares.

     The computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share is  as
     follows:

                                              Year Ended March 31,

                                          2001          2000       1999

     Net earnings                     $ 1,288,925   $  361,857   $   522,704

     Weighted average common shares:
     Shares outstanding - basic         2,733,428    2,757,549     2,697,509
     Dilutive stock options                47,304       79,849        96,445
     Shares outstanding - diluted       2,780,732    2,837,398     2,793,954

     Net earnings per common share:

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

Effective January 1, 1996, the Company and each of its subsidiaries entered into
employment  agreements  with J. Hugh Bingham, John J.  Gioffre  and  William  H.
Simpson, each of substantially similar form.  Each of such employment agreements
provides for an annual base salary ($130,000, $103,443 and $165,537 for  Messrs.
Bingham,  Gioffre and Simpson, respectively) which may be increased upon  annual
review  by  the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.   In
addition, each such agreement provides for the payment of annual incentive bonus
compensation  equal  to a percentage (2.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% for  Messrs.  Bingham,
Gioffre and Simpson, respectively) of the Company's consolidated earnings before
income  taxes and extraordinary items as reported by the Company in  its  Annual
Report  on Form 10-K.  Payment of such bonus is to be made within 15 days  after
the  Company  files  its  Annual Report on Form 10-K  with  the  Securities  and
Exchange Commission.

The  initial term of each such employment agreement expired on March  31,  1999,
and  the  term  is automatically extended for additional one-year  terms  unless
either  such executive officer or the Company's Board of Directors gives  notice
to terminate automatic extensions which must be given by December 1 of each year
(commencing with December 1, 1996).

Each  such  agreement provides that upon the executive officer's retirement,  he
shall be entitled to receive an annual benefit equal to $75,000 ($60,000 for Mr.
Gioffre),  reduced by three percent for each full year that the  termination  of
his  employment   precedes the date he reaches age 65.  The retirement  benefits
under  such  agreements may be paid at the executive officer's election  in  the
form  of a single life annuity or a joint and survivor annuity or a life annuity
with  a ten-year period certain.  In addition, such executive officer may  elect
to  receive  the entire retirement benefit in a lump sum payment  equal  to  the
present  value  of  the  benefit based on standard insurance  annuity  mortality
tables and an interest rate equal to the 90-day average of the yield on ten-year
U.S. Treasury Notes.

Retirement  benefits shall be paid commencing on such executive  officer's  65th
birthday, provided that such executive officer may elect to receive benefits  on
the  later  of  his  62nd birthday, in which case benefits will  be  reduced  as
described  above, or the date on which his employment terminates, provided  that
notice of his termination of employment is given at least one year prior to  the
termination  of  employment.  Any retirement benefits due under  the  employment
agreement  shall be offset by any other retirement benefits that such  executive
officer  receives under any plan maintained by the Company.  In the  event  such
executive  officer  becomes totally disabled prior to  retirement,  he  will  be
entitled to receive retirement benefits calculated as described above.

In  the event of such executive officer's death before retirement, the agreement
provides  that the Company shall be required to pay an annual death  benefit  to
such  officer's  estate equal to the single life annuity benefit such  executive
officer would have received if he had terminated employment on the later of  his
65th  birthday  or the date of his death, payable over ten years; provided  that
such  amount  would  be  reduced by five percent for each  year  such  executive
officer's death occurs prior to age 65, but in no event more than 50 percent.

Each  of the employment agreements provides that if the Company terminates  such
executive  officer's  employment  other than for  "cause"  (as  defined  in  the
agreement),  such  executive officer be entitled to  receive  a  lump  sum  cash
payment equal to the amount of base salary payable for the remaining term of the
agreement  (at  the  then current rate) plus one-half of the  maximum  incentive
bonus  compensation  that would be payable if such executive  officer  continued
employment through the date of the expiration of the agreement(assuming for such
purposes  that the amount of incentive bonus compensation would be the  same  in
each  of the years remaining under the agreement as was paid for the most recent
year  prior  to  termination  of employment).  Each of  the  agreements  further
provides  that  if  any  payment  on termination  of  employment  would  not  be
deductible by the Company under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code,
the amount of such payment would be reduced to the largest amount that would  be
fully deductible by the Company.

Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.

The  Company  leases  its  corporate  and operating  facilities  at  the  Little
Mountain,  North Carolina airport from Little Mountain Airport Associates,  Inc.
("Airport  Associates"), a corporation whose stock is owned by J. Hugh  Bingham,
William  H.  Simpson,  John  J. Gioffre, the estate of  David  Clark  and  three
unaffiliated third parties.  Walter Clark and Allison Clark are beneficiaries of
the estate of David Clark, and Walter Clark is also a co-executor of the estate.
On  May 31, 2001, the Company renewed its lease for this facility, scheduled  to
expire on that date, for an additional five-year term, and adjusted the rent  to
account  for  increases  in the consumer price index.   Upon  the  renewal,  the
monthly  rental payment was increased from $8,073 to $9,147.  The  Company  paid
aggregate  rental  payments of $96,876 to Airport Associates  pursuant  to  such
lease  during  the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001.  The Company believes  that
the  terms  of  such lease are no less favorable to the Company  than  would  be
available from an independent third party.
