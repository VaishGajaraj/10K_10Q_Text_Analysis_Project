                                 ______
Item 1.          Business.
__________________________

Alico, Inc. (the "Company"), was formed February 29, 1960 as a spinoff of
the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company and is generally recognized as an
agribusiness company operating in Central and Southwest Florida.  The
Company's primary asset is 141,764 acres of land located in Collier, Hendry,
Lee and Polk Counties.  (See table on Page 7 for location and acreage by
current primary use.)  The Company is involved in various operations and
activities including citrus fruit production, cattle ranching, sugarcane and
sod production, and forestry.  The Company also leases land for farming,
cattle grazing, recreation, and oil exploration.

The Company's land is managed for multiple use wherever possible.  Cattle
ranching, forestry and land leased for farming, grazing, recreation and oil
exploration, in some instances, utilize the same acreage.

Agricultural operations have combined to produce from 67 to 82 percent of
total annual revenues during the past five years.  Citrus groves generate the
most gross operating revenue.  Sugarcane ranks second in operating revenue
production. While the cattle ranching operation utilizes the largest acreage,
it ranks third in the production of operating revenue.  Approximately 8,748
acres of the Company's property are classified as timberlands, however, the
area in which these lands are located is not highly rated for timber
production. These lands are also utilized as native range, in the ranching
operation, and leased out for recreation and oil exploration.

Diversification of the Company's agricultural base was initiated with the
development of a Sugarcane Division at the end of the 1988 fiscal year.
The 11,840 acres in production during the 2003 fiscal year consisted of
2,477 acres planted in 1998, 4,052 acres planted in 1999, 2,550 acres
planted in 2000 and 2,761 acres planted in 2001.

Leasing of lands for rock mining and oil and mineral exploration, rental of
land for grazing, farming, recreation and other uses, while not classified
as agricultural operations, are important components of the Company's land
utilization and operation.  Gross revenue from these activities during the
past five years has ranged from 4 to 5 percent of total revenue.

The Company is not in the retail land sales and development business, except
through its wholly owned subsidiary, Saddlebag Lake Resorts, Inc.  However,
it does from time to time sell properties which, in the judgment of
management, are surplus to the Company's primary operations.  Additionally,
the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Alico-Agri, Ltd., engages in bulk
land sales in connection with the generation of underwriting capital.
Revenues from sales of real estate during the past five years has ranged from
10 to 26 percent of total revenues.








For further discussion of the relative importance of the various segments
of the Company's operations, including financial information regarding
revenues, operating profits (losses) and assets attributable to each major
segment of the Company's business, see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" included elsewhere in this document.

Subsidiary Operations
_____________________

The Company has three wholly owned subsidiaries; Saddlebag Lake Resorts,
Inc. ("Saddlebag") Agri-Insurance Company, Ltd. ("Agri") and Alico-Agri, Ltd.
("A/A").

Saddlebag has been active in the subdividing, development and sale of
real estate since its inception in 1971. Saddlebag has two
subdivisions near Frostproof, Florida which have been developed
and are on the market.  While one of the subdivisions has been sold
out, approximately 69% of the lots in the second development have been sold.

Agri, formed during fiscal 2000, was created to write crop insurance
against catastrophic losses due to weather and disease.  During fiscal
2002, Agri supplied reinsurance to an independent underwriter who insured
catastrophic business interruption coverage for Ben Hill Griffin, Inc.
The total coverage under the policy was $3.5 million and the premium charged
was $138 thousand.  The coverage term was from December 2002 to December 2003.
The Company expects to renew the policy and appropriately adjust premium
rates.  Additionally, Agri directly underwrote catastrophic business
interruption coverage for its parent company, Alico, Inc., insuring all but
two of Alico's citrus groves.  The coverage term was from August 2002 to
August 2003.  Total coverage under the policy was $12.7 million and the
premium charged was $803 thousand.  Alico, Inc., renewed the policy in
August 2003, extending the coverage term to August 2004.  The coverage
under the renewal was $13.6 million and the premium charge was $858 thousand.

Agri underwrote catastrophic business coverage for Alico's remaining two
groves under a policy covering the term from January 2003 to January 2004.
Total coverage under the policy is $2.0 million, and the premium charged was
$119 thousand.

Alico-Agri, Ltd. was formed during fiscal 2003 to manage the real estate
holdings of Agri.  The partnership allows Alico to provide management and
administrative services so that Agri can focus on insurance issues.  Agri
transferred all of its property holdings and the related contracts to
A/A for a 99% partnership interest.  Alico, the managing partner,
transferred cash for a 1% interest in the partnership.

The financial results of the operation of these subsidiaries
are consolidated with those of the Company.  (See Note 1 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.)











Citrus
______

Approximately 9,715 acres of citrus were harvested during the 2002/03 season.
Since 1983 the Company has maintained a marketing contract covering the
majority of the Company's citrus crop with Ben Hill Griffin, Inc., a
Florida corporation and major shareholder.  The agreement provides for
modifications to meet changing market conditions and provides that either
party may terminate the contract by giving notice prior to the first day of
August preceding each fruit season.  Under the terms of the contract,  the
Company's fruit is packed and/or processed and sold along with fruit from
other growers, including Ben Hill Griffin, Inc.  The proceeds
are distributed on a pro rata basis as the finished product is sold.

During the year ended August 31, 2003, approximately 75% of the Company's
fruit crop was marketed under this agreement, as compared to 77% for each
of the years ended August 31, 2002 and August 31, 2001.  In addition,
Ben Hill Griffin, Inc. provides harvesting services to the Company for citrus
sold to unrelated processors.  These sales accounted for the remaining 25% of
total citrus revenue for the year.

Sugarcane
_________

The Company had 11,840 acres, 11,680 acres, and 11,722 acres of sugarcane
in production during the 2003, 2002, and 2001 fiscal years, respectively.
The 2003, 2002, and 2001 fiscal year crops yielded approximately 413,000,
376,000, and 417,000 gross tons, respectively.

Ranch
______

The Company has a cattle operation located in Hendry and Collier Counties,
Florida which is engaged primarily in the production of beef cattle and the
raising of replacement heifers.  The breeding herd consists of
approximately 13,428 cows, bulls and replacement heifers.  Approximately
42% of the herd are from one to five years old, while the remaining 58% are
six and older.  The Company primarily sells to packing and processing
plants.  The Company also sells cattle through local livestock auction
markets and to contract cattle buyers.  These buyers provide ready markets
for the Company's cattle.  The loss of any one or a few of these plants
and/or buyers would not, in management's view, have a material adverse
effect on the Company's cattle operation.  Subject to prevailing market
conditions, the Company may hedge its beef inventory by entering into cattle
futures contracts to reduce exposure to changes in market prices.

Forest Products
_______________

Approximately 6% of the Company's properties are classified as timberlands.
The principal forest products sold by the Company are sabal palms and other
horticultural commodities.  These products are sold to various landscaping
companies.  The Company does not incur any of the harvesting expenses.









Part of the land, from which the timber was removed, is being converted to
semi-improved pasture and other uses.

Mining Operations: Rock and Sand
_________________________________

The Company leases approximately 5,714 acres in Lee County, Florida
to CSR America, Inc. of West Palm Beach, Florida for mining and production
of rock, aggregate, sand, baserock and other road building and construction
materials.

Royalties which the company receives for these products are based on a
percentage of the F.O.B. plant sales price.

Land Rental for Grazing, Agricultural and Other Uses
____________________________________________________

The Company rents land to others for grazing, farming and recreational
uses, on a tenant-at-will basis, for an annual fee.  The income is not
significant when compared to overall gross income, however, it does help to
offset the expense of carrying these properties until they are put to a
more profitable use.  The Company has developed additional land to lease
for farming.

There were no significant changes in the method of rental for these
purposes during the past fiscal year.


Leases for Oil and Mineral Exploration
______________________________________

The Company has leased subsurface rights to a portion of its properties
for the purpose of oil and mineral exploration.  Currently, there are two
leases in effect.

Twenty-four wells have been drilled during the years that the Company has
been leasing subsurface rights to oil companies.  The drilling has resulted
in twenty-one dry holes, one marginal producer, which has been abandoned,
and two average producers, still producing.

Competition
___________

As indicated, the Company is primarily engaged in a limited number of
agricultural activities, all of which are highly competitive.  For
instance, citrus is grown in several states, the most notable of which are:
Florida, California, Arizona and Texas.  In addition, citrus and sugarcane
products are imported from some foreign countries.  Beef cattle are
produced throughout the United States and domestic beef sales must also
compete with sales of imported beef.  Additionally, forest and rock
products are produced in most parts of the United States.  Leasing of land
for oil exploration is also widespread.








All of the Company's sales are to United States purchasers.  The Company's
share of the market for citrus, sugarcane, cattle and forest products in the
United States is insignificant.

Environmental Regulations
_________________________

The Company's operation is subject to various federal, state and local laws
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment.  The Company is
in compliance with all such rules and such compliance has not had a material
effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the
Company.

While compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material
economic effect on the Company's operations, executive officers are
required to spend a considerable amount of time keeping current on these
matters.  In addition, there are ongoing costs incurred in complying with
the permitting and reporting requirements.

Employees
_________

At the end of August 2003, the Company had a total of 143 full-time
employees classified as follows:  Citrus 75; Ranch 15; Sugarcane 12;
Facilities Maintenance Support 26; General and Administrative 15.  There
are no employees engaged in the development of new products or research.
Management is not aware of any efforts by employees or outside organizers
to create any type of labor union arrangement.  Management believes that
the employer/employee relationship environment is such that labor
organization activities are unlikely to occur.

Seasonal Nature of Business
___________________________

As with any agribusiness enterprise, the Company's business operations are
predominantly seasonal in nature.  The harvest and sale of citrus fruit
generally occurs from October to June.  Sugarcane is harvested during the
first, second and third quarters.  Other segments of the Company's business
such as its cattle and sod sales, and its timber, mining and leasing
operations, tend to be more successive than seasonal in nature.

Item 2.          Properties.
____________________________

At August 31, 2003, the Company owned a total of 141,764 acres of land
located in four counties in Florida.  Acreage in each county and the
primary classification with respect to present use of these properties is
shown in the following table:


                 ACREAGE BY CURRENT PRIMARY USE

         ______  _______   ______  ___  _____  _____ ______  _____  _______
         ______  _______   ______  ___  _____  _____ ______  _____  _______

Of the above lands, the Company utilizes approximately 20,977 acres of
improved pasture plus approximately 49,000 acres of native pasture for cattle
production and approximately 5,714 acres are leased for rock mining
operations.  Much of the land is also leased for multi-purpose use such as
cattle grazing, oil exploration, agriculture and recreation.

In addition to the land shown in the above table, the Company owns full
subsurface rights to 1,064 acres and fractional subsurface rights to
18,707 acres located throughout the Counties referred to above.

From the inception of the Company's initial development program in 1948,
the goal has been to develop the lands for the most profitable use.  Prior
to implementation of the development program, detailed studies were made of
the properties focusing on soil capabilities, topography, transportation,
availability of markets and the climatic characteristics of each of the
tracts.  Based on these and later studies, the use of each tract was
determined.  It is the opinion of Management that the lands are suitable
for agricultural, residential and commercial uses.  However, since the
Company is primarily engaged in agricultural activities, some of the lands
are considered surplus to its needs for this purpose and, as indicated
under Item 1 of this report, sales of real property are made from time to
time.










Management believes that each of the major programs is adequately supported
by agricultural equipment, buildings, fences, irrigation systems and other
amenities required for the operation of the projects.


Item 3.          Legal Proceedings.
___________________________________

Ben Hill Griffin III, Chairman of
the Board, was a party to a lawsuit filed against him in Polk County,
Florida Circuit Court by the families of his four sisters, most of the
members of whom are beneficiaries of a trust, entitled the Ben Hill
Griffin, Jr. Revocable Inter Vivos Trust #1 (the "Trust"). The plaintiffs
in the lawsuit (The Four Sisters Protectorate, et al. v. Ben Hill Griffin,
III, Trustee, Case No. GC-G-0054, Section 81) sought to impose judicial
sanctions on Mr. Griffin III, including his removal as Trustee of the Trust
based on allegations of over-compensation and receipt of an illegal bonus.

The Company has been informed by Mr. Griffin III, that he has executed a
"Settlement Agreement" with the families of his four sisters, The Four Sisters
Protectorate, and that the enforceability of the settlement agreement was
affirmed by both the Circuit court, Case number GC-G-0054, and the second
District Court of Appeals for the State of Florida, Case numbers 2D01-5407 and
2D03-0499.  A second litigation challenging the enforceability of the
settlement Agreement, Case number 4:01CU432-RH, was dismissed with prejudice
by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida,
Tallahassee Division.

The Settlement Agreement had been entered into subject to certain conditions,
including Internal Revenue Service approval of the proposed transaction as a
tax free split-off for federal income tax purposes and judicial termination
of the Trust.  Mr. Griffin, III has informed the Company that (a) the issues
related to the mechanism and terms of the proposed distribution of certain of
the assets of the Trust to the families of the four sisters, including the
Alico stock beneficially owned by the Trust, have been worked out between the
representatives of the four sisters and Ben Hill Griffin, III and are set
forth in a definitive separation agreement, and (b) the parties have received
a favorable IRS Revenue Ruling related to the original "Settlement Agreement".

On June 11, 2003, BHG Investments, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ben Hill
Griffin, Inc. (BHG) and the record owner of 3,493,777 shares of the Company
(the "Alico Shares") was merged into Alico Holding, LLC (the "Merger"),
another entity wholly owned by BHG.  Also on June 11, 2003, Mr. Griffin,
III, individually and as trustee of the Trust, BHG, and BHG Investments (prior
to consummation of the Merger) and certain beneficiaries of the Trust entered
into a supplemental settlement agreement (the "Griffin Agreement"), which
set forth certain actions to be performed by Mr. Griffin, III, as Trustee, to
facilitate the performance of a separate supplement agreement that had been
executed on June 5, 2003, by and among other of the Trust's beneficiaries
and members of their respective families (the "2003 Mediated Settlement
Agreement").  The purpose of both the Griffin Agreement and the 2003 Mediated
Settlement Agreement, each resulting from further mediation, was to finally
settle all disputes among the parties to the Mediation Settlement Agreement,
thereby facilitating final performance of the Settlement Agreement.







On August 6, 2003, an Order Approving Supplemental Mediation Settlement
Agreements was entered by the Tenth Judicial Circuit Court in and for Polk
County, Florida, Case No. GC-G-0054, approving the Griffin Agreement and the
2003 Mediated Settlement Agreements as being in the best interests of all
persons having any interest in the Trust and authorizing Mr. Griffin III, as
trustee, to perform all of the actions required of him under each agreement.
Those actions, following receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service that takes into account the changes to the Griffin
Agreement and the "2003 Mediated Settlement Agreement", will result
in the transfer and assignment of the Alico Shares to a Florida corporation
formed for the purpose of transferring and assigning of substantially all
shares of that corporation's issued and outstanding voting stock to Atlantic
Blue Trust, Inc. (ABT), an entity to be formed as a subsidiary of BHG
Investments.  BHG  Investments will then distribute the stock of ABT up to
BHG the parent company of BHG Investments, which will then transfer such
Stock to The Four Sisters Protectorate and the Protectorate Family Trusts,
trusts for the benefit of Mr. Griffin, III's four sisters and their lineal
descendants, so as to cause control of Alico to shift from Mr. Griffin, III
to such trusts.

The Company is not a party to any of this litigation.

The Company is also involved in certain other claims and legal actions arising
in the ordinary course of its business.  The ultimate disposition of all such
matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The Company's Board of directors, at its meeting on October 7, 2003, declared
a dividend of $.60 per share payable on October 31, 2003 to shareholders of
record on October 17, 2003.  Dividends are paid at the discretion of the
Company's Board of Directors. The Company foresees no change in its ability to
pay annual dividends in the immediate future; nevertheless, there is no
assurance that dividends will be paid in the future since they are dependent
upon earnings, the financial condition of the Company, and other factors.

This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and notes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
_______________________________

The Company had cash and marketable securities of $55.2 million at August
31, 2003, compared with $31.6 million at August 31, 2002.  Working capital
was $79.5 million and $56.7 million at August 31, 2003 and August 31, 2002
respectively.

Cash outlay for land, equipment, buildings, and other improvements totaled
$7.3 million during fiscal 2003, compared to $9.3 million during fiscal
2002 and $8.5 million during fiscal 2001, respectively. Land preparation for
citrus re-development and capital maintenance continued, as did expenditures
for replacement equipment and raising of breeding cattle.

Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its working
capital requirements for the foreseeable future with internally generated
funds.  In addition, the Company has credit commitments which provide
for revolving credit of up to $54.0 million, of which $10.2 million was
available for the Company's general use at August 31, 2003 (see Note 6 of

Operating Revenue
_________________

Operating revenues for fiscal 2003 decreased compared to fiscal 2002.
A decrease in revenues from agricultural activities was the most
significant factor in the decline.







Operating revenues for fiscal 2002 decreased when compared to those of
fiscal 2001.  A decrease in revenues from agricultural activities was
the most significant factor in the decline.

Income (loss) from Operations
_____________________________

Earnings from operations increased significantly during fiscal 2003 when
compared to the prior year ( $ 4,703  in fiscal 2003 vs. $(1,128) in fiscal
2002).  The improvement in earnings was largely impacted by the Company's
fiscal 2002 commitment to donate $5.0 million to Florida Gulf Coast University
(the University) in December 2001, for a new athletic complex, scholarships
and athletic programs.  In accordance with the Company's agreement with the
University, $1.0 million was paid in fiscal 2002, $800 thousand was paid
in fiscal 2003, and $800 thousand will be paid each year over the next four
years.  The entire donation was accrued and included in general and
administrative expenses during fiscal 2002.  The remaining increase in gross
profits from operations was due to an increase in earnings from agricultural
activities.

Income from operations decreased 117% during fiscal 2002 when compared to
fiscal 2001, primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses
resulting from the accrued University donation.

Interest and Investment Income
______________________________

Interest and investment income is generated principally from investments in
marketable equity securities, corporate and municipal bonds, mutual funds,
U.S. Treasury securities and mortgages held on real estate sold on the
installment basis.  Realized investment earnings were reinvested throughout
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, increasing investment levels during each year.
The decrease in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, interest and realized and
unrealized investment income resulted from unfavorable conditions in the
financial markets.

Interest Expense
________________

Interest expense declined during fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002,
as interest rates on borrowings have declined.

Interest expense decreased during fiscal 2002, compared to fiscal 2001.
This was due to a decline in interest rates on borrowings.

Citrus
______

Gross profit was $4.0 million in fiscal 2003, $3.7 million in fiscal 2002,
and $5.1 million for fiscal 2001.

Revenue from citrus sales decreased 4% during fiscal 2003, compared to
fiscal 2002 ($24.1 million during fiscal 2003 vs. $25.1 million during
fiscal 2002).

Pounds of fruit solids per box decreased during fiscal 2003, compared to
fiscal 2002, and was the primary cause of the decline.

Harvesting and marketing costs decreased when compared to fiscal 2002
due to procedural efficiencies that resulted in a decrease in the per
box rate during the year.  Direct production and allocated costs decreased 7%
due to a decrease in the costs of cultivation and irrigation impacted by
improved weather conditions.

Revenue from citrus sales decreased 9% during fiscal 2002, compared
to fiscal 2001 ($25.1 million during fiscal 2002 vs. $27.6 million during
fiscal 2001).








Production decreased during fiscal 2002, compared to fiscal 2001 and was
the primary cause of the decline.
Harvesting and marketing costs decreased in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal
2001, corresponding to a decrease in boxes harvested.  Direct production
and allocated costs decreased 3% due to a decline in the number of producing
acres.

The final returns from citrus pools are not precisely determinable at year
end.  Returns are estimated each year based on the most current information
available.  Differences between the estimates and the final realization
of revenues can be significant.  Revenues collected in excess of prior
year and year end estimates were $198 thousand, $568 thousand, and
$617 thousand during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Sugarcane
_________

Gross profit for fiscal 2003 was $3.2 million, compared to $2.3 million in
fiscal 2002 and $2.8 million in fiscal 2001.

Sales revenue from sugarcane increased 13% during fiscal 2003, compared to
fiscal 2002 ($13.4 million vs. $11.8 million, respectively).  The increase was
the result of an improvement in the yield per acre brought about by favorable
weather conditions during the growing season.  Direct production costs
decreased 3% during fiscal 2003, compared to fiscal 2002.  This was offset by
a 5% rise in allocated costs during 2003, compared to 2002 levels, due to
increases in insurance costs and ad valorem taxes.







Sales revenues from sugarcane decreased 5% during fiscal 2002, compared to
fiscal 2001 ($11.8 million vs. $12.5 million, respectively).  The decrease in
revenue and related costs was the result of lower yields resulting from a
drought.

Ranching
________

The gross profit from ranch operations for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 was
$385 thousand, $587 thousand, and $1.4 million, respectively.

Revenues from cattle sales decreased 21% during fiscal 2003, compared to
fiscal 2002 ($7.2 million in fiscal 2003 vs. $9.1 million in fiscal 2002).
Direct and allocated production costs decreased by 20% during fiscal 2003,
as compared to fiscal 2002 ($6.8 million in fiscal 2003 vs. $8.5 million in
fiscal 2002).  The decline in revenue and total production costs primarily
resulted from a corresponding decrease in the total number of cattle sold
during fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002.

Revenues from cattle sales increased 3% during fiscal 2002, compared to
fiscal 2001 ($9.1 million in fiscal 2002 vs. $8.8 million in fiscal 2001)
due to increased sales of feeder cattle during the year.

Direct and allocated costs increased 15% when compared to the prior year
($8.5 million during fiscal 2002 and $7.4 million during fiscal 2001)
due to the increase in the number of animals sold from feedlots.

The Company's cattle marketing activities include retention of calves in
western feedlots, contract and auction sales, and risk management contracts.

Other Operations
________________

Returns from rock products and sand were $2.2 million for fiscal 2003,
$2.0 million for 2002 and $1.7 million during 2001.  Rock and sand
supplies are sufficient to meet current demand, and no major price changes
have occurred over the past 3 years.

Revenues from oil royalties and land rentals were $973 thousand in fiscal
2003 as compared to $721 thousand in fiscal 2002 and $770 thousand for fiscal
2001. The fiscal 2003 improvement is primarily due to an increase in the
amount of land leased for farming.

Profits from the sale of sabal palms and other horticultural items, for
landscaping purposes, during fiscal 2003 were $292 thousand compared to $355
thousand and $91 thousand for fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Direct and allocated expenses charged to the "Other" operations category
included general and administrative and other costs not charged directly to
the citrus, ranching or sugarcane divisions.  These expenses totaled $6.3
million during fiscal 2003, compared to $10.8 million during fiscal 2002 and
to $5.5 million during fiscal 2001. In December 2001, the Company agreed to
donate $5.0 million to the Florida Gulf Coast University for a new athletic
complex, scholarships and athletic programs.  As per the agreement with the







University, $1.0 million was paid in fiscal 2002, $800 thousand was paid
in fiscal 2003 and $800 thousand will be paid each year over the next four
years.  The net present value of the total donation was accrued and included
in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2002 and was the primary
cause for the increase in general and administrative expenses that year.



Profit on Sale of Real Estate
____________________________________

Profit from retail land sales, made through Saddlebag, were $32 thousand
in fiscal 2003, vs. breaking even during fiscal 2002.  Profit from bulk land
sales, increased from $11.6 million in fiscal 2002 to $15.0 million in fiscal
2003.

Real estate profits increased from $11.4 million in fiscal 2001 to $11.6
million during fiscal 2002.

General Corporate
_________________

The Company is continuing its marketing and permitting activities for its
land which surrounds Florida Gulf Coast University in Lee County, Florida.
There are sales contracts in place for all this property, totaling $171.8
million.  The agreements are at various stages in the due diligence process
with closing dates expected over the next three years.

During January 2002, the Company acquired 40 acres of Lee County, Florida
property for $9.5 million.  The property is located near one of the interstate
highway access ramps to Florida Gulf Coast University and the Southwest
Florida International Airport.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, Agri
announced a contract to sell the 40 acres.  The contract price is $13.1
million and the closing may occur by December 10, 2004.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, Agri contracted to sell an
additional 53 acres in Lee County, Florida to the Ginn Company.  The contract
price is $10.6 million.  Agri also announced an addition to the original Ginn
Company contract, adding 555 acres for a price of $13.3 million.  This
amendment brought the total acreage of the contract to 5,060.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company entered into a
limited partnership with its wholly owned subsidiary, Agri-Insurance
Company, Ltd.  The partnership was created to manage Agri's real estate
holdings.  Agri transferred all of the Lee County property and associated
sales contracts to the limited partnership, Alico-Agri, Ltd (Alico-Agri)
in return for a 99% partnership interest.  Alico, Inc. transferred $1.2
million cash for a 1% interest.  The creation of the partnership allows
Agri to concentrate solely on insurance matters while utilizing Alico's
knowledge of real estate management.  The partnership will pay Alico a
management fee for real estate management and administrative services.










In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company, through Alico-Agri,
completed the sale of 313 acres in Lee County, Florida to Airport Interstate
Associates, LLC.  The sales price was $9.7 million and resulted in a gain of
$8.7 million.  Additionally, Alico-Agri completed the sale of 40 acres in Lee
County, Florida to University Club Apartments/Gulf Coast, LLC.  The sales
price of the property was $5.5 million and generated a gain of $4.7 million.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company sold 358 acres in
Hendry County, Florida for $669 thousand.  The  sale generated a gain of
$335 thousand.  Additionally, the Company sold 266 acres in Polk County,
Florida for $617 thousand, generating a gain of $612 thousand.


The Company announced the formation of Agri-Insurance Company, Ltd. (Agri)
a wholly owned subsidiary, during July of 2000.  The insurance company was
initially capitalized by transferring cash and approximately 3,000 acres of
the Lee County property. Through Agri, the Company has been able to underwrite
previously uninsurable risk related to catastrophic crop and other losses. The
coverages currently underwritten by Agri will indemnify insured's for the
loss of the revenue stream resulting from a catastrophic event that would
cause a grove to be replanted.  To expedite the creation of the capital
liquidity necessary to underwrite the Company's exposure to catastrophic
losses, another 5,600 acres was transferred during fiscal 2001.  Agri
underwrote a limited amount of coverage for Ben Hill Griffin, Inc. during
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 and in August 2002 began insuring the Alico, Inc.,
citrus groves.  As Agri gains underwriting experience and increases its
liquidity, it will be able to increase its insurance programs.  Agri is a
recently created entity.  It would be difficult, if not impossible, to
speculate about the impact that Agri could have on the Company's financial
position, results of operations and liquidity in future periods.  Since the
coverages that have been written, as liquidity has been generated, are
primarily for the benefit of Alico, the financial substance of this venture
is to insure risk that is inherent in the Company's existing operations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Company's financial statements and related disclosures
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going
basis, management evaluates the estimates and assumptions based upon
historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. Management
believes that the estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the
circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and
assumptions under different future circumstances. The following critical
accounting policies have  been identified that affect the more significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements.

The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market. Management
regularly assesses estimated inventory valuations based on current and
forecasted usage of the related commodity and any other relevant factors that
affect the net realizable value.







Based on fruit buyers' and processors' advances to growers, stated cash and
futures markets combined experience in the industry, management reviews the
reasonableness of the citrus revenue accrual.  Adjustments are made throughout
the year to these estimates as relevant information regarding the citrus
market becomes available.  Fluctuation in the market prices for citrus fruit
has caused the Company to recognize additional revenue from prior years'
crop totaling $198 thousand, $568 thousand, and $617 thousand during fiscal
2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

In accordance with Statement of Position 85-3 "Accounting by Agricultural
Producers and Agricultural Cooperatives", the cost of growing crops (citrus
and sugarcane) are capitalized into inventory until the time of harvest.  Once
a given crop is harvested, the related inventoried costs are recognized as
a cost of sale to provide an appropriate matching of costs incurred with the
related revenue earned.

Alico formed a wholly owned insurance subsidiary, Agri Insurance Company,
Ltd. (Bermuda) ("Agri") in June of 2000.  Agri was formed in response to the
lack of insurance availability, both in the traditional commercial insurance
markets and governmental sponsored insurance programs, suitable to provide
coverages for the increasing number and potential severity of agricultural
related events.  Such events include citrus canker, crop diseases, livestock
related maladies and weather.  Alico's goal included not only prefunding its
potential exposures related to the aforementioned events, but also to attempt
to attract new underwriting capital if it is successful in profitably
underwriting its own potential risks as well as similar risks of its historic
business partners.  Alico primarily utilized its inventory of land
and additional contributed capital to bolster the underwriting capacity of
Agri.  As Agri has converted certain of the assets contributed by Alico to
cash, book and tax differences have arisen resulting from differing
viewpoints related to the tax treatment of insurance companies for federal
and state tax purposes.  Due to the historic nature of the primary assets
contributed as capital to Agri and the timing of the sales of certain of
those assets by Agri, management has decided to record a contingent
liability, providing for potential differences in the tax treatment of sales
of Agri's assets.  Management's decision has been influenced by perceived
changes in the regulatory environment.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
______________________________

The Company is not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements that have,
or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the
Company's financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

















Item 7(a).      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk
_________________________________________________________________________

Alico's exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to its investment portfolio.  There are no derivative financial
instruments in the investment portfolio. Investments are placed with high
quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any
one issuer.  Alico is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and
preservation of invested funds by limiting default, market and reinvestment
risk.  The Company classifies cash equivalents and short-term investments as
fixed-rate if the rate of return on such instruments remains fixed over
their term.  These fixed-rate investments include fixed-rate U.S. government
securities, municipal bonds, time deposits and certificates of deposit.
Cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as variable-rate
if the rate of return on such investments varies based on the change in a
predetermined index or set of indices during their term.  These
variable-rate investments primarily include money market accounts, mutual
funds and equities held at various securities brokers and investment banks.
The table below presents the amounts (in thousands) and related weighted
interest/dividend yield rates of the investment portfolio at August 31, 2003:

The Company has debt which has interest rates that vary with the LIBOR and
prime rate.  A 1% change in these rates would impact the Company's annual
interest expense by approximately $438 thousand based on the Company's
outstanding debt under these agreements as of August 31, 2003.

   			 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                  Years Ended August 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001

(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
     __________________________________________

     (a)  Basis of Consolidated Financial Statement Presentation
          ______________________________________________________

          The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
          Alico, Inc. (the Company) and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
          Saddlebag Lake Resorts, Inc. (Saddlebag), Agri-Insurance
          Company, Ltd. (Agri), and Alico-Agri, Ltd. after elimination
          of all significant intercompany balances and transactions.

     (b)  Revenue Recognition
          ___________________

          Income from the sale of citrus is recognized at the time the crop is
          harvested.  Based on fruit buyers' and processors' advances to
          growers, stated cash and futures markets, management reviews the
          reasonableness of the citrus revenue accrual.  Adjustments are made
          throughout the year to these estimates as relevant information
          regarding the citrus market becomes available.  Fluctuation in the
          market prices for citrus fruit has caused the Company to recognize
          additional revenue from the prior year's crop totaling $198
          thousand, $568 thousand, and $617 thousand during fiscal years
          2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

          Income from sugarcane under a pooled agreement is recognized at the
          time the crop is harvested.  Based on the processor's advance
          payment, management reviews the reasonableness of the sugarcane
          revenue accrual.  Adjustments are made as additional relevant
          information regarding the sugar market becomes available.  Market
          price increases to the sugar pool have caused the Company to
          recognize additional revenue from the prior year's crop totaling
          $356 thousand, $318 thousand and $49 thousand during the fiscal
          year's 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

          The Company recognizes revenue from cattle sales at the time the
          cattle are sold at auction.

     (c)  Real Estate
          ___________

          Real estate sales are recorded under the accrual method of
          accounting.  Residential retail land sales made through Saddlebag
          are not recognized until the buyer's initial investment or
          cumulative payments of principal and interest equal or exceed 10
          percent of the contract sales price.  Commercial or bulk land sales,
          made mostly through Alico-Agri, Ltd. are not recognized until
          payments received for property to be developed within two years
          after the sale equal 20%, or property to be developed after two
          years equal 25%, of the contract sales price.  At August 31, 2000,







          the Company did not recognize gross profit totaling $9,540,000
          related to commercial real estate which was sold subject to a
          mortgage note receivable (note 3).  The terms of the sale called for
          10% of the contract price of $10,600,000 to be paid at closing.  The
          $1,060,000 less the land basis and closing costs was recognized
          as a gain on the sale of real estate totaling $287,880 during
          the year ended August 31, 2000.

          During the year ended August 31, 2001, the purchaser made the
          first of four equal annual installments, required in the mortgage,
          totaling $2,385,000, plus interest.  The deferred profit on the
          sale was then recognized as 32.5 percent of the contract
          price was received and the buyer's continuing investment became
          adequate to demonstrate its commitment to pay for the property.

          Profits from commercial real estate sales are discounted to
          reflect the market rate of interest where the stated rate is
          less than the market rate.  The recorded valuation discounts
          are realized as the balances due are collected. In the event
          of early liquidation, interest is recognized on the simple
          interest method.

          Tangible assets that are purchased during the period to aid in
          the sale of the project as well as costs for services performed
          to obtain regulatory approval of the sales are capitalized as
          land and land improvements to the extent they are estimated to be
          recoverable from the sale of the property.  Land and land
          improvement costs are allocated to individual parcels on a per
          lot basis using the relative sales value method.

          The Company has entered into an agreement with a real estate
          consultant to assist in obtaining the necessary regulatory
          approvals for the development and marketing of a tract of raw
          land.  The marketing costs under this agreement are being
          expensed as incurred.  The costs incurred to obtain the necessary
          regulatory approvals are capitalized into land costs when paid.
          These costs will be expensed as cost of sales when the underlying
          real estate is sold.

     (d)  Marketable Securities Available for Sale
          ________________________________________

          Marketable securities available for sale are carried at their
          estimated fair value.  Net unrealized investment gains and losses
          are recorded net of related deferred taxes in accumulated other
          comprehensive income within stockholders' equity until realized.

          Fair value for debt and equity investments is based on quoted
          market prices at the reporting date for those or similar
          investments.  The cost of all marketable securities available for
          sale are determined on the specific identification method.








     (e)  Inventories
          ___________

          The costs of growing crops are capitalized into
          inventory until the time of harvest.  Once a given crop is
          harvested, the related inventoried costs are recognized as
          a cost of sale to provide an appropriate matching of costs incurred
          with the related revenue earned.

          Beef cattle inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
          market.  The cost of the beef cattle inventory is based on the
          accumulated cost of developing such animals for sale.

          Unharvested crops are stated at the lower of cost or market.  The
          cost for unharvested crops is based on accumulated production
          costs incurred during the eight month period from January 1
          through August 31.

     (f)  Property, Buildings and Equipment
          _________________________________

          Property, buildings and equipment are stated at cost.  Properties
          acquired from the Company's predecessor corporation in exchange
          for common stock issued in 1960, at the inception of the Company,
          are stated on the basis of cost to the predecessor corporation.
          Property acquired as part of a land exchange trust is valued at
          the carrying value of the property transferred to the trust.

          All costs related to the development of citrus groves, through
          planting, are capitalized.  Such costs include land clearing,
          excavation and construction of ditches, dikes, roads, and
          reservoirs, etc.  After the planting, caretaking costs or
          pre-productive maintenance costs are capitalized for four years.
          After four years, a grove is considered to have reached maturity
          and the accumulated costs, except for land excavation become
          the depreciable basis of a grove and are written off over 25
          years.

          Development costs for sugarcane are capitalized the same as citrus.
          However, sugarcane matures in one year and the Company is able
          to harvest an average of 3 crops (1 per year) from one planting.
          As a result, cultivation/caretaking costs are expensed as the
          crop is harvested, while the appropriate development and planting
          costs are depreciated over 3 years.

          The breeding herd consists of purchased animals and animals
          raised on the ranch.  Purchased animals are stated at cost.  The
          cost of animals raised on the ranch is based on the accumulated
          cost of developing such animals for productive use.

          Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is computed on
          straight-line or accelerated methods over the estimated useful
          lives of the various classes of depreciable assets.










          The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with
          the provisions of SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment
          or disposal of Long-Lived Assets".
          This Statement requires long-lived assets and certain
          identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever
          events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
          amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of
          assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the
          carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected
          to be generated by the asset.  If such are considered to be
          impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
          amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
          fair value of the assets.  Assets to be disposed of are reported
          at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to
          sell.

         (g) Land Inventories

          Land inventories are carried at cost and consist of property
          located in Lee County, Florida and owned by Alico-Agri, Ltd.,
          and residential lots in Polk County, Florida and owned by
          Saddlebag.  The Lee County property is held for sale as commercial
          real estate.

         (h) Other Investments

          Other investments are carried at cost which primarily includes
          stock owned in agricultural cooperatives.  The Company uses
          cooperatives to process and sell sugarcane and citrus.
          Cooperatives typically require members to acquire ownership
          as a term of use of its services.

         (i) Income Taxes
          ____________

          The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
          liability method.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and
          liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
          attributable to differences between the financial statement
          carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
          respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
          measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
          income in the years in which those temporary differences are
          expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax
          assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
          income in the period that includes the enactment date.

         (j) Net Earnings Per Share
          ________________________

          Outstanding stock options issued by the Company represent
          the only dilutive effect reflected in the computation of weighted
          average shares outstanding assuming dilution.  Options do not impact
          the numerator of the earnings per share computation.







          There were no stock options that could potentially dilute basic
          earnings per share in the future that were not included in the
          computation of earnings per share assuming dilution.

         (k) Cash Flows
          __________

          For purposes of the cash flows, cash and cash investments include
          cash on hand and amounts due from financial institutions with an
          original maturity of less than three months.

         (l)  Use of Estimates
          ________________

          In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is
          required to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported
          amounts of assets and liabilities.  Actual results could differ
          significantly from those estimates.  Although some variability is
          inherent in these estimates, management believes that the amounts
          provided are adequate.  The valuation of the Company's inventories
          and the recognition of citrus and sugarcane revenues are two of the
          more significant estimates made by Management.

         (m)  Financial Instruments and Accruals
          __________________________________

          The carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheets for
          accounts receivable, mortgage and notes receivable, accounts
          payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value, because
          of the immediate or short term maturity of these items.
          The carrying amounts reported for the Company's long-term
          debts approximate fair value because they are arms length
          transactions with commercial lenders at market interest rates.

          (n) Derivative and Hedging Instruments
          __________________________________

          The Company engages in cattle futures trading activities for the
          purpose of economically hedging against price fluctuations. The
          Company records gains and losses related to economic hedges in
          costs of goods sold.  At August 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had
          no open positions.

         (o) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
         ______________________________________

         Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of
         a business enterprise during a period from transactions and
         other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.
         It includes both net income and other comprehensive income.
         Items included in other comprehensive income are classified
         based on their nature. The total of other comprehensive income
         for a period has been transferred to an equity account and
         displayed as "accumulated other comprehensive income".







         (p) Stock-Based Compensation
         ________________________

         The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
         "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25) for stock
         options and other stock-based awards while disclosing pro forma
         net income and net income per share as if the fair value method
         had been applied in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
         Standards No. 123,"Accounting for Stock-based Compensation"
        (SFAS 123)and amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
         No. 148 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and
         Disclosure".

        (q) Reportable Segments
        _________________

        The Company has three reportable segments: citrus, sugarcane, and
        ranch.  The citrus segment produces fruit for both the fresh
        fruit and processed juice markets.  The sugarcane segment produces
        sugarcane for processing.  The ranch segment raises beef cattle to be
        sold in the wholesale market.

        The Company's reportable segments are strategic business units that
        offer different products.  They are managed separately because each
        business requires different operating strategies.

       (r) Reclassifications
        _________________

        Certain amounts from 2002 and 2001 have been reclassified to conform

     be paid quarterly.  The outstanding debt under these agreements was

(7)  Commitments and Contingencies
     _____________________________

     The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising
     in the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management,
     the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material
     adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position,
     results of operation or liquidity.

(8)  Other non-current liability
     ___________________________

     Alico formed a wholly owned insurance subsidiary, Agri Insurance
     Company, Ltd. (Bermuda) ("Agri") in June of 2000.  Agri was formed in
     response to the lack of insurance availability, both in the traditional
     commercial insurance markets and governmental sponsored insurance
     programs, suitable to provide coverages for the increasing number and
     potential severity of agricultural related events.  Such events include
     citrus canker, crop diseases, livestock related maladies and weather.
     Alico's goal included not only prefunding its potential exposures
     related to the aforementioned events, but also to attempt to attract
     new underwriting capital if it is successful in profitably
     underwriting its own potential risks as well as similar risks of its
     historic business partners.  Alico primarily utilized its inventory of
     land and additional contributed capital to bolster the underwriting
     capacity of Agri.  As Agri has converted certain of the assets
     contributed by Alico to cash, book and tax differences have arisen
     resulting from differing viewpoints related to the tax treatment of
     insurance companies for federal and state tax purposes.  Due to the
     historic nature of the primary assets contributed as capital to Agri
     and the timing of the sales of certain of those assets by Agri,
     management has decided to record a contingent liability, providing
     for potential differences in the tax treatment of sales of Agri's
     assets.  Management's decision has been influenced by perceived
     changes in the regulatory environment.










(9)  Stock Option Plan
     __________

     On November 3, 1998, the Company adopted the Alico, Inc., Incentive
     Equity Plan ("The Plan") pursuant to which the Board of Directors of the
     Company may grant options, stock appreciation rights, and/or restricted
     stock to certain directors and employees.  The Plan authorizes grants of
     shares or options to purchase up to 650,000 shares of authorized but
     unissued common stock.  Stock options have vesting schedules which
     are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and determined on
     the effective date of the grant.

     All stock options granted, except as noted in the paragraph below,
     have been granted to directors or employees with an exercise price
     equal to the fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant,
     and a vesting period of one year.

     The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 for issuances to directors and
     employees in accounting for its Plan. No compensation cost was recognized
     in the consolidated financial statements through August 31, 2001, as
     options were issued at or above fair value.  On September 9, 1999, the
     Company granted 14,992 stock options with an exercise price of $14.62 and
     a fair value of $15.813.  The Company recorded $18 thousand of unearned
     compensation at the date of the grant.  On September 12, 2000, the
     Company granted an additional 51,074 stock options with an exercise price
     of $14.62 and a fair value of $16.313.  The Company recorded $86 thousand
     of unearned compensation at the date of the grant.

     On September 11, 2001, the Company granted an additional 69,598
     stock options with an exercise price of $15.68 and a fair value of
     $28.48.  The Company recorded $891 thousand of unearned compensation at
     the date of the grant.  On September 10, 2002, the Company granted an
     additional 67,280 stock options with an exercise price of $15.68 and a
     fair value of $28.15.  The Company recorded $839 thousand of unearned
     compensation at the date of the grant.

     Had the Company determined compensation cost based on the fair value
     at the grant date for its stock options under SFAS No. 123, the
     Company's net income would have changed to the pro forma amounts
     indicated below (in thousands):

     Some items of revenue and expense included in the statement of operations
     may not be currently taxable or deductible on the income tax returns.
     Therefore, income tax assets and liabilities are divided into a current
     portion, which is the amount attributable to the current year's tax
     return, and a deferred portion, which is the amount attributable to
     another year's tax return.  The revenue and expense items not currently
     taxable or deductible are called temporary differences.






















     The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
     portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are
     presented below (in thousands):

     Based on the Company's history of taxable earnings and its
     expectations for the future, management has determined that its
     taxable income will more likely than not be sufficient to fully
     recognize all deferred tax assets.

     Agri Insurance Company, Ltd. (Agri), a wholly owned insurance
     company subsidiary of Alico, is treated as a U.S. taxpayer,
     pursuant to an election under Internal Revenue Code Section 953
     (d), for all purposes except for consolidating an operating loss
     by virtue of the dual consolidated loss rules.  (Dual consolidated
     losses prevent operating losses (not capital losses) from
     occurring in insurance companies domiciled outside of the United
     States from offsetting operating income irrespective of the fact
     that the insurance company is a member of the consolidated return
     group.)







     Agri was established to provide agricultural insurance that falls
     outside of the Federal Crop Insurance Program, for catastrophic
     perils.  Agri was domiciled in Bermuda because it offers easy
     access to reinsurance markets.

     Agri issued its initial policy in August 2000 to a third party.
     Agri's ability to underwrite insurance risks has been limited
     to its operational liquidity, by the Registrar of Companies in
     Bermuda.  Agri will be able to underwrite additional insurance
     as its liquidity is increased from additional asset sales and as
     payments are received on prior sales.  For Federal income tax
     purposes, only premiums received by Agri from policies of
     insurance issued to parties other than its parent, Alico, are
     considered insurance premiums.  The preceding limiting factors
     resulted in Agri not incurring a tax liability on underwriting
     profits or investment income.  Agri's tax status resulted in
     it filing its Federal tax return on a stand alone basis for the
     calendar year periods ending December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.

     The Internal Revenue Service has notified the Company of its
     intent to examine the Company tax returns for the years ended
     August 31, 2001 and 2002.  Any adjustments resulting from the
     examination will be currently due and payable.  No adjustments
     have been proposed to date.

(12) Related Party Transactions
     __________________________

     Citrus
     ______

     Citrus revenues of $17.7 million, $19.1 million and $19.9 million were
     recognized for a portion of citrus crops sold under a marketing
     agreement with Ben Hill Griffin, Inc. (Griffin) for the years
     ended August 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  Griffin and
     its subsidiaries is the owner of approximately 49.52 percent of
     the Company's common stock.  Accounts receivable, resulting from
     citrus sales, include amounts due from Griffin totaling
     $6.5 million at both August 31, 2003 and 2002.  These amounts represent
     estimated revenues to be received periodically under pooling agreements
     as sale of pooled products is completed.

     Harvesting, marketing, and processing costs, related to the citrus sales
     noted above, totaled $6.6 million, $7.1 million, and $7.6 million for the
     years ended August 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  In addition,
     Griffin provided the harvesting services for citrus sold to unrelated
     processors. The aggregate cost of these services was $2.1 million,
     $2.0 million and $2.2 million for the years ended August 31, 2003, 2002
     and 2001, respectively.  The accompanying consolidated balance sheets
     include accounts payable to Griffin for citrus production, harvesting
     and processing costs in the amount of $435 thousand and $594 thousand
     at August 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.









     Other Transactions
     __________________

     The Company purchased fertilizer and other miscellaneous supplies,
     services, and operating equipment from Griffin, on a competitive bid
     basis, for use in its cattle, sugarcane, sod and citrus operations.
     Such purchases totaled $6.4 million, $6.2 million and $6.0 million
     during the years ended August 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

     Griffin purchased catastrophic business interruption coverage from Agri
     during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001.  The total coverage under the policy
     was $3.5 million, $3.2 million and $3.2 million for the fiscal years
     2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  The policy renews annually in
     December for a one year term.  The premiums charged under this policy
     were $138 thousand, $128 thousand and $114 thousand for 2003, 2002 and
     2001, respectively.

(13) Future Application of Accounting Standards
     __________________________________________
     In May 2003 the FASB issued SFAS 150 "Accounting for Certain Financial
     Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" This
     Statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures
     certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities
     and equity.  It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument
     that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some
     circumstances).  The remaining provisions of this Statement are
     consistent with the Board's proposal to revise that definition to
     encompass certain obligations that a reporting entity can or must settle
     by issuing its own equity shares, depending on the nature of the
     relationship established between the holder and the issuer.  This
     Statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified
     after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the
     first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, except for
     mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities.  It
     is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an
     accounting principle for financial instruments created before the
     issuance date of the Statement and still existing at the beginning of
     the interim period of adoption.  Restatement is not permitted.  The
     adoption of this Statement is not expected to have a significant impact
     on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.

     In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
     Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities."
     Interpretation No. 46 requires unconsolidated variable interest entities
     to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not
     effectively disperse the risks and rewards of ownership among their
     owners and other parties involved. The provisions of Interpretation No.
     46 are applicable immediately to all variable interest entities created
     after January 31, 2003 and variable interest entities in which an enter-
     prise obtains an interest after that date, and for variable interest
     entities created before that date, the provisions are effective July 1,
     2003. The adoption of Interpretation No. 46 is not expected to have a
     material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, or
     liquidity of the Company.







(14) Recovery of Citrus Canker Eradication Costs in Excess of Basis
     ______________________________________________________________

     The Company incurred losses during the year ended August 31, 2001
     related to citrus canker eradication.  The eradication program
     called for the removal of 507 acres of citrus trees from a grove
     in Hendry County, Florida.  While the trees were insured under the
     Federal Crop Insurance Program, additional relief funding was available
     and secured by the Company from both Federal and State government
     sources.  A summary of the recovery sources, related basis of the trees
     removed and the crop inventory losses are summarized (in thousands)

                       CODE OF ETHICS AND WHISTLEBLOWER POLICY

ALICO, INC.

CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS

Preamble

Our Company has always insisted that our employees, officers and directors
maintain the highest level of integrity in their dealings with each other and
with the public on behalf of the Company. This Code of Ethics (this "Code") is
intended to document some of the specific principles of conduct and ethics
which will be followed by our directors, officers and employees in the
performance of their responsibilities with respect to the Company's business.

Its purpose is to:

     Promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
     actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
     professional relationships;

     Promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure to the
     public including our periodic reports required to be filed with the
     Securities Exchange Commission;

     Promote compliance with applicable governmental rules and regulations;

     Provide guidance to directors, officers and employees to help them
     recognize and deal with ethical issues;

     Provide a mechanism to report unethical conduct;

     Help foster a culture of honesty and accountability.

Our directors have committed that they will comply at all times with the
principles set forth in this Code and they expect each of our Officers and
employees to do likewise.  A violation is grounds for disciplinary action up
to and including discharge and possible legal prosecution.

Article I.	Ethical Conduct

Each director, officer  and employee of the Company will at all times deal
fairly with our customers, suppliers, partners, stockholders and employees,
and will conduct business activities and operations in an ethical manner and
in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, Company policies
and the standards set forth in this Code.

Each director, officer and employee must:











Avoid all conflicts of interest between his or her personal and professional
relationships; provided, however, that if the best interests of the Company
dictate that the Company engage in a business situation which places or
appears to place a director, officer or employee in a conflict of interest
situation such conflict or potential conflict must be immediately and fully
disclosed to the Company's Board of Directors prior to any commitment by the
Company with respect thereto and the conflict should be dealt with in
accordance with our Board's procedures for handling disclosed potential
conflicts as set forth in Article III below;

provide, or cause to be provided, full, fair, accurate, timely and
understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with,
or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other
public communications made by the Company;

comply, and take reasonable actions to encourage others within the Company to
comply, with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;

promptly report violations of this Code as required and specified in the
Reporting Procedures developed by our Audit Committee a copy of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit A.; and

promote accountability for adherence to this Code.

Our Company records must at all times be prepared accurately and maintained
properly, in accordance with our records management policies and all
applicable laws, rules and regulations.  No false, artificial or deceptive
entries may be made in the Company's records for any reason.  The simple rule
of thumb is that the Company's books must accurately reflect the transactions
they record.  In addition, it is important to remember that the Company
records belong to the Company.  Therefore, the Company records should not be
removed from the Company property except for a legitimate business reason, and
any documents so removed should be returned to the Company's property as soon
as practical.  Accounting procedures and controls are prescribed by Company
policies.  Within these policies, the senior officers of our Company have the
primary responsibility for establishing and monitoring adequate systems of
internal accounting and controls in accordance with sound accounting
principles, and all employees must adhere to these controls.  The Company's
auditors will be asked from time to time to monitor and report upon these
internal controls.  Our employees are required to cooperate completely and
forthrightly with the Company's internal and independent auditors.
No employee, officer or director may engage in, allow or conceal any financial
or bookkeeping irregularity.

Article II.	Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations

Our employees must comply, at all times and in all material respects, with all
applicable laws, rules and regulations.

Our directors, officers and employees who are in possession of material, non-
public information must refrain from (i) buying or selling securities, either
personally or on behalf of others on the basis of such information, (ii)
using such information for personal gain or (iii) disclosing such information








to anyone outside the Company who does not require such information for
business purposes in the performance of their services to the Company and
agrees to abide by our non use and non selective disclosure policies.
Material, non-public information is factual information that a reasonable
investor would want to know before making an investment decision to buy or
sell our securities which has not been disclosed to the public.

Article III.	Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest and Board Procedures
                  for Resolution of the same.

Directors, officers and employees have a primary business responsibility to
the Company and must take all reasonable actions necessary to avoid conflicts
of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest.  A conflict of interest
occurs when an individual's private interest is detrimental to the interests of
the Company as a whole.  Examples of situations involving a conflict of
interest include but are not limited to:

     (i) conducting business with a firm owned, partially owned or controlled
         by a director, officer, or employee or a relative of such person;

    (ii) owning a financial interest in Alico's vendors, customers, or
         competitors (ownership of less than 1% of the stock of a publicly
         traded company that competes or does business with our Company is
         permissible);

   (iii) performing work, with  or without compensation, for a competitor,
         governmental or regulatory entity, customer or supplier of our
         Company, or doing any work for a third party that may adversely
         affect your performance or judgment on the job or diminish your
         ability to devote the necessary time and attention to your duties;

    (iv) using Company property, materials, supplies funds or other resources
         for personal purposes.  These situations and others like them, where
         loyalties to our Company could be compromised, must be avoided.  If
         you believe that you are involved in a potential conflict of interest,
         you must discuss it with your supervisor and report it to our chief
         legal officer.

The chief legal officer shall file a report with our Board of Directors of any
reported conflicts or potential conflicts which shall include a statement as
to the resolution if any of such conflict.  Conflicts which are unresolved or
which otherwise need to be considered by our Board should be placed upon the
agenda for the next Board meeting. If the potential conflict involves a member
of our Board of Directors, such member shall abstain from participating in the
resolution of such conflict by the Board or any special committee to which the
Board may refer such matter.  Disclosed conflicts of interest or potential
conflicts of interest will not be considered to violate our conflicts policy
if and only if our Board less any member who may have a conflict of interest
with regard to the matter under consideration or a special independent








committee of our board to whom review of such conflict has been referred, has
determined that the activity which gives rise to the disclosed conflict of
interest or potential conflict of interest is none-the-less in the best
interest of the Company and is fair to the Company and its stockholders.

Article IV.	Corporate Opportunities

No director, officer or employee shall:

     (i) take for himself or herself personally any opportunity of which he or
         she becomes aware through the use of Company property, information or
         position when such opportunity could be of benefit or interest to the
         Company;

    (ii) make it possible for others to take any opportunity of which he or
         she becomes aware through the use of Company property, information or
         position when such opportunity could be of benefit or interest to the
         Company, unless the Company has expressly decided not to attempt to
         take such opportunity;

   (iii) use Company property, information or position for personal gain; or

    (iv) compete with the Company in any way.

Article V.	Confidentiality

Directors, officers and employees must maintain inviolable confidentiality of
all information entrusted to them by the Company, unless disclosure is
authorized by the Company or legally required.  Confidential information
includes all information relating to the Company that may be of use to the
Company's competitors that is not otherwise public information or information
that has been entrusted to the Company by its customers, vendors or others
that have a relationship with the Company.  Directors, officers and employees
shall comply with all confidentiality policies adopted by the Company from
time to time, and with confidentiality provisions contained in agreements to
which they or the Company is a party.

Article VI.	Company Assets

Directors, officers and employees shall take reasonable steps to protect the
Company's assets and ensure their efficient use, and directors, officers and
employees shall use the Company's assets only for the Company's legitimate
business purposes.

Article VII.	Reporting Violations

The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has established many options for
any director, officer and employee seeking compliance advice or reporting
misconduct or violations of this Code of Ethics. You can contact your
supervisor; our chief legal officer; the chairman of our Audit Committee,
Richard C. Ackert (telephone 239-896-1783); our outside legal counsel,
David C. Shobe, Esq., Fowler White Boggs Banker P.A., 501 East Kennedy Blvd.,
Suite 1700, Tampa, Florida 33602; or you can place a report to our specially
designated Compliance Reporting Post Office Box 339, LaBelle, Florida, on an







identified or anonymous basis or  call our Compliance Hotline at 877-778-5463
which is staffed by independent third parties. The procedures for handling
compliance reports and questions as adopted by the Audit Committee from time
to time are attached to this Code as Exhibit A.

Anyone who seeks advice, raises a concern or reports misconduct or a violation
of this Code is following the requirements of this Code and the desires of our
Board of Directors.  We encourage such action.  Call our Compliance Hotline if
you have reason to believe there is a problem.  Retaliation against anyone who
makes a good faith report of misconduct is illegal and will not be tolerated.
We will take appropriate disciplinary action, including severance from the
Company, against any individuals engaging in improper retaliatory conduct.

Article VIII.	Amendment to, or Waiver of, this Code

Any amendment to, or waiver of, any provision of this Code with regard to any
director, officer or employee must be approved by the Board.  In the event
that members of the Board will be personally affected by a waiver of this Code,
such waiver shall be approved by a committee consisting entirely of members of
the Board who will not be personally affected by such waiver.

No amendment to, or waiver of, this Code will be effective until the waiver
has been reported to the person responsible for the preparation and filing of
the Company's current reports on Form 8-K, in sufficient detail to enable such
person to accurately disclose such amendment or waiver in the current report
on Form 8-K if necessary.  The Company shall promptly disclose on Form 8-K, by
means of filing such form with the SEC, any amendment to, or waiver of, this
Code that applies to the Company's directors or executive officers.

CONFER CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS OF ANY KIND UPON ANY EMPLOYEE OR THIRD PARTY OR

Regarding Financial Statement or other Disclosures, Accounting,
Internal Accounting or Disclosure Controls, Auditing Matters or Violations
of the Alico, Inc., Code of Business  Ethics and Conduct



Section 301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors of Alico, Inc. (the "Company") to establish procedures for:
     (a) the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints received by the
         Company regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or
         auditing matters; and

     (b) the submission by employees of the Company and others, on a
         confidential and anonymous basis, of good faith concerns regarding
         questionable accounting or auditing matters.







In accordance with Section 301, the Audit Committee has adopted the following
procedures:

     1. The Company shall promptly forward to the Audit Committee any
        complaints that it has received regarding financial statement
        disclosures, accounting, internal accounting or disclosure controls or
        auditing matters, disclosure violations or violations of our Code of
        Business Conduct and Ethics.

     2. Any employee of the Company may submit, on a confidential, anonymous
        basis if the employee so desires, any good faith concerns regarding
        financial statement or other disclosure, accounting, internal
        accounting or disclosure controls, auditing matters or violations of
        the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. All such concerns
        shall be set forth in writing and forwarded in a sealed envelope to
        the chairman of the Audit Committee, in care of the Company's Chief
        Legal Officer, L. Craig Simmons, in an envelope labeled with a legend
        such as: "To be opened by the Audit Committee only.  Being submitted
        pursuant to the "whistleblower policy" adopted by the Audit
        Committee." If an employee would like to discuss any matter with the
        Audit Committee, the employee should indicate this in the submission
        and include a telephone number at which he or she might be contacted
        if the Audit Committee deems it appropriate. Any such envelopes
        received by the Company's Chief Legal Officer shall be forwarded
        promptly and unopened to the chairman of the Audit Committee.  If the
        employee would prefer an alternative method of contact, the employee
        may contact our "Employee Whistleblower Hotline" using the contact
        information set forth below or may mail a complaint as indicated above
        to our Employer Whistleblower post office box using the address listed
        below.

     3. Following the receipt of any complaints submitted hereunder, the Audit
        Committee will investigate each matter so reported and take corrective
        and disciplinary actions, if appropriate, which may include, alone or
        in combination, a warning or letter of reprimand, demotion, loss of
        merit increase, bonus or stock options, suspension without pay or
        termination of employment.

     4. The Audit Committee may enlist committee members, employees of the
        Company and/or outside legal, accounting or other advisors, as
        appropriate, to conduct any investigation of complaints regarding
        financial statement disclosures, disclosure concerns or violations,
        accounting, internal accounting controls, auditing matters or
        violations of the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. In
        conducting any investigation, the Audit Committee shall use reasonable
        efforts to protect the confidentiality and anonymity of the
        complainant.

     5. The Company does not permit retaliation of any kind against employees
        for complaints submitted hereunder that are made in good faith.
        Additionally, no employee shall be adversely affected because the
        employee refuses to carry out a directive which, in fact, constitutes
        corporate fraud, or is a violation of state or federal law or the
        Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.







     6. The Audit Committee shall retain as a part of the records of the Audit
        Committee any such complaints or concerns for a period of no less than
        seven (7) years.

     7. Problems or concerns related to financial statement or other
        disclosures, accounting, internal or disclosure controls, auditing
        matters or questions, disclosure violations or violations of the
        Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which an employee wishes
        to discuss or report on a non-confidential or non-anonymous basis
        should be reported immediately to the company's Chief Legal Officer
        using the contact information specified below or if the employee is
        uncomfortable reporting to such person, the Company's outside legal
        counsel using the contact information specified below.

written record of all such reports or inquiries and make monthly reports of
the same to the Chairman of the Audit Committee in any month in which an
inquiry or complaint is received by them.  If the contact is in the nature of
an alleged violation of the Company's Code of Conduct and Ethics or an
impropriety with regard to the Company's financial statements or other
disclosures, accounting, internal or disclosure controls, or auditing matters,

Company's outside legal counsel to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, who
