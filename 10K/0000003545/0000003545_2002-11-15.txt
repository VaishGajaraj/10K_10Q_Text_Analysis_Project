                          PART I
                          ______

Item 1.          Business.
__________________________

Alico, Inc. (the "Company") is generally recognized as an
agribusiness company operating in Central and Southwest
Florida.  The Company's primary asset is 140,526 acres of land
located in Collier, Hendry, Lee and Polk Counties. (See table
on Page 7 for location and acreage by current primary use.)
The Company is involved in various operations and activities
including citrus fruit production, cattle ranching, sugarcane
and sod production, and forestry.  The Company also leases land
for farming, cattle grazing, recreation, and oil exploration.

The Company's land is managed for multiple use wherever
possible.  Cattle ranching, forestry and land leased for farm-
ing, grazing,recreation and oil exploration, in some instances,
utilize the same acreage.

Agricultural operations have combined to produce from 69 to 89
percent of annual revenues during the past five years.  Citrus
groves generate the most gross revenue.  Sugarcane ranks second
in revenue production.  While the cattle ranching operation
utilizes the largest acreage, it ranks third in the production
of revenue.  Approximately 9,197 acres of the Company's
property are classified as timberlands, however, the area in
which these lands are located is not highly rated for timber
production.  These lands are also utilized as native range, in
the ranching operation, and leased out for recreation and oil
exploration.

Diversification of the Company's agricultural base was
initiated with the development of a Sugarcane Division at the
end of the 1988 fiscal year. The 11,680 acres in production
during the 2002 fiscal year consisted of 1,520 acres planted
in 1997, 3,326 acres planted in 1998, 4,152 acres planted in
1999 and 2,682 acres planted in 2000.

Leasing of lands for rock mining and oil and mineral explor-
ation, rental of land for grazing, farming, recreation and
other uses, while not classified as agricultural operations,
are important components of the Company's land utilization and
operation.  Gross revenue from these activities during the
past five years has ranged from 4 to 5 percent of total
revenue.


<PAGE>
The Company is not in the retail land sales and development
business, except through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Saddlebag Lake Resorts, Inc..  However,it does from time to
time sell properties which, in the judgment of management,
are surplus to the Company's primary operations.  Additionally,
the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Agri-Insurance Company,
Ltd., engages in bulk land sales in connection with the gene-
ration of underwriting capital.  Gains from sales of real
estate during the past five years has ranged from 3 to 23 per-
cent of total revenues.

For further discussion of the relative importance of the
various segments of the Company's operations, including finan-
cial information regarding revenues, operating profits (losses)
and assets attributable to each major segment of the Company's
business, see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial State-
ments and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" included elsewhere in this
document.


Subsidiary Operations
_____________________

The Company has two wholly owned subsidiaries; Saddlebag Lake
Resorts, Inc. ("Saddlebag") and Agri-Insurance Company, Ltd.
("Agri").  Saddlebag has been active in the subdividing, deve-
lopment and sale of real estate since its inception in 1971.
Saddlebag has two subdivisions near Frostproof, Florida which
have been developed and are on the market.  While one of the
subdivisions has been sold out, approximately 62% of the lots
in the second development have been sold.

Agri, formed during fiscal 2000, was created to write crop
insurance against catastrophic losses due to weather and
disease.  During fiscal 2002, Agri supplied reinsurance to an
independent underwriter who insured catastrophic business
interruption coverage for Ben Hill Griffin, Inc.. The total
coverage under the policy was $3.2 million and the premium
charged was $128 thousand.  The coverage term was from Decem-
ber 2001 to December 2002. The Company expects to renew the
policy and appropriately adjust premium rates.  Additionally,
Agri directly underwrote catastrophic business interruption
coverage for its parent company, Alico, Inc., insuring all
of Alico's citrus groves.  The coverage term was from August
31, 2002 to August 2003.  Total coverage under the policy was
$12.7 million and the premium charged was $803 thousand.


<PAGE>
The financial results of the operation of these subsidiaries
are consolidated with those of the Company.  (See Note 1 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)


Citrus
______

Approximately 9,756 acres of citrus were harvested during the
2001/02 season. Since 1983 the Company has maintained a mar-
keting contract covering the majority of the Company's citrus
crop with Ben Hill Griffin, Inc., a Florida corporation and
major shareholder.  The agreement provides for modifications
to meet changing market conditions and provides that either
party may terminate the contract by giving notice prior to the
first day of August preceding each fruit season.  Under the
terms of the contract,  the Company's fruit is packed and/or
processed and sold along with fruit from other growers,
including Ben Hill Griffin, Inc.  The proceeds are distributed
on a pro rata basis as the finished product is sold. During the
year ended August 31, 2002, approximately 77% of the Company's
fruit crop was marketed under this agreement, the same percen-
tage as in the year ended August 31, 2001.  In addition, Ben
Hill Griffin, Inc. provides harvesting services to the Company
for citrus sold to unrelated processors.  These sales accounted
for the remaining 23% of total citrus revenue for the year.
For the year ended August 31, 2000, approximately 76% of the
Company's fruit crop was marketed under this agreement.

Ranch
______

The Company has a cattle operation located in Hendry and
Collier Counties, Florida which is engaged primarily in the
production of beef cattle and the raising of replacement
heifers.  The breeding herd consists of approximately 13,755
cows, bulls and replacement heifers.  Approximately 47% of the
herd are from one to five years old, while the remaining 53%
are six and older.  The Company primarily sells to packing and
processing plants.  The Company also sells cattle through
local livestock auction markets and to contract cattle buyers.
These buyers provide ready markets for the Company's cattle.
The loss of any one or a few of these plants and/or buyers
would not, in management's view, have a material adverse effect
on the Company's cattle operation.  Subject to prevailing
market conditions, the Company may hedge its beef inventory by
entering into cattle futures contracts to reduce exposure to
changes in market prices.

<PAGE>
Sugarcane
_________

The Company had 11,680 acres, 11,722 acres, and 9,588 acres of
sugarcane in production during the 2001/02,2000/01, and 1999/00
fiscal years, respectively.  The 2001/02, 2000/01, and 1999/00
crops yielded approximately 376,000, 417,000, and 321,000 gross
tons, respectively.

Forest Products
_______________

Approximately 7% of the Company's properties are classified as
timberlands. The principal forest products sold by the Company
are sabal palms and other horticultural commodities.  These
products are sold to various landscaping companies.  The
Company does not incur any of the harvesting expenses.

Part of the lands, from which the timber was removed, is being
converted to semi-improved pasture and other uses.

Land Rental for Grazing, Agricultural and Other Uses
____________________________________________________

The Company rents land to others for grazing, farming and
recreational uses, on a tenant-at-will basis, for an annual
fee.  The income is not significant when compared to overall
gross income, however, it does help to offset the expense of
carrying these properties until they are put to a more profit-
able use.  The Company has developed additional land to lease
for farming.

There were no significant changes in the method of rental for
these purposes during the past fiscal year.

Leases for Oil and Mineral Exploration
______________________________________

The Company has leased subsurface rights to a portion of its
properties for the purpose of oil and mineral exploration.
Currently, there are two leases in effect.

Twenty-four wells have been drilled during the years that the
Company has been leasing subsurface rights to oil companies.
The drilling has resulted in twenty-one dry holes, one marginal
producer, which has been abandoned,and two average producers,
still producing.


<PAGE>
Mining Operations: Rock and Sand
_________________________________

The Company leases 6,143 acres in Lee County, Florida to CSR
America,Inc. of West Palm Beach, Florida for mining and
production of rock, aggregate, sand, baserock and other road
building and construction materials.

Royalties which the company receives for these products are
based on a percentage of the F.O.B. plant sales price.

Competition
___________

As indicated, the Company is primarily engaged in a limited
number of agricultural activities, all of which are highly
competitive.  For instance, citrus is grown in several states,
the most notable of which are: Florida, California, Arizona
and Texas.  In addition, citrus and sugarcane products are im-
ported from some foreign countries.  Beef cattle are produced
throughout the United States and domestic beef sales must also
compete with sales of imported beef.  Additionally, forest and
rock products are produced in most parts of the United States.
Leasing of land for oil exploration is also widespread.

The Company's share of the market for citrus, sugarcane, cattle
and forest products in the United States is insignificant.

Environmental Regulations
_________________________

The Company's operation is subject to various federal, state
and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment.  The Company is in compliance with all such rules
and such compliance has not had a material effect upon capital
expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the
Company.

While compliance with environmental regulations has not had a
material economic effect on the Company's operations, execu-
tive officers are required to spend a considerable amount of
time keeping current on these matters.  In addition, there are
ongoing costs incurred in complying with the permitting and
reporting requirements.




<PAGE>

Employees
_________

At the end of August 2002, the Company had a total of 152 full-
time employees classified as follows:  Citrus 73; Ranch 19;
Sugarcane 16; Facilities Maintenance Support 27; General and
Administrative 17.  There are no employees engaged in the deve-
lopment of new products or research.  Management is not aware
of any efforts by employees or outside organizers to create any
type of labor union arrangement.  Management believes that the
employer/employee relationship environment is such that labor
organization activities are unlikely to occur.

Seasonal Nature of Business
___________________________

As with any agribusiness enterprise, the Company's business
operations are predominantly seasonal in nature.  The harvest
and sale of citrus fruit generally occurs from October to June.
Sugarcane is harvested during the first, second and third quar-
ters.  Other segments of the Company's business such as its
cattle and sod sales, and its timber, mining and leasing oper-
ations, tend to be more successive than seasonal in nature.


Item 2.          Properties.
____________________________

At August 31, 2002, the Company owned a total of 140,526 acres
of land located in four counties in Florida.  Acreage in each
county and the primary classification with respect to present
use of these properties is shown in the following table:

</TABLE>














<PAGE>
Of the above lands, the Company utilizes 24,178 acres of imp-
roved pasture plus approximately 46,000 acres of native pasture
for cattle production and 6,143 acres are leased for rock
mining operations.  Much of the land is also leased for multi-
purpose use such as cattle grazing, oil exploration,
agriculture and recreation.

In addition to the land shown in the above table, the Company
owns full subsurface rights to 1,064 acres and fractional sub-
surface rights to 18,707 acres located throughout the Counties
referred to above.

From the inception of the Company's initial development program
in 1948, the goal has been to develop the lands for the most
profitable use.  Prior to implementation of the development
program, detailed studies were made of the properties focusing
on soil capabilities, topography, transportation, availability
of markets and the climatic characteristics of each of the
tracts.  Based on these and later studies, the use of each
tract was determined.  It is the opinion of Management that the
lands are suitable for agricultural, residential and commercial
uses.  However, since the Company is primarily engaged in agri-
cultural activities, some of the lands are considered surplus
to its needs for this purpose and, as indicated under Item 1 of
this report, sales of real property are made from time to time.

Management believes that each of the major programs is
adequately supported by agricultural equipment, buildings,
fences, irrigation systems and other amenities required for the
operation of the projects.

Item 3.          Legal Proceedings.
___________________________________

The Company has been informed by Ben Hill Griffin III, Chairman
of the Board, that he is party to a lawsuit filed against him
in Polk County, Florida Circuit Court by the families of his
four sisters, most of the members of whom are beneficiaries of
a trust, entitled the Ben Hill Griffin, Jr. Revocable Inter
Vivos Trust #1 (the "Trust"). The plaintiffs in the lawsuit
(The Four Sisters Protectorate, et al. v. Ben Hill Griffin,
III, Trustee, Case No. GC-G-0054, Section 81) sought to impose
judicial sanctions on Mr. Griffin III, including his removal
as Trustee of the Trust based on allegations of over-compen-
sation and receipt of an illegal bonus. On March 29, 2001,
after court-ordered mediation pending completion of which the
trial was adjourned, Mr. Griffin III and a representative of

<PAGE>


the Four Sisters Protectorate, joined by their respective
counsel, executed a "Settlement Agreement" which set forth
the basic elements of a settlement of the lawsuit, contingent
upon several events, including Internal Revenue Service
approval of the proposed transaction as a tax free split-off
for federal income tax purposes, and the Court's judicial
termination of the Trust.  The terms contained in the Settle-
ment Agreement were not intended, nor were they sufficient,
to resolve all specific items necessary to consummate a
settlement of the lawsuit. The Settlement Agreement provided
that the shares of Alico, Inc., stock then owned by Ben Hill
Griffin Investments Inc. would be utilized in the tax free
split-off, along with other assets, as a means of allocating
to the Four Sisters Protectorate assets approximating the
value of their interests in Ben Hill Griffin Investments
Inc., a holding company wholly owned by the Trust, Ben Hill
Griffin III, The Four Sisters Protectorate and its members.

Mr. Griffin III has indicated that following execution of the
Settlement Agreement the parties disagreed as to its validity
or enforceability on various grounds. On May 14, 2001, the
Harris Family filed a motion in the Circuit Court of the 10th
Judicial Circuit in and for Polk County, Florida (Case No.
GC-G-0054) seeking to have the Settlement Agreement set aside
as invalid and unenforceable. On November 2, 2001 the Court
entered a written order that the Settlement Agreement is en-
forceable. The Harris family has filed an Appeal in response
to the order.  Mr. Griffin, III has informed the Company that
the issues related to the mechanism and terms of the proposed
distribution of certain of the assets of the Trust to the
families of the four sisters, including the Alico stock bene-
ficially owned by the Trust, have been worked out between the
representatives of the four sisters and Ben Hill Griffin III,
and are set forth in a definitive separation agreement.  The
Company further understands that consummation of the settle-
ment continues to be subject to certain conditions which are
still pending, specifically, the Harris family litigation.
The Company has been informed by Mr. Griffin III that the
arties have received a favorable IRS Revenue Ruling.  Neither
the Company nor Mr. Griffin III or his attorneys know when the
settlement will be implemented, but believe related litigation
proceedings could take 6 months to a year to be resolved.

Mr. Griffin III has also informed the Company that immediately
before the hearing on the enforcement of the State court
action, lawyers for the Harris family provided Mr. Griffin
III's attorneys with copies of a federal court action naming
<PAGE>


among others as defendants, Mr. Griffin III, individually and
as Trustee of the Ben Hill Griffin, Jr., revocable Inter Vivos
Trust #1, and BHG Inc.  According to Mr. Griffin III's attor-
neys, this litigation was filed in the federal district court
for the Northern District of Florida (Case No: 4:olcv 432-5PM).
The complaint, among other things,seeks to set aside the
settlement agreement based on alleged violations of the secur-
ities laws, fraud, and negligence.  This suit was filed on
October 2, 2001.  Mr. Griffin III's attorneys have indicated
that they believe this suit is without merit, if not frivolous,
and have stated that Mr. Griffin III will defend it vigorously.

Since the Company opted out of the Florida Business Corporation
Act's provisions on Affiliated Transactions and Control Share
Acquisitions (currently FBCA s. 607.0901 and s. 607.0902) under
the predecessor statutes to such sections, transactions contem-
plated by the Settlement Agreement may not be subject to share-
holder approval or review by the Company's Board of Directors.

The Company is not a party to any of this litigation.

pay annual dividends in the immediate future; nevertheless,
there is no assurance that dividends will be paid in the future
since they are dependent upon earnings, the financial condition
of the Company, and other factors.

The following discussion focuses on the results of operations
and the financial condition of the Company.

This section should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and notes.


Liquidity and Capital Resources
_______________________________

The Company had cash and marketable securities of $31.6 million
at August 31, 2002, compared with $25.0 million at August 31,
2001.  Working capital was $56.7 million and $53.7 million at
August 31, 2002 and August 31, 2001 respectively.

Cash outlay for land, equipment, buildings, and other improve-
ments totaled $9.3 million during fiscal 2002, compared to


<PAGE>
$8.5 million during fiscal 2001 and $10.0 million during fiscal
2000, respectively. Land preparation for citrus development and
capital maintenance continued, as did expenditures for replace-
ment equipment and raising of breeding cattle.  Additional sod
acreage also was developed.

Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its
working capital requirements for the foreseeable future with
internally generated funds.  In addition, the Company has
credit commitments which provide for revolving credit of up to
$54.0 million, of which $13.0 million was available for the
Company's general use at August 31, 2002 (see Note 6 of Notes
to consolidated financial statements).

Operating Revenue
_________________

Operating revenues for fiscal 2002 decreased compared to fiscal
2001.  A decrease in revenues from agricultural activities was
the most significant factor in the decline.

Operating revenues for fiscal 2001 increased when compared to
those of fiscal 2000.  An increase in revenues from agricul-
tural activities was the most significant factor in the rise.

Income (loss) from Operations
_____________________________

Earnings from operations decreased significantly during fiscal
2002 when compared to the prior year ( $(1,127) in fiscal 2002
vs. $6,450 in fiscal 2001).  The decrease was largely impacted
by the Company's commitment to donate $5.0 million to Florida
Gulf Coast University (the University) in December 2001, for a
new athletic complex, scholarships and athletic programs.  In
accordance with the Company's agreement with the University,
$1.0 million was donated in fiscal 2002, and $800 thousand
will be donated each year over the next five years.  The
entire donation has been accrued and is included in general
and administrative expenses in the current year.  The remain-
ing decline in gross profits from operations was due to a
decline in earnings from agricultural activities.

Income from operations decreased 7% during fiscal 2001 due to
increased general and administrative expenses.

Profit on Sale of Real Estate
____________________________________

Profit from retail land sales, made through Saddlebag, were
at breakeven for fiscal 2002 and 2001.  Profit from bulk land
sales, increased from $11.4 million in fiscal 2001 to $11.6
million in fiscal 2002.

Real estate profits decreased from $13.3 million in fiscal
2000 to $11.4 million during fiscal 2001.

Interest and Investment Income
______________________________

Interest and investment income is generated principally from
investments in marketable equity securities, corporate and


<PAGE>
municipal bonds, mutual funds, U.S. Treasury securities and
mortgages held on real estate sold on the installment basis.
Realized investment earnings were reinvested throughout fiscal
2002, 2001 and 2000, increasing investment levels during each
year. The decrease in fiscal 2002 and 2001 interest and
realized and unrealized investment income resulted from unfa-
vorable financial conditions.  The rise in fiscal 2000
interest and realized and unrealized investment income
resulted from favorable market conditions during the year.

Interest Expense
________________

Interest expense declined during fiscal 2002 when compared to
fiscal 2001, as interest rates on borrowings have declined.

Interest expense increased during fiscal 2001 and 2000,
compared to each respective prior year. This was primarily due
to increased borrowings related to the acquisition of 7,680
acres of sugarcane, citrus and ranch during fiscal 1999. Total
interest cost decreased slightly in 2001 while increasing 54%
during fiscal 2000.

compared to fiscal 2001 ($25.1 million during fiscal 2002 vs.
$27.6 million during fiscal 2001).

Production decreased during fiscal 2002, compared to fiscal
2001, and was the primary cause of the decline.

Harvesting and marketing costs decreased when compared to fis-
cal 2001due to the decrease in boxes harvested during the year.
Direct production and allocated costs decreased 3% due to a de-
cline in the number of producing acres.

Revenue from citrus sales decreased 2% during fiscal 2001,
compared to fiscal 2000 ($27.6 million during fiscal 2001 vs.
$28.2 million during fiscal 2000).

Production improved during fiscal 2001, however, the average
market price decreased compared to fiscal 2000.

Harvesting and marketing costs increased in fiscal 2001 com-
pared to fiscal 2000, corresponding with an increase in boxes
harvested.  Direct production and allocated costs increased 6%
resulting from inflation and increased cultivation costs
related to replanted trees.

The final returns from citrus pools are not precisely deter-
minable at year end.  Returns are estimated each year based on
the most current information available.  Differences between
the estimates and the final realization of revenues can be sig-
nificant.  Revenues collected in excess of prior year and year
end estimates were $568 thousand, $617 thousand, and
$1.8 million during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Sugarcane
_________

Gross profit for fiscal 2002 was $2.1 million, compared to
$2.6 million in fiscal 2001 and $1.5 million in fiscal 2000.

Sales revenues from sugarcane decreased 5% during fiscal 2002,
compared to fiscal 2001 ($11.3 million vs. $11.9 million, re-
spectively).  The decline inrevenue was the result of a de-
creased yield per acre resulting from drought conditions during
the growing season.  Direct production costs decreased 2%
during fiscal 2002, compared to fiscal 2001.  However, allo-
cated costs increased 8% during 2002 over 2001 levels due to
an increase in ad valorem taxes.

Sales revenues from sugarcane increased 40% during fiscal 2001,
compared to fiscal 2000 ($11.9 million vs. $8.5 million,
respectively).  The rise in  revenue and related costs was the
result of the increase in the number of producing acres.

Ranching
________

The gross profit from ranch operations for fiscal 2002, 2001
and 2000 was $809 thousand, $1.6 million, and $739 thousand,
respectively.

Revenues from cattle sales increased 3% during fiscal 2002,
compared to fiscal 2001 ($9.6 million in fiscal 2002 vs. $9.3
million in fiscal 2001). The proportion of animals sold from
feedlots increased in the current year resulting in higher
sales weights per head and higher revenues.  The increase in
revenues was offset, however, by a 14% rise in direct and
allocated costs when compared to the prior year ($8.8 million
during fiscal 2002 and $7.7 million during fiscal 2001).

Revenues from cattle sales increased 54% during fiscal 2001,
compared to fiscal 2000 ($9.3 million in fiscal 2001 vs. $6.1
million in fiscal 2000).  The number of animals sold during
the year increased 52% over the prior year due to increased
sales of feeder cattle during the year and market prices for
beef improved.

Direct and allocated costs increased 45% when compared to the
prior year ($7.7 million during fiscal 2001 and $5.3 million
during fiscal 2000) corresponding to the increase in the
number of animals sold.


<PAGE>
The Company's cattle marketing activities include retention of
calves in western feedlots, contract and auction sales, and
risk management contracts.

Other Operations
________________

Revenues from oil royalties and land rentals were $721
thousand in fiscal 2002 as compared to $770 thousand for fis-
cal 2001 and $923 thousand for fiscal 2000.

Returns from rock products and sand were $2.0 million for fis-
cal 2002,$1.7 million for 2001 and $1.3 million during 2000.
Rock and sand supplies are sufficient to meet current demand,
and no major price changes have occurred over the past 3 years.

Profits from the sale of sabal palms and other horticultural
items, for landscaping purposes, during fiscal 2002 were $355
thousand compared to $91 thousand and $84 thousand for fiscal
years 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Direct and allocated expenses charged to the "Other" opera-
tions category included general and administrative and other
costs not charged directly to the citrus, ranching, sugarcane
divisions.  These expenses totaled $10.8 million during fiscal
2002, compared to $5.5 million during fiscal 2001 and to $4.4
million during fiscal 2000.

In December 2001, the Company agreed to donate $5.0 million to
the Florida Gulf Coast University for a new athletic complex,
scholarships and athletic programs.  As per the agreement with
the University, $1.0 million was donated in fiscal 2002, and
$800 thousand will be donated each year over the next five
years.  The net present value of the total donation was ac-
crued and included in general and administrative expenses in
fiscal 2002 and was the primary cause for the increase in
general and administrative expenses for the year.

General Corporate
_________________

The Company is continuing its marketing and permitting activi-
ties for its land which surrounds the Florida Gulf Coast Uni-
versity site.  There are sales contracts in place for more
than 5,400 acres of the Lee County, Florida property totaling
$146.0 million.  The agreements are at various stages in the
due diligence process with closing dates over the next ten
years.

<PAGE>
The Company announced the formation of Agri-Insurance Company,
Ltd. (Agri) a wholly owned subsidiary, during July of 2000.
The insurance company was initially capitalized by transfer-
ring cash and approximately 3,000 acres of the Lee County
property. Through Agri, the Company has been able to under-
write previously uninsurable risk related to catastrophic crop
and other losses.  Additionally, the insurance company will
have access to reinsurance markets, otherwise inaccessible.
The Federal Crop Insurance Program provides coverage for cer-
tain perils such as freeze damage, windstorm damage, disease,
etc. However, the current Federal Crop Insurance Program does
not provide business interruption coverage.  The coverages cur-
rently underwritten by Agri will indemnify the insured for the
loss of the revenue stream resulting from a catastrophic event
that would cause a grove to be replanted.  The insurance market
is bifurcated into direct insurers and reinsurers.  Reinsurers
provide wholesale insurance coverage to direct insurers.  Some
specialized reinsurers will only deal with insurance companies.
As a result, the only way to access the wholesale insurance
market is through the formation of a captive insurance company.
Reinsurers provide greater insurance coverage flexibility than
can be found in the primary insurance market.

Agri is a recently created entity.  It would be difficult, if
not impossible, to speculate about the impact that Agri could
have on the Company's financial position, results of
operations and liquidity in future periods.  Since the cover-
ages that will be written, as liquidity is generated, will be
primarily for the benefit of Alico, the financial substance of
this venture is to insure risk that is inherent in the
Company's existing operations.  To expedite the creation of
the capital liquidity necessary to underwrite the Company's
exposure to catastrophic losses, another 5,600 acres was trans-
ferred during fiscal 2001.  Agri underwrote a limited amount
of coverage for Ben Hill Griffin, Inc. during fiscal 2002 and
2001 and in August 31, 2002 began insuring all of the Alico,
Inc., citrus groves.  As Agri gains underwriting experience
and increases its liquidity, it will be able to increase its
insurance program.

During September of 1999, the Company announced a sale of
1,270 acres of land surrounding the University site in Lee
County for $16.5 million.  The contract called for 25 percent
of the purchase price to be paid at closing, with the balance
payable over the next four years.  In July of 2000, Agri sold
another 488 acres to the same buyer, also near the University,
for $10.6 million.  In connection with the sale, the purchaser


<PAGE>
agreed to pay off the $12.3 million mortgage related to the
September 1999 sale and pay 10% of the contract price for
their second purchase at closing, with the balance payable
over the next four years.  The first sale generated a pre-tax
gain of $13.4 million.  The gain related to the second sale
was recognized during fiscal 2000, to the extent that 10% of
the purchase price has been collected net of closing costs
($959 thousand).  The remainder of the gain and related mort-
gage were recognized during the 2001 fiscal year upon receipt
of the first annual mortgage payment which, combined with the
initial payment in fiscal 2000, exceeded 20% of the contract
price.

During November 2001, Agri began to close on a 2,500 acre,
$30.0 million sale, of which 40 acres were transferred in
November 2001 and 1,744 acres were transferred by the end of
December 2001.  However, upon mutual consent, 323 acres,
representing $9.6 million were released from the contract and
retained by Agri for sale at a future date.  The remaining 393
acres are expected to be transferred by the end of fiscal 2003.
The profits from portions of this transaction that have closed
are included in the statement of operations under gain on
sales of real estate.

Also in December 2001, the Company agreed to donate $5.0 mil-
lion to Florida Gulf Coast University for a new athletic com-
plex, scholarships and athletic programs.  The agreement
called for $1.0 million to be donated in the current fiscal
year, and $800 thousand to be donated each year over the next
five years.  The entire donation has been accrued and is in-
cluded in general and administrative expenses in the statement
of operations.

During January 2002, the Company acquired 40 acres of Lee
County, Florida property for $9.5 million.  The property is
located near one of the interstate highway access ramps to
Florida Gulf Coast University and the Southwest Florida
International Airport.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
__________________________________________
The preparation of the Company's financial statements and rela-
ted disclosures in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and judgments that affect the re-
ported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and ex-
penses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates the

<PAGE>
estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and
various other factors and circumstances. Management believes
that the estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the
circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these
estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances.
The following critical accounting policies have  been identi-
fied that affect the more significant judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements.

The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market.
Management regularly assesses estimated inventory valuations
based on current and forecasted usage of the related commodity
and any other relevant factors that affect the net realizable
value.

Based on fruit buyers' and processors' advances to growers,
stated cash and futures markets combined experience in the
industry, management reviews the reasonableness of the citrus
revenue accrual.  Adjustments are made throughout the year to
these estimates as relevant information regarding the citrus
market becomes available.  Fluctuation in the market prices
for citrus fruit has caused the Company to recognize additional
revenue from prior years' crop totaling $568 thousand, $617
thousand, and $1.8 million, during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

In accordance with Statement of Position 85-3 "Accounting by
Agricultural Producers and Agricultural Cooperatives", the
cost of growing crops (citrus and sugarcane) are capitalized
into inventory until the time of harvest.  Once a given crop
is harvested, the related inventoried costs are recognized as
a cost of sale to provide an appropriate matching of costs
incurred with the related revenue earned.

Alico formed a wholly owned insurance subsidiary, Agri
Insurance Company, Ltd. (Bermuda) ("Agri") in June of 2000.
Agri was formed in response to the lack of insurance avail-
ability, both in the traditional commercial insurance markets
and governmental sponsored insurance programs, suitable to pro-
vide coverages for the increasing number and potential
severity of agricultural related events.  Such events include
citrus canker, crop diseases, livestock related maladies and
weather.  Alico's goal included not only prefunding its poten-
tial exposures related to the aforementioned events, but also
to attempt to attract new underwriting capital if it is suc-
cessful in profitably underwriting its own potential risks as
well as similar risks of its historic business partners.

<PAGE>
Alico primarily utilized its inventory of land and additional
contributed capital to bolster the underwriting capacity of
Agri.  As Agri has converted certain of the assets contributed
by Alico to cash, book and tax differences have arisen result-
ing from differing viewpoints related to the tax treatment of
insurance companies for other federal and state tax purposes.
Due to the historic nature of the primary assets contributed
as capital to Agri and the timing of the sales of certain of
those assets by Agri, management has decided to record a
contingent liability, providing for potential differences in
the tax treatment of sales of Agri's assets in its initial
year of operation.  Management's decision has been influenced
by perceived changes in the regulatory environment.

Item 7(a).      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About
                Market Risk
______________________________________________________________

Alico's exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest
rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio.  There
are no derivative financial instruments in the investment port-
folio. Investments are placed with high quality issuers and,
by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one
issuer.  Alico is adverse to principal loss and ensures the
safety and preservation of invested funds by limiting default,
market and reinvestment risk.  The Company classifies cash
equivalents and short-term investments as fixed-rate if the
rate of return on such instruments remains fixed over their
term.  These fixed-rate investments include fixed-rate U.S.
government securities, municipal bonds, time deposits and
certificates of deposit. Cash equivalents and short-term in-
vestments are classified as variable-rate if the rate of
return on such investments varies based on the change in a pre-
determined index or set of indices during their term.  These
variable-rate investments primarily include money market ac-
counts, mutual funds and equities held at various securities
brokers and investment banks. The table below presents the
amounts (in thousands) and related weighted interest/dividend
yield rates of the investment portfolio at August 31, 2002:

                          ____________________________
The Stockholders and Board of Directors
Alico, Inc.:

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Alico, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of August 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended August 31, 2002.  In connection with our audits
of the consolidated financial statements, we also have
audited the related consolidated financial statement schedules
as listed in Item 14(a)(2) herein.  These consolidated
financial statements and financial statements schedules are
the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America.  Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Alico,Inc. and subsidiaries at August 31,
2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended August 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in
our opinion, the related consolidated financial statement
schedules, when considered in relation to the consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

		 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
           Years Ended August 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000

(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
     __________________________________________

  (a)  Basis of Consolidated Financial Statement Presentation
       ______________________________________________________

          The consolidated financial statements include the
          accounts of Alico, Inc. (the Company) and its wholly
          owned subsidiaries,Saddlebag Lake Resorts, Inc.
         (Saddlebag), and Agri Insurance Company, Ltd. (Agri),
          after elimination of all significant intercompany
          balances and transactions.

     (b)  Revenue Recognition
          ___________________

          Income from sales of citrus under marketing pool
          agreements is recognized at the time the crop is
          harvested.  Based on fruit buyers' and processors'
          advances to growers, stated cash and futures markets,
          management reviews the reasonableness of the citrus
          revenue accrual.  Adjustments are made throughout
          the year to these estimates as relevant information
          regarding the citrus market becomes available.
          Fluctuation in the market prices for citrus fruit
          has caused the Company to recognize additional
          revenue from the prior year's crop totaling $568
          thousand, $617 thousand, and $1.8 million during
          fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

          Revenue from sugarcane is recognized when the har-
          vested product is taken for processing.  The earnings
          process is complete at that time and the resulting
          revenue is determinable for the sugarcane crop as of
          year-end, therefore, no estimations are necessary.

          The Company recognizes revenue from cattle sales at
          the time the cattle are sold at auction.

     (c)  Real Estate
          ___________

          Real estate sales are recorded under the accrual
          method of accounting.  Residential retail land sales
          made through Saddlebag are not recognized until the

<PAGE>
          buyer's initial investment or cumulative payments of
          principal and interest equal or exceed 10 percent of
          the contract sales price  Commercial or bulk land
          sales,made mostly through Agri, are not recognized
          until payments received for property to be developed
          within two years after the sale equal 20%, or
          property to be developed after two years equal 25%,
          of the contract sales price.  At August 31, 2000,
          the Company did not recognize gross profit totaling
          $9.5 million related to commercial real estate which
          was sold subject to a mortgage note receivable
         (note 3).  The terms of the sale called for 10% of
          the contract price of $10.6 million to be paid at
          closing.  The $1.1 million less the land basis and
          closing costs was recognized as a gain on the sale
          of real estate totaling $288 thousand during
          August 31, 2000.

          During the year ended August 31, 2001, the purchaser
          made the first of four equal annual installments,
          required in the mortgage, totaling $2.4 million,
          plus interest.  The deferred profit on the sale was
          then recognized as 32.5 percent of the contract
          price was received and the buyer's continuing invest-
          ment became adequate to demonstrate its commitment
          to pay for the property.

          Profits from commercial real estate sales are
          discounted to reflect the market rate of interest
          where the stated rate is less than the market rate.
          The recorded valuation discounts are realized as the
          balances due are collected. In the event of early
          liquidation, interest is recognized on the simple
          interest method.

          Tangible assets that are purchased during the period
          to aid in the sale of the project as well as costs
          for services performed to obtain regulatory approval
          of the sales are capitalized as land and land im-
          provements to the extent they are estimated to be
          recoverable from the sale of the property.  Land and
          land improvement costs are allocated to individual
          parcels on a per lot basis using the relative sales
          value method.

          The Company has entered into an agreement with a
          real estate consultant to assist in obtaining the


<PAGE>
          necessary regulatory approvals for the development
          and marketing of a tract of raw land.  The marketing
          costs under this agreement are being expensed as in-
          curred.  The costs incurred to obtain the necessary
          regulatory approvals are capitalized into land costs
          when paid.  These costs will be expensed as cost of
          sales when the underlying real estate is sold.

     (d)  Marketable Securities Available for Sale
          ________________________________________

          Marketable securities available for sale are carried
          at their estimated fair value.  Net unrealized
          investment gains and losses are recorded net of
          related deferred taxes in accumulated other
          comprehensive income within stockholders' equity
          until realized.

          Fair value for debt and equity investments is based
          on quoted market prices at the reporting date for
          those or similar investments.  The cost of all
          marketable securities available for sale are deter-
          mined on the specific identification method.

     (e)  Inventories
          ___________

          The costs of growing citrus and sugarcane are
          capitalized into inventory until the time of harvest.
          Once a given crop is harvested, the related inven-
          toried costs are recognized as a cost of sale to pro-
          vide an appropriate matching of costs incurred with
          the related revenue earned.

          Beef cattle inventories are stated at the lower of
          cost or market.  The cost of the beef cattle inven-
          tory is based on the accumulated cost of developing
          such animals for sale.  Unharvested crops are stated
          at the lower of cost or market.  The cost for unhar-
          vested crops is based on accumulated production
          costs incurred during the eight month period from
          January 1 through August 31.

     (f)  Property, Buildings and Equipment
          _________________________________

          Property, buildings and equipment are stated at cost.
          Properties acquired from the Company's predecessor

<PAGE>
          corporation in exchange for common stock issued in
          1960, at the inception of the Company, are stated on
          the basis of cost to the predecessor corporation.
          Property acquired as part of a land exchange trust
          is valued at the carrying value of the property
          transferred to the trust.

          All costs related to the development of citrus
          groves, through planting, are capitalized.  Such
          costs include land clearing, excavation and construc-
          tion of ditches, dikes, roads, and reservoirs, etc.
          After the planting, caretaking costs or preproductive
          maintenance costs are capitalized for four years.
          After four years, a grove is considered to have
          reached maturity and the accumulated costs, except
          for land excavation become the depreciable basis of
          a grove and are written off over 25 years.

          Development costs for sugarcane are capitalized the
          same as citrus.  However, sugarcane matures in one
          year and the Company is able to harvest an average
          of 3 crops (1 per year) from one planting.  As a re-
          sult, cultivation/caretaking costs are expensed as
          the crop is harvested, while the appropriate deve-
          lopment and planting costs are depreciated over 3
          years.

          The breeding herd consists of purchased animals and
          animals raised on the ranch.  Purchased animals are
          stated at cost.  The cost of animals raised on the
          ranch is based on the accumulated cost of developing
          such animals for productive use.

          Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is
          computed on straight-line and accelerated methods
          over the estimated useful lives of the various
          classes of depreciable assets.

          The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accor-
          dance with the provisions of SFAS No. 121, "Accoun-
          ting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets for
          Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of". This Statement
          requires the long-lived assets and certain identifi-
          able intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever
          events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
          carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
          Recoverability of assets to be held and used is
          measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of

<PAGE>
          an asset to future net cash flows expected to be
          generated by the asset.  If such are considered to
          be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
          measured by the amount by which the carrying amount
          of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
          Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower
          of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to
          sell.


         (g) Land Inventories

          Land inventories are carried at cost and consists of
          property located in Lee County, Florida and owned by
          Agri-Insurance Co., Ltd.  The property is held for
          sale as commercial real estate.

         (h) Other Investments

          Other investments are carried at cost which primarily
          includes stock owned in cooperatives.  The Company
          uses cooperatives to process and sell sugarcane and
          cattle. Cooperatives typically require members to ac-
          quire ownership as a term of use of its services.

         (i) Income Taxes
          ____________

          The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset
          and liability method.  Under this method, deferred
          tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
          future tax consequences attributable to differences
          between the financial statement carrying amounts of
          existing assets and liabilities and their respective
          tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
          measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
          to taxable income in the years in which those tem-
          porary differences are expected to be recovered or
          settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and
          liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
          in income in the period that includes the enactment
          date.

         (j) Net Earnings Per Share

          Outstanding stock options issued by the Company
          represent the only dilutive effect reflected in the

<PAGE>
          computation of diluted weighted average shares
          outstanding assuming dilution.  Options do not
          impact the numerator of the earnings per
          share computation.

          There were no stock options that could potentially
          dilute basic earnings per share in the future that
          were not included in the computation of earnings per
          share assuming dilution.

         (k)  Cash Flows
          __________

          For purposes of the cash flows, cash and cash invest-
          ments include cash on hand and amounts due from
          financial institutions with an original maturity of
          less than three months.

         (l)  Use of Estimates
          ________________

          In preparing the consolidated financial statements,
          management is required to make estimates and assump-
          tions that effect the reported amounts of assets and
          liabilities.  Actual results could differ signifi-
          cantly from those estimates.  Although some
          variability is inherent in these estimates, manage-
          ment believes that the amounts provided are adequate.

         (m)  Financial Instruments and Accruals
          __________________________________

          The carrying amounts in the consolidated balance
          sheets for accounts receivable, mortgage and notes
          receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses
          approximate fair value, because of the immediate or
          short term maturity of these items.  The carrying
          amounts reported for the Company's long-term debts
          approximate fair value.

          (n) Derivative and Hedging Instruments
          __________________________________
          In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards
          Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for
          Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities",
          which establishes accounting and reporting standards
          for derivative instruments, including certain deriva-
          tive instruments embedded in other contracts (collec-

<PAGE>
          tively referred to as derivatives), and for hedging
          activities.  SFAS No. 133 was amended by SFAS No. 138
          in June 2000, in part, to allow "normal purchases and
          normal sales" transactions to be excluded from SFAS
          133.  At September 1, 2000, the Company had no open
          derivatives.  Accordingly, the Company's adoption of
          the provisions of SFAS No. 133, as amended, on
          September 1, 2000, did not result in a transition
          adjustment.

          The Company engages in cattle futures trading acti-
          vities for the purpose of economically hedging
          against price fluctuations. The Company records gains
          and losses related to economic hedges in costs of
          goods sold.  At August 31, 2002 and 2001, the
          Company had no open positions.

         (o) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
         ______________________________________

         Comprehensive income is defined as the change in
         equity of a business enterprise during a period from
         transactions and other events and circumstances from
         non-owner sources.  It includes both net income and
         other comprehensive income.  Items included in other
         comprehensive income are classified based on their
         nature. The total of other comprehensive income for a
         period has been transferred to an equity account and
         displayed as "accumulated other comprehensive income".

         (p) Stock-Based Compensation
         ________________________

         The Company applies Accounting Principles Board
         Opinion No. 25,"Accounting for Stock Issued to
         Employees" (APB 25) for stock options and other stock-
         based awards while disclosing pro forma net income
         and net income per share as if the fair value method
         had been applied in accordance with Statement of
         Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,"Accounting
         for Stock-based Compensation"  (SFAS 123).

        (q) Reportable Segments
        _________________

        The Company has three reportable segments: citrus,
        sugarcane, and ranch.  The citrus segment produces
        fruit for both the fresh fruit and processed juice mar-

<PAGE>
        kets.  The sugarcane segment produces sugarcane for
        processing.  The ranch segment raises beef cattle to
        be sold in the wholesale market.

        The Company's reportable segments are strategic busi-
        ness units that offer different products.  They are
        managed separately because each business requires
        different operating strategies.

       (r) Reclassifications
        _________________

        Certain amounts from 2001 have been reclassified to
        conform to the 2002 presentation.

   (2)  Marketable Securities Available for Sale
        ________________________________________

        The Company has classified 100% of its investments in
        marketable securities as available for sale and, as
        such, the securities are carried at estimated fair
        value.  Any unrealized gains and losses, net of
        related deferred taxes, are recorded as a net amount
        in a separate component of stockholders' equity until
        realized.

(7)  Commitments and Contingencies
     _____________________________

     The Company is involved in various claims and legal
     actions arising in the ordinary course of business.  In
     the opinion of management,the ultimate disposition of
     these matters will not have a material adverse effect on
     the Company's consolidated financial position, results of
     operation or liquidity.





<PAGE>
(8)  Other non-current liability
     ___________________________

     Alico formed a wholly owned insurance subsidiary, Agri
     Insurance Company, Ltd. (Bermuda) ("Agri") in June of
     2000.  Agri was formed in response to the lack of insur-
     ance availability, both in the traditional commercial in-
     surance markets and governmental sponsored insurance pro-
     grams, suitable to provide coverages for the increasing
     number and potential severity of agricultural related
     events.  Such events include citrus canker, crop diseases,
     livestock related maladies and weather.  Alico's goal in-
     cluded not only prefunding its potential exposures related
     to the aforementioned events, but also to attempt to at-
     tract new underwriting capital if it is successful in
     profitably underwriting its own potential risks as well as
     similar risks of its historic business partners.  Alico
     primarily utilized its inventory of land and additional
     contributed capital to bolster the underwriting capacity
     of Agri.  As Agri has converted certain of the assets
     contributed by Alico to cash, book and tax differences
     have arisen resulting from differing viewpoints related
     to the tax treatment of insurance companies for
     federal and state tax purposes.  Due to the historic
     nature of the primary assets contributed as capital to
     Agri and the timing of the sales of certain of those as-
     sets by Agri,management has decided to record a contin-
     gent liability, providing for potential differences in the
     tax treatment of sales of Agri's assets in its initial
     year of operation.  Management's decision has been
     influenced by perceived changes in the regulatory
     environment.

(9)  Stock Option Plan
     __________

     On November 3, 1998, the Company adopted the Alico, Inc.,
     Incentive Equity Plan ("The Plan") pursuant to which the
     Board of Directors of the Company may grant options, stock
     appreciation rights, and/or restricted stock to certain
     directors and employees.  The Plan authorizes grants of
     shares or options to purchase up to 650,000 shares of
     authorized but unissued common stock.  Stock options have
     vesting schedules which are at the discretion of the
     Board of Directors and determined on the effective date
     of the grant.

     All stock options granted, except as noted in the para-
     graph below, have been granted to directors or employees
     with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the com-
     mon stock at the date of the grant. The Company applies
     APB Opinion No. 25 for issuances to directors and
     employees in accounting for its Plan. No compensation cost
     was recognized in the consolidated financial statements
     through August 31, 2000, as options were issued at or
     above fair value.

     On September 9, 1999, the Company granted 14,992 stock
     options with an exercise price of $14.62 and a fair value
     of $15.813. The Company recorded $18 thousand of unearned
     compensation at the date of the grant.  On September 12,
     2000, the Company granted an additional 51,074 stock
     options with an exercise price of $14.62 and a fair value
     of $16.313.  The Company recorded $86 thousand of unearned
     compensation at the date of the grant.

     On September 11, 2001, the Company granted an additional
     69,598 stock options with an exercise price of $15.68 and
     a fair value of $28.48.  The Company recorded $891
     thousand of unearned compensation at the date of the
     grant.

     Had the Company determined compensation cost based on the
     fair value at the grant date for its stock options under
     SFAS No. 123, the Company's net income would have changed
     to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

     Some items of revenue and expense included in the state-
     ment of operations may not be currently taxable or de-
     ductible on the income tax returns. Therefore, income tax
     assets and liabilities are divided into a current portion,
     which is the amount attributable to the current year's
     tax return,and a deferred portion, which is the amount
     attributable to another year's tax return.  The revenue
     and expense items not currently taxable or deductible are
     called temporary differences.

     The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise
     to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and
     deferred tax liabilities are presented below (in thousands):

     Agri Insurance Company, Ltd. (Agri), a wholly owned
     insurance company subsidiary of Alico, is treated as a
     U.S. taxpayer,pursuant to an election under Internal
     Revenue Code Section 953(d), for all purposes except for
     consolidating an operating loss by virtue of the dual con-
     solidated loss rules.  (Dual consolidated losses prevent
     operating losses (not capital losses) from occurring in
     insurance companies domiciled outside of the United States
     from offsetting operating income irrespective of the fact
     that the insurance company is a member of the consolidated
     return group.)

     Agri was established to provide agricultural insurance
     that falls outside of the Federal Crop Insurance Program,
     for catastrophic perils.  Agri was domiciled in Bermuda
     because it offers easy access to reinsurance markets.

     Agri issued its initial policy in August 2000 to a third
     party.  Agri's ability to underwrite insurance risks has
     been limited to its operational liquidity, by the Regis-
     trar of Companies in Bermuda.  Agri will be able to under-
     write additional insurance as its liquidity is increased
     from additional asset sales and as payments are received
     on prior sales.  For Federal income tax purposes, only
     premiums received by Agri from policies of insurance is-
     sued to parties other than its parent, Alico Inc., are
     considered insurance premiums.  The preceding limiting
     factors resulted in Agri not incurring a tax liability on
     underwriting profits or investment income.  Agri's tax
     status resulted in it filing its Federal tax return on a
     stand alone basis for the calendar year periods ending
     December 31, 2001 and 2000.

     Citrus
     ______

     Citrus revenues of $19.1 million, $19.9 million and $20.0
     million were recognized for a portion of citrus crops sold
     under a marketing agreement with Ben Hill Griffin, Inc.
    (Griffin) for the years ended August 31, 2002, 2001 and
     2000, respectively.  Griffin and its subsidiaries is the
     owner of approximately 49.85 percent of the Company's com-
     mon stock.  Accounts receivable, resulting from citrus
     sales, include amounts due from Griffin totaling $6.5 mil-
     lion and $6.9 million at August 31, 2002 and 2001, res-

<PAGE>
     pectively.  These amounts represent estimated revenues to
     be received periodically under pooling agreements as the
     sale of pooled products is completed.

     Harvesting, marketing, and processing costs, related to
     the citrus sales noted above, totaled $7.1 million, $7.6
     million, and $7.5 million for the years ended August 31,
     2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  In addition, Griffin
     provided the harvesting services for citrus sold to
     unrelated processors. The aggregate cost of these services
     was $2.0 million, $2.2 million and $2.0 million for the
     years ended August 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
     The accompanying consolidated balance sheets include ac-
     counts payable to Griffin for citrus production, harvest-
     ing and processing costs in the amount of $594 thousand
     and $414 thousand at August 31, 2002 and 2001,
     respectively.

     Other Transactions
     __________________

     The Company purchased fertilizer and other miscellaneous
     supplies, services, and operating equipment from Griffin,
     on a competitive bid basis, for use in its cattle, sugar-
     cane, sod and citrus operations.  Such purchases totaled
     $6.2 million, $6.0 million and $5.5 million during the
     years ended August 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

(13) Future Application of Accounting Standards
     __________________________________________

     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standard Board
    (FASB) issued Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
     141, "Business Combinations".  This statement addresses
     financial accounting and reporting for business combina-
     tions and supersedes Accounting Principal Board (APB)
     Option No. 16, "Business Combinations", and FASB Statement
     No. 38, "Accounting for Preacquisition Contingencies of
     Purchased Enterprises".  All business combinations in the
     scope of this Statement are to be accounted for using one
     method, the purchase method.  The provisions of this
     Statement apply to all business combinations initiated af-
     ter June 30, 2001.  The Statement also applies to all
     business combinations accounted for using the purchase
     method which the date of acquisition is July 1, 2001, or
     later.  Adoption of this Statement is not expected to have
     a significant impact on the financial position or results
     of operations of the Company.

<PAGE>
     In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and
     Other Intangible Assets".  This Statement addresses finan-
     cial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and
     other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17,
     "Intangible Assets".  It addresses how intangible assets
     that are acquired individually or with a group of other
     assets (but not those acquired in a business combination)
     should be accounted for in financial statements upon their
     acquisition.  This Statement also addresses how goodwill
     and other intangible assets should be accounted for after
     they have been initially recognized in the financial
     statements.  Adoption of this Statement is not expected
     to have a significant impact on the financial position or
     results of operations of the Company.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for
     Asset Retirement Obligations."  This statement addresses
     financial accounting and reporting for obligations asso-
     ciated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets
     and the associated asset retirement costs.  It applies to
     legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-
     lived assets that result from the acquisition, construc-
     tion, development and (or) the normal operation of a long-
     lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees.
     This Statement is effective for financial statements with
     fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002.  Adoption of
     this Statement is not expected to have a significant im-
     pact on the financial position or results of operations of
     the Company.

     In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting
     for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."
     This Statement addresses financial accounting and report-
     ing for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
     This Statement supercedes both FASB Statement No. 121,
    "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to Be
     Disposed Of" and the accounting and reporting provisions
     of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting
     the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Dis-
     posal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Un-
     usual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions
     of a Segment of a Business." This Statement is effective
     for financial statements with fiscal years beginning af-
     ter December 15, 2001. Adoption of this Statement is not
     expected to have a significant impact on the financial
     position or results of operations of the Company.

______________________________________________________________
     The Company incurred losses during the years ended August
     31, 2001 and 2000, related to citrus canker eradication.
     The eradication program called for the removal of 507
     acres of citrus trees from a grove in Hendry County, Flo-
     rida.  While the trees were insured under the Federal Crop
     Insurance Program, additional relief funding was available
     and secured by the Company from both Federal and State
     government sources.  A summary of the recovery sources,
     related basis of the trees removed and the crop inventory
     losses are summarized (in thousands) as follows:

or other employees who have a significant role in the regist-
rant's internal controls;
and

6. The registrant's other certifying officers and I have
