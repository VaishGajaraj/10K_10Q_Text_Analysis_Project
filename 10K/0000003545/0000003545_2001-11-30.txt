                                 PART I
                                 ______

Item 1.          Business.
__________________________

Alico, Inc. (the "Company") is generally recognized as an agribusiness
company operating in Central and Southwest Florida.  The Company's primary
asset is 142,551 acres of land located in Collier, Hendry, Lee and Polk
Counties.  (See table on Page 7 for location and acreage by current primary
use.)  The Company is involved in various operations and activities
including citrus fruit production, cattle ranching, sugarcane and sod
production, and forestry.  The Company also leases land for farming, cattle
grazing, recreation, and oil exploration.

The Company's land is managed for multiple use wherever possible.  Cattle
ranching, forestry and land leased for farming, grazing, recreation and oil
exploration, in some instances, utilize the same acreage.

Agricultural operations have combined to produce from 68 to 91 percent of
annual revenues during the past five years.  Citrus groves generate the
most gross revenue.  Sugarcane ranks second in revenue production.  While
the cattle ranching operation utilizes the largest acreage, it ranks third
in the production of revenue.  Approximately 9,197 acres of the Company's
property are classified as timberlands, however, the area in which these
lands are located is not highly rated for timber production.  These lands
are also utilized as native range, in the ranching operation, and leased
out for recreation and oil exploration.

Diversification of the Company's agricultural base was initiated with the
development of a Sugarcane Division at the end of the 1988 fiscal year.
The 11,722 acres in production during the 2001 fiscal year consisted of
903 acres planted in 1995, 2,649 acres planted in 1996, 2,430 acres planted
in 1997, 3,377 acres planted in 1998, 2,363 acres planted in 1999.

Leasing of lands for rock mining and oil and mineral exploration, rental of
land for grazing, farming, recreation and other uses, while not classified
as agricultural operations, are important components of the Company's land
utilization and operation.  Gross revenue from these activities during the
past five years has ranged from 2 to 3 percent of total revenue.

The Company is not in the land sales and development business, except
through its wholly owned subsidiary, Saddlebag Lake Resorts, Inc.; however,
it does from time to time sell properties which, in the judgment of
management, are surplus to the Company's primary operations.  Gross revenue
from land sales during the past five years has ranged from 1 to 24 percent
of total revenues.

For further discussion of the relative importance of the various segments
of the Company's operations, including financial information regarding
revenues, operating profits (losses) and assets attributable to each major
segment of the Company's business, see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" included elsewhere in this document.

<PAGE>

Subsidiary Operations
_____________________

The Company has two wholly owned subsidiaries; Saddlebag Lake Resorts,
Inc. ("Saddlebag") and Agri-Insurance Company, Ltd. ("Agri").

Saddlebag has been active in the subdividing, development and sale of
real estate since its inception in 1971. Saddlebag has two
subdivisions near Frostproof, Florida which have been developed
and are on the market.  Approximately 61% of the lots have been sold.

Agri, formed during fiscal 2000, was created to write crop insurance
against catastrophic losses due to weather and disease. The subsidiary
wrote minor policies during 2000.  During fiscal 2001, Agri supplied
reinsurance to an independent underwriter who insured
catastrophic business interruption coverage for Ben Hill Griffin, Inc.
The total coverage under the policy was $3,143,537 and the premium charged
was $126,860.  The coverage term was from December 19, 2000 to December 19,
2001. There was a claim incurred during the year totaling $212,000.  The
Company expects to renew the policy and appropriately adjust premium
rates.  The financial results of the operation of these subsidiaries
are consolidated with those of the Company.  (See Note 1 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Citrus
______

Approximately 10,371 acres of citrus were harvested during the 2000 season.
Since 1983 the Company has maintained a marketing contract covering the
majority of the Company's citrus crop with Ben Hill Griffin, Inc., a
Florida corporation and major shareholder.  The agreement provides for
modifications to meet changing market conditions and provides that either
party may terminate the contract by giving notice prior to August 1st,
preceding the fruit season immediately following.  Under the terms of the
contract the Company's fruit is packed and/or processed and sold along with
fruit from other growers, including Ben Hill Griffin, Inc.  The proceeds
are distributed on a pro rata basis as the finished product is sold.
During the year ended August 31, 2001, approximately 77% of the Company's
fruit crop was marketed under this agreement, as compared to 76% in 1999/00.
In addition, Ben Hill Griffin, Inc. provides harvesting services to the
Company for citrus sold to unrelated processors.  These sales accounted for
the remaining 23% of total citrus revenue for the year.  In fiscal year
1999, approximately 89% of the Company's fruit crop was marketed under this
agreement.



Ranch
______

The Company has a cattle operation located in Hendry and Collier counties,
Florida which is engaged primarily in the production of beef cattle and the
raising of replacement heifers.  The breeding herd consists of
approximately 14,000 cows, bulls and replacement heifers.  Approximately
44% of the herd are from one to five years old, while the remaining 56% are
six and older.  The Company primarily sells to packing and processing
plants.  The Company also sells cattle through local livestock auction
markets and to contract cattle buyers.  These buyers provide ready markets
for the Company's cattle.  The loss of any one or a few of these plants
<PAGE>
and/or buyers would not, in management's view, have a material adverse
effect on the Company's cattle operation.  Subject to prevailing market
conditions, the Company may hedge its beef inventory by entering into cattle
futures contracts to reduce exposure to changes in market prices.

Sugarcane
_________

The Company had 11,722 acres, 9,588 acres, and 5,432 acres of sugarcane
in production during the 2000/01,1999/00, and 1998/99 fiscal years,
respectively.  The 2000/01, 1999/00, and 1998/99 crops yielded
approximately 417,000, 321,000, and 216,000 gross tons, respectively.

Forest Products
_______________

Approximately 6% of the Company's properties are classified as timberlands.
The principal forest products sold by the Company are pulpwood and sabal
palms.  These products are sold to a paper company and various landscaping
companies, respectively.  The Company does not incur any of the harvesting
expenses.

Part of the lands, from which the timber was removed, is being converted to
semi-improved pasture and other uses.

Land Rental for Grazing, Agricultural and Other Uses
____________________________________________________

The Company rents land to others for grazing, farming and recreational
uses, on a tenant-at-will basis, for an annual fee.  The income is not
significant when compared to overall gross income, however, it does help to
offset the expense of carrying these properties until they are put to a
more profitable use.  The Company has developed additional land to lease
for farming.

There were no significant changes in the method of rental for these
purposes during the past fiscal year.

Leases for Oil and Mineral Exploration
______________________________________

The Company has leased subsurface rights to a portion of its properties
for the purpose of oil and mineral exploration.  Currently, there are two
leases in effect.

Twenty-four wells have been drilled during the years that the Company has
been leasing subsurface rights to oil companies.  The drilling has resulted
in twenty-one dry holes, one marginal producer, which has been abandoned,
and two average producers, still producing.

Mining Operations: Rock and Sand
_________________________________

The Company leases 7,927 acres in Lee County, Florida to CSR America,
Inc. of West Palm Beach, Florida for mining and production of rock,
aggregate, sand, baserock and other road building and construction
materials.

<PAGE>
Royalties which the company receives for these products are based on a
percentage of the F.O.B. plant sales price.

Competition
___________

As indicated, the Company is primarily engaged in a limited number of
agricultural activities, all of which are highly competitive.  For
instance, citrus is grown in several states, the most notable of which are:
Florida, California, Arizona and Texas.  In addition, citrus and sugarcane
products are imported from some foreign countries.  Beef cattle are
produced throughout the United States and domestic beef sales must also
compete with sales of imported beef.  Additionally, forest and rock
products are produced in most parts of the United States.  Leasing of land
for oil exploration is also widespread.

The Company's share of the market for citrus, sugarcane, cattle and forest
products in the United States is insignificant.

Environmental Regulations
_________________________

The Company's operation is subject to various federal, state and local laws
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment.  The Company is
in substantial compliance with all such rules and such compliance has not
had a material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or the
competitive position of the Company.

While compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material
economic effect on the Company's operations, executive officers are
required to spend a considerable amount of time keeping current on these
matters.  In addition, there are ongoing costs incurred in complying with
the permitting and reporting requirements.

Employees
_________

At the end of August 2001, the Company had a total of 150 full-time
employees classified as follows:  Citrus 71; Ranch 22; Sugarcane 15;
Facilities Maintenance Support 28; General and Administrative 14.  There
are no employees engaged in the development of new products or research.
Management is not aware of any efforts by employees or outside organizers
to create any type of labor union arrangement.  Management believes that
the employer/employee relationship environment is such that labor
organization activities are unlikely to occur.

Seasonal Nature of Business
___________________________

As with any agribusiness enterprise, the Company's business operations are
predominantly seasonal in nature.  The harvest and sale of citrus fruit
generally occurs from October to June.  Sugarcane is harvested during the
first, second and third quarters.  Other segments of the Company's business
such as its cattle and sod sales, and its timber, mining and leasing
operations, tend to be more successive than seasonal in nature.

<PAGE>





Item 2.          Properties.
____________________________

At August 31, 2001, the Company owned a total of 142,551 acres of land
located in four counties in Florida.  Acreage in each county and the
primary classification with respect to present use of these properties is
shown in the following table:

         ______  _______   ______  ___  _____  _____ ______  _____  _______
         ______  _______   ______  ___  _____  _____ ______  _____  _______
</TABLE>

Of the above lands, the Company utilizes 24,178 acres of improved pasture
plus approximately 50,000 acres of native pasture for cattle production and
7,927 acres are leased for rock mining operations.  Much of the land is
also leased for multi-purpose use such as cattle grazing, oil exploration,
agriculture and recreation.

In addition to the land shown in the above table, the Company owns full
subsurface rights to 1,064 acres and fractional subsurface rights to
18,707 acres.

From the inception of the Company's initial development program in 1948,
the goal has been to develop the lands for the most profitable use.  Prior
to implementation of the development program, detailed studies were made of
the properties focusing on soil capabilities, topography, transportation,
availability of markets and the climatic characteristics of each of the
tracts.  Based on these and later studies, the use of each tract was
determined.  It is the opinion of Management that the lands are suitable
for agricultural, residential and commercial uses.  However, since the
Company is primarily engaged in agricultural activities, some of the lands
are considered surplus to its needs for this purpose and, as indicated
under Item 1 of this report, sales of real property are made from time to
time.

Management believes that each of the major programs is adequately supported
by agricultural equipment, buildings, fences, irrigation systems and other
amenities required for the operation of the projects.
<PAGE>
Item 3.          Legal Proceedings.
___________________________________

The Company has been informed by Ben Hill Griffin III that he is
party to a lawsuit filed against him in Polk County, Florida Circuit
Court by the families of his four sisters, most of the members of whom
are beneficiaries of a trust, entitled the Ben Hill Griffin, Jr.
Revocable Intervisos Trust #1 (the "Trust"). The plaintiffs in the
lawsuit (The Four Sisters Protectorate, et al. v. Ben Hill Griffin,
III, Trustee, Case No. GC-G-0054, Section 81) sought to impose
judicial sanctions on Mr. Griffin III, including his removal as
Trustee of the Trust based on allegations of over-compensation
and receipt of an illegal bonus. On March 29, 2001, after
court-ordered mediation pending completion of which the trial was
adjourned, Mr. Griffin III and a representative of the Four Sisters
Protectorate, joined by their respective counsel, executed a
"Settlement Agreement" which set forth the basic elements of
a settlement of the lawsuit, contingent upon several events,
including Internal Revenue Service approval of the proposed
transaction as a tax free split-off for federal income tax
purposes, and the Court's judicial termination of the Trust.
The terms contained in the Settlement Agreement were not intended,
nor were they sufficient, to resolve all specific items necessary
to consummate a settlement of the lawsuit. The Settlement Agreement
provided that the shares of Alico stock then owned by Ben Hill Griffin
Investments would be utilized in the tax free split-off, along with
other assets, as a means of allocating to the Four Sisters Protectorate
assets approximating the value of their interests in Ben Hill Griffin
Investments, a holding company wholly owned by the Trust, Ben Hill
Griffin III, and the families represented in the Four Sisters Protectorate.

Mr. Griffin III has indicated that almost immediately following execution
of the Settlement Agreement the parties disagreed as to its validity
or enforceability on various grounds. On May 14, 2001, the Harris Family
filed a motion in the Circuit Court of the 10th Judicial Circuit in
and for Polka County, Florida (Case No. GC-G-0054) seeking to have the
Settlement Agreement set aside as invalid and unenforceable. On
November 2, 2001 the Court entered a written order that the
Settlement Agreement is enforceable. Mr. Griffin III's attorneys indicate
that a large number of issues related to the mechanism and terms of the
proposed distribution of certain of the assets of the Trust to the
families of the four sisters, including the Alico stock beneficially
owned by the Trust, remain to be worked out between the representatives
of the four sisters and Ben Hill Griffin III and are currently being
negotiated. According to them these terms are expected to be set
forth in a definitive separation agreement, which is still being negotiated
by the parties to the litigation but is expected to be finalized shortly.
The Company further understands that consummation of the settlement will
be subject to various conditions which are still being discussed,
but will include the requirement that the parties receive a favorable
IRS Revenue Ruling. Mr. Griffin III's attorneys indicate that no ruling
request has yet been submitted. Neither the Company nor Mr. Griffin III
know when or if the settlement will be implemented but believe the IRS
ruling process alone could take 6 months from the date a ruling request
is submitted.

Mr. Griffin III has also informed the Company that immediately before
the hearing on the enforcement of the State court action, lawyers
for the Harris family provided Mr. Griffin III's attorneys with copies
of a federal court action naming among others as defendants, Mr. Griffin III,
individually and as Trustee of the Ben Hill Griffin Jr. Revocable Intervisos
Trust #1, and BHG Inc.  According to Mr. Griffin III's attorneys, this
Litigation was filed in the federal district court for the Northern District
of Florida (Case No: 4:olcv 432-5PM).  The complaint, among other things,
seeks to set aside the settlement agreement based on alleged violations
of the securities laws, fraud, and negligence.  Although this suit was filed
on October 2, 2001, Mr. Griffin III's attorneys indicate that, as of this
date, neither Mr. Griffin III nor BHG Inc. has been served in this action.
Mr. Griffin III's attorneys have indicated that they believe this suit is
without merit, if not frivolous, and have stated that if Mr. Griffin III
is ever served, he will defend it vigorously.

Since the Company opted out of the Florida Business Corporation Act's provisions
on Affiliated Transactions and Control Share Acquisitions (currently FBCA
s. 607.0901 and s. 607.0902) under the predecessor statutes to such sections,
transactions contemplated by the Settlement Agreement may not be subject
to shareholder approval or review by the Company's Board of Directors.

The Company is not a party to any of this litigation.

Dividends are paid at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors.
The Company foresees no change in its ability to pay annual dividends in
the immediate future; nevertheless, there is no assurance that dividends
will be paid in the future since they are dependent upon earnings, the
financial condition of the Company, and other factors.

Item 7.          Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
__________________________________________________________________

                 Condition and Results of Operations.
                 ____________________________________

The following discussion focuses on the results of operations and the
financial condition of Alico.

This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and notes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
_______________________________

The Company had cash and marketable securities of $25.0 million at August
31, 2001 compared with $19.9 million at August 31, 2000.  Working capital
increased from $44.2 million at August 31, 2000 to $53.7 million at
August 31, 2001.

Cash outlay for land, equipment, building, and other improvements totaled
$8.9 million during fiscal 2001, compared to $10.0 million during August
31, 2000 and $27.9 million in 1999, respectively. Land preparation for
sugarcane development and capital maintenance continued, as did
expenditures for replacement equipment and raising of breeding cattle.
Capital projects for the upcoming year are expected to include development
of additional sod acreage.

Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its working
capital requirements for the foreseeable future with internally generated
funds.  In addition, the Company has credit commitments which provide
for revolving credit of up to $44 million of which $12.2 million was
available for the Company's general use at August 31, 2001 (see Note 6 of
Notes to consolidated financial statements).

Operating Revenue
_________________

Operating revenues for fiscal 2001 increased compared to fiscal 2000.
An increase in revenues from agricultural activities was the most
significant factor in the rise.

Operating revenues for fiscal 2000 increased when compared to those of
fiscal 1999.  An increase in revenues from agricultural activities was
the most significant factor in the rise.

Gross Profit
____________

Gross profit from operations increased 35% during fiscal 2001. Increased
sugarcane production and cattle sales are, combined with improved market
prices, the primary factors in the rise.

Gross profit from operations increased 80% during fiscal 2000.  Improved
market prices for both citrus and beef combined with increased citrus
production as the primary factors in the rise.

Profit on Sale of Real Estate
____________________________________

Profit from the sale of real estate decreased from $13.3 million in fiscal
2000 to $11.4 million in fiscal 2001.  The Company recognized a $9.5 million
gain on the sale of 488 acres, sold during fiscal 2000, upon receipt of the
first annual mortgage payment which, combined with the initial payment in
fiscal 2000, exceeded 20% of the contract price.

Real estate profits increased from $3.8 million to $13.3 million during
fiscal 2000.  The most significant factor in the increase was the sale
of 1,270 acres in Lee County, Florida for $16.5 million.  The sale
generated a $13.4 million pre-tax gain.

<PAGE>
Interest and Investment Income
______________________________

Interest and investment income is generated principally from investments in
marketable equity securities, corporate and municipal bonds, mutual funds,
U.S. Treasury securities and mortgages held on real estate sold on the
installment basis.  Realized investment earnings were reinvested throughout
fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, increasing investment levels during each year.
The decrease in fiscal 2001 interest and realized and unrealized investment
income resulted from unfavorable market conditions.  The rise in fiscal 2000
and 1999 interest and realized and unrealized investment income for the years
presented resulted from reinvested investment income and favorable market
conditions during each of the years.

Interest Expense
________________

Interest expense increased during fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, compared to
each respective prior year. This was primarily due to increased borrowings
related to the acquisition of 7,680 acres of sugarcane, citrus and ranch
during fiscal 1999. Total interest cost increased slightly in 2001 and
increased 54% and 53% during 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Individual Operating Divisions
______________________________

Gross profit for the individual operating divisions, for fiscal 2001, 2000
and 1999, is presented in the following schedule and is discussed in
subsequent sections:

Citrus
______

Gross profit was $ 5.1 million in fiscal 2001, $6.7 million in fiscal 2000,
and $2.4 million for fiscal 1999.

Revenue from citrus sales decreased 2% during fiscal 2001, compared to
fiscal 2000 ($27.6 million during fiscal 2001 vs. $28.2 million during
fiscal 2000).

Production increased during fiscal 2001, however, the average market
price decreased, compared to fiscal 2000.
<PAGE>
Harvesting and marketing costs increased over the prior year due to the
increase in boxes harvested during the year.  Direct production and
allocated costs increased 8% due to inflation and increased cultivation
costs related to replanting trees.

Revenue from citrus sales increased 20% during fiscal 2000, compared
to fiscal 1999 ($28.2 million during fiscal 2000 vs. $23.5 million during
fiscal 1999).

Production and the average market price improved during fiscal 2000,
compared to fiscal 1999.

Harvesting and marketing costs increased over the prior year, corresponding
with an increase in yields.  Direct production and allocated costs decreased
13% resulting from more favorable growing conditions, requiring less
caretaking expenses.

The final returns from citrus pools are not precisely determinable at year
end.  Returns are estimated each year based on the most current information
available.  Differences between the estimates and the final realization
of revenues can be significant.  Revenues collected in excess of prior
year and year end estimates were $617 thousand, $1.8 million, and
$160 thousand during fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Sugarcane
_________

Gross profit for fiscal 2001 was $2.6 million compared to $1.5 million in
fiscal 2000, and $2.6 million in fiscal 1999.

Sales revenues from sugarcane increased 40% during fiscal 2001, compared to
fiscal 2000 ($11.9 million vs. $8.5 million, respectively).  Direct
production costs increased 37% during fiscal 2001, compared to fiscal 2000,
respectively.)  The rise in revenue and related costs was the result of the
increase in the number of producing acres and improved market prices for
sugar.

Sales revenues from sugarcane increased 20% during fiscal 2000, compared to
fiscal 1999 ($8.5 million vs. $7.1 million, respectively).  The rise in
revenue and related costs was the result of the increase in the number
of producing acres.  However, a decline in the market price for sugar
and sugar yield per acre offset the increased production, creating a 42%
decrease in division earnings.

Ranching
________

The gross profit (loss) from ranch operations for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999
was $1.6 million, $739 thousand, and ($8) thousand, respectively.

Revenues from cattle sales increased 54% during fiscal 2001, compared to
fiscal 2000 ($9.3 million in fiscal 2001 vs. $6.1 million in fiscal 2000).
The number of animals sold during fiscal 2001 increased 52% over the prior
year due to increased in the number of feeder cattle sold during the current
year.  The rise in revenue was also affected by improved market prices for
beef.

Direct and allocated costs increased 45% when compared to the prior year
($7.5 million during fiscal 2001 and $5.1 million during fiscal 2000)
corresponding to the decrease in the number of animals sold.

Revenues from cattle sales decreased 3% during fiscal 2000, compared to
fiscal 1999 ($6.1 million in fiscal 2000 vs. $6.3 million in fiscal 1999).
The number of animals sold during the year decreased 13% under the prior
year due to decreased sales of feeder cattle during the year.  However, a
significant improvement in market prices for beef is the primary cause
of the increase in earnings for the division.

Direct and allocated costs decreased 16% when compared to the prior year
($5.3 million during fiscal 2000 and $6.3 million during fiscal 1999)
corresponding to the decrease in the number of animals sold.

The Company's cattle marketing activities include retention of calves in
western feedlots, contract and auction sales, and risk management contracts.

Other Operations
________________

Revenues from oil royalties and land rentals were $770 thousand as compared
to $923 thousand for fiscal 2000 and $711 thousand for fiscal 1999.

<PAGE>

Returns from rock products and sand were $1.7 million for fiscal 2001,
$1.3 million for 2000 and $1.3 million during 1999.  Rock and sand
supplies are sufficient to meet current demand, and no major price changes
have occurred over the past 3 years.

Profits from the sale of sabal palms, for landscaping purposes, during
fiscal 2001 were $91 thousand compared to $84 thousand and $136 thousand
for fiscal years 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Direct and allocated expenses charged to the "Other" operations category
included general and administrative and other costs not charged directly to
the citrus, ranching, sugarcane divisions.  These expenses totaled $5.5
million during fiscal 2001 compared to $4.4 million during fiscal 2000 and
to $3.5 million during fiscal 1999.

General Corporate
_________________

The Company is continuing its marketing and permitting activities for its
land which surrounds the Florida Gulf Coast University site.  There are
sales contracts in place for more than 7,400 acres of the Lee County,
Florida property totaling $167 million.  The agreements are at various
stages of the due diligence periods with closing dates over the next ten
years.

The Company announced the formation of Agri-Insurance Company, Ltd. (Agri)
a wholly owned subsidiary, during July of 2000.  The insurance company was
initially capitalized by transferring cash and approximately 3,000 acres of
the Lee County property (along with sales contracts totaling $8 million).
Through Agri, the Company expects to be able to underwrite previously
uninsurable risk related to catastrophic crop and other losses.
Additionally, the insurance company will have access to reinsurance
markets, otherwise inaccessible.  To expedite the creation of the capital
liquidity necessary to underwrite the Company's exposure to catastrophic
losses, another 5,600 acres was transferred during fiscal 2001.  Agri
underwrote a limited amount of coverage during fiscal 2001, and is expected
to begin writing more significant coverages before the end of December 2001.

During September of 1999, the Company announced a sale of 1,270 acres
of land surrounding the University site in Lee County for $16.5 million.
The contract called for 25 percent of the purchase price to be paid at
closing, with the balance payable over the next four years.  In August
of 2000, Agri sold another 488 acres to the same buyer, also near the
University, for $10.6 million.  In connection with the sale, the purchaser
agreed to pay off the $12.3 million mortgage related to the September 1999
sale and pay 10% of the contract price for their second purchase at closing,
with the balance payable over the next four years.  The first sale generated
a pre-tax gain of $13.4 million.  The gain related to the second sale was
recognized during fiscal 2000, to the extent that 10% of the purchase price
has been collected net of closing costs ($959 thousand).  The remainder of
the gain and related mortgage were recognized during the current fiscal
year upon receipt of the first annual mortgage payment which, combined
with the initial payment in fiscal 2000, exceeded 20% of the contract price.

Item 7(a).      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk
_________________________________________________________________________

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to our investment portfolio.  We do not have derivative financial
instruments in our investment portfolio. We place our investments with high
quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any
one issuer.  We are adverse to principal loss and ensure the safety and
preservation of our invested funds by limiting default, market and
reinvestment risk.  We classify our cash equivalents and short-term
investments as fixed-rate if the rate of return on such instruments remains
fixed over their term.  These fixed-rate investments include fixed-rate U.S.
government securities, municipal bonds, time deposits and certificates of
deposit.  We classify our cash equivalents and short-term investments as
variable-rate if the rate of return on such investments varies based on the
change in a predetermined index or set of indices during their term.  These
variable-rate investments primarily include money market accounts, mutual
funds and equities held at various securities brokers and investment banks.
The table below presents the amounts (in thousands) and related weighted
interest rates of our investment portfolio at August 31, 2001:

                           Independent Auditors' Report
                          ____________________________

The Stockholders and Board of Directors
Alico, Inc.:

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Alico, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of August 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2001.  In connection with
our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited
the related consolidated financial statement schedules as listed in Item
14(a)(2) herein.  These consolidated financial statements and financial
statements schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alico,
Inc. and subsidiaries at August 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended August 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion,
the related consolidated financial statement schedules, when considered
in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

   			 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                  Years Ended August 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999

(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
     __________________________________________

     (a)  Basis of Consolidated Financial Statement Presentation
          ______________________________________________________

          The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
          Alico, Inc. (the Company) and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
          Saddlebag Lake Resorts, Inc. (Saddlebag), and Agri-Insurance
          Company, Ltd. (Agri), after elimination of all significant
          intercompany balances and transactions.

     (b)  Revenue Recognition
          ___________________

          Income from sales of citrus under marketing pool agreements is
          recognized at the time the crop is harvested.  The revenue is
          based on the Company's estimates of the amounts to be received as
          the sales of pooled products are completed.  Fluctuation in the
          market prices for citrus fruit has caused the Company to recognize
          additional revenue from the prior year's crop totaling $617,086,
          $1,839,642, and $159,748 during fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
          respectively.

     (c)  Real Estate
          ___________

          Real estate sales are recorded under the accrual method of
          accounting.  Retail land sales are not recognized until payments
          received, including interest, aggregate 10 percent of the
          contract sales price for residential real estate or 20 percent
          for commercial real estate.  At August 31, 2000, the Company
          had deferred revenue of $9,540,000 related to commercial real
          estate which was sold subject to a mortgage note receivable
          (note 3).  Sales are discounted to yield the market rate of
          interest where the stated rate is less than the market rate.
          The recorded valuation discounts are realized as the balances
          due are collected.  In the event of early liquidation, interest
          is recognized on the simple interest method.

          Tangible assets that are purchased during the period to aid in
          the sale of the project as well as costs for services performed
          to obtain regulatory approval of the sales are capitalized as
          land and land improvements to the extent they are estimated to be
          recoverable from the sale of the property.  Land and land
          improvement costs are allocated to individual parcels on a per
          lot basis using the relative sales value method.

          The Company has entered into an agreement with a real estate
          consultant to assist in obtaining the necessary regulatory
          approvals for the development and marketing of a tract of raw
<PAGE>
          land.  The marketing costs under this agreement are being
          expensed as incurred.  The costs incurred to obtain the necessary
          regulatory approvals are capitalized into land costs when paid.
          These costs will be expensed as cost of sales when the underlying
          real estate is sold.

     (d)  Marketable Securities Available for Sale
          ________________________________________

          Marketable securities available for sale are carried at the
          estimate fair value of the portfolio.  Net unrealized investment
          gains and losses are recorded net of related deferred taxes in a
          separate component of stockholders' equity until realized.

          Fair value for debt and equity investments is based on quoted
          market prices at the reporting date for those or similar
          investments.  The cost of all marketable securities available for
          sale are determined on the specific identification method.

     (e)  Inventories
          ___________

          Beef cattle inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
          market.  The cost of the beef cattle inventory is based on the
          accumulated cost of developing such animals for sale.

          Unharvested crops are stated at the lower of cost or market.  The
          cost for unharvested crops is based on accumulated production
          costs incurred during the eight month period from January 1
          through August 31.

     (f)  Property, Buildings and Equipment
          _________________________________

          Property, buildings and equipment are stated at cost.  Properties
          acquired from the Company's predecessor corporation in exchange
          for common stock issued in 1960, at the inception of the Company,
          are stated on the basis of cost to the predecessor corporation.
          Property acquired as part of a land exchange trust is valued at
          the carrying value of the property transferred to the trust.

          The breeding herd consists of purchased animals and animals
          raised on the ranch.  Purchased animals are stated at cost.  The
          cost of animals raised on the ranch is based on the accumulated
          cost of developing such animals for productive use.

          Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is computed on
          straight-line and accelerated methods over the estimated useful
          lives of the various classes of depreciable assets.

      (g) Income Taxes
          ____________

          The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
          liability method.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and
          liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
          attributable to differences between the financial statement
          carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
<PAGE>
          respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
          measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
          income in the years in which those temporary differences are
          expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax
          assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
          income in the period that includes the enactment date.

         (h)  Basic Earnings Per Share
          ________________________

          Earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income by
          the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
          the year.  The Company has no dilutive securities.

     (i)  Cash Flows
          __________

          For purposes of the cash flows, cash and cash investments include
          cash on hand and amounts due from financial institutions with an
          original maturity of less than three months.

     (j)  Use of Estimates
          ________________

          In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is
          required to make estimates and assumptions that effect the
          reported amounts of assets and liabilities.  Actual results could
          differ significantly from those estimates.  Although some
          variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes
          that the amounts provided are adequate.

     (k)  Financial Instruments and Accruals
          __________________________________

          The carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheets for
          accounts receivable, mortgage and notes receivable, accounts
          payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value, because
          of the immediate or short term maturity of these items.
          The carrying amounts reported for the Company's long-term
          debts approximate fair value.

      (l) Derivative and Hedging Instruments
          __________________________________

          In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
          issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
          Hedging Activities", which establishes accounting and reporting
          standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
          instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred
          to as derivatives), and for hedging activities.  SFAS No. 133 was
          amended by SFAS No. 138 in June 2000, in part, to allow "normal
          purchases and normal sales" transactions to be excluded from
          SFAS 133.  At September 1, 2000, the Company had no open
          derivatives.  Accordingly, the Company's adoption of the provisions
          of SFAS No. 133, as amended, on September 1, 2000, did not result in
          a transition adjustment.


<PAGE>
          The Company engages in cattle futures trading activities for the
          purpose of economically hedging against price fluctuations. The
          Company records gains and losses related to economic hedges in
          costs of goods sold.  At August 31, 2001, the Company had no
          open positions.

     (m) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
         ______________________________________

         Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of
         a business enterprise during a period from transactions and
         other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.
         It includes both net income and other comprehensive income.
         Items included in other comprehensive income are classified
         based on their nature. The total of other comprehensive income
         for a period has been transferred to an equity account and
         displayed as "accumulated other comprehensive income".

     (n) Stock-Based Compensation
         ________________________

         The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
         "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25) for stock
         options and other stock-based awards while disclosing pro forma
         net income and net income per share as if the fair value method
         had been applied in accordance with Statement of Financial
         Accounting Standards No. 123,"Accounting for Stock-based
         Compensation"  (SFAS 123).

     (o) Operating Segment
        _________________

        Alico, Inc. has four reportable segments: citrus, sugarcane,
        ranch and general corporate.  The commodities produced by these
        segments are sold to wholesalers and processors who prepare the
        products for consumption.  The Company's operations are all located
        in Florida.

    (p) Reclassifications
        _________________

        Certain amounts from 2000 have been reclassified to conform to the
        2001 presentation.

   (2)  Marketable Securities Available for Sale
        ________________________________________

        The Company has classified 100% of its investments in marketable
        securities as available for sale and, as such, the securities are
        carried at estimated fair value.  Any unrealized gains and losses,
        net of related deferred taxes, are recorded as a net amount in a
        separate component of stockholders' equity until realized.

        The cost and estimated fair values of marketable securities available
        for sale at August 31, 2001 and 2000 (in thousands) were as follows:

     All stock options granted, except as noted in the paragraph below,
     have been granted to directors or employees with an exercise price
     equal to the fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant.
     The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 for issuances to directors
     and employees in accounting for its Plan. No compensation cost has
     been recognized in the consolidated financial statements through
     August 31, 1999, as options were issued at or above fair value.

<PAGE>
     On September 9, 1999, the Company granted 14,992 stock options with
     an exercise price of $14.62 and a fair value of $15.813.  The
     Company recorded $17,885 of unearned compensation at the date of
     the grant.  On September 12, 2000, the Company granted an additional
     51,074 stock options with an exercise price of $14.62 and a fair
     value of $16.313.  The Company recorded $86,468 of unearned compen-
     sation at the date of the grant.

     Had the Company determined compensation cost based on the fair value
     at the grant date for its stock options under SFAS No. 123, the

     retirement plan covering the officers and other key management personnel
     of the Company.  The plan is being funded by the purchase of insurance
     contracts.  The accrued pension liability for the nonqualified defined
     benefit retirement plan at August 31, 2001 and 2000 was $147,108 and
     $249,488, respectively.

     Some items of revenue and expense included in the statement of operations
     may not be currently taxable or deductible on the income tax returns.
     Therefore, income tax assets and liabilities are divided into a current
     portion, which is the amount attributable to the current year's tax return,
     and a deferred portion, which is the amount attributable to another year's
     tax return.  The revenue and expense items not currently taxable or
     deductible are called temporary differences.

     The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
     portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are

     Agri Insurance Company, Ltd. (Agri), a wholly owned insurance
     company subsidiary of Alico, is treated as a U.S. taxpayer,
     pursuant to an election under Internal Revenue Code Section 953
     (d), for all purposes except for consolidating an operating loss
     by virtue of the dual consolidated loss rules.  (Dual consolidated
     losses prevent operating losses (not capital losses) from
     occurring in insurance companies domiciled outside of the United
     States from offsetting operating income irrespective of the fact
     that the insurance company is a member of the consolidated return
     group.)

     Agri was established to provide agricultural insurance that falls
     outside of the Federal Crop Insurance Program, for catastrophic
     perils.  Agri was domiciled in Bermuda because it offers easy
     access to reinsurance markets.

     Agri issued its initial policy in August 2000 to a third party.
     Agri's ability to underwrite insurance risks has been limited
     to its operational liquidity, by the Registrar of Companies in
     Bermuda.  Agri will be able to underwrite additional insurance
     as its liquidity is increased from additional asset sales and as
     payments are received on prior sales.  For Federal income tax
     purposes, only premiums received by Agri from policies of
     insurance issued to parties other than its parent, Alico, are
     considered insurance premiums.  The preceding limiting factors
     resulted in Agri not incurring a tax liability on underwriting
     profits or investment income.  Agri's tax status resulted in
     it filing its Federal tax return on a stand alone basis on a
     calendar year period ending December 31, 2000.   It should be
     noted that during the fiscal year ending August 31, 2001, Agri
     incurred an underwriting loss of approximately $212,000.

     Citrus
     ______

     Citrus revenues of $19,908,087, $20,032,730 and $18,188,136 were
     recognized for a portion of citrus crops sold under a marketing
     agreement with Ben Hill Griffin, Inc. (Griffin) for the years
     ended August 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Griffin and
     its subsidiaries is the owner of approximately 50.78 percent of
     the Company's common stock.  Accounts receivable, resulting from
     citrus sales, include amounts due from Griffin totaling
     $6,901,275 and $7,717,325 at August 31, 2001 and 2000,
     respectively.  These amounts represent estimated revenues to
     be received periodically under pooling agreements as the sale of
     pooled products is completed.

     Harvesting, marketing, and processing costs, related to the citrus sales
     noted above, totaled $7,614,788, $7,531,491, and $6,127,603 for the years
     ended August 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  In addition, Griffin
     provided the harvesting services for citrus sold to unrelated processors.
     The aggregate cost of these services was $2,185,899, $1,987,660 and
     $791,932 for the years ended August 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
     respectively.  The accompanying consolidated balance sheets include
     accounts payable to Griffin for citrus production, harvesting and
     processing costs in the amount of $414,126 and $616,430 at August 31,
     2001 and 2000, respectively.

     for use in its cattle, sugarcane, sod and citrus operations.  Such
     purchases totaled $6,029,491, $5,518,087 and $6,019,927 during the years
     ended August 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     June 30, 2001.  The Statement also applies to all business combinations
     accounted for using the purchase method which the date of acquisition
     is July 1, 2001, or later.  Adoption of this Statement is not expected
     to have a significant impact on the financial position or results of
     operations of the Company.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
     Intangible Assets".  This Statement addresses financial accounting
     and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and
     supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets".  It addresses how
     intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of
     other assets (but not those acquired in a business combination)
     should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition.
     This Statement also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets
     should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in
     the financial statements.  Adoption of this Statement is not expected
     to have a significant impact on the financial position or results of
     operations of the Company.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset
     Retirement Obligations."  This statement addresses financial
     accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the
     retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated
     asset retirement costs.  It applies to legal obligations associated
     with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the
     acquisition, construction, development and (or) the normal operation
     of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees.
     This Statement is effective for financial statements with fiscal
     years beginning after June 15, 2002.  Adoption of this Statement
     is not expected to have a significant impact on the financial
     position or results of operations of the Company.

     In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the
     Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."  This Statement
     addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment
     or disposal of long-lived assets.  This Statement supercedes
     both FASB Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
     Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and the accounting and reporting
     Provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting
     the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
     Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently
     Occurring Events and Transactions of a Segment of a Business."
     This Statement is effective for financial statements with fiscal
     years beginning after December 15, 2001. Adoption of this Statement
     is not expected to have a significant impact on the financial position
     or results of operations of the Company.

 13) Recovery of Citrus Canker Eradication Costs in Excess of Basis
     ______________________________________________________________

     The Company incurred losses during the years ended August 31, 2001
     and 2000, related to citrus canker eradication.  The eradication
     program called for the removal of 507 acres of citrus trees from
     a grove in Hendry County, Florida.  While the trees were insured
     under the Federal Crop Insurance Program, additional relief funding
     was available and secured by the Company from both Federal and State
     government sources.  A summary of the recovery sources, related
     basis of the trees removed and the crop inventory losses are
     summarized (in thousands) as follows:
