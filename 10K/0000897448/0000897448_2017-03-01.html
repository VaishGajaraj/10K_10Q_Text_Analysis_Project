<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT>150 mg/dL), approximately 40&nbsp;million adults in the United States have high triglyceride levels (TG <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT>200 mg/dL), and approximately 4.0&nbsp;million people
in the United States have severely high triglyceride levels (TG <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT>500 mg/dL), commonly known as very high triglyceride levels. Many patients with high triglyceride levels also have diabetes and other lipid
level abnormalities such as high cholesterol. The patient condition of having more than one lipid level abnormality is referred to as mixed dyslipidemia. According to <I>The American Heart Association Scientific Statement on Triglycerides and
Cardiovascular Disease </I>(2011), triglycerides provide important information as a marker associated with the risk for heart disease and stroke, especially when an individual also has low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or <FONT

very high triglyceride levels suggest that reducing triglyceride levels is the primary goal in patients to reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis. The effect of Vascepa on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, or the risk for pancreatitis, in

determined that there were insufficient data to conclude that drug-induced changes in serum triglycerides could be recognized by the FDA as a valid surrogate for reducing cardiovascular risk in the ANCHOR population for the purpose of regulatory
approval of a drug targeted at a triglyceride-lowering indication in this population. The FDA has acknowledged that the standard of proof required by the FDA for approval of a new drug indication is higher than that generally used to inform patient
treatment guidelines and that used by physicians in clinical practice. The FDA did not determine that the drug-induced effects of Vascepa, which go beyond triglyceride-lowering, would not actually reduce cardiovascular risk in this population and

DMC completed its review of the interim analysis in September 2016 and, consistent with previously stated expectations, recommended that the trial continue as planned without modification. The
second planned interim analysis of efficacy results will be triggered by the onset of approximately 80% of the target aggregate number of primary cardiovascular events in the study. Based on historical event rates, we anticipate that the onset of
approximately 80% of events will occur in the first half of 2017, with the second <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-specified</FONT> interim efficacy analysis by the DMC expected in or about the third quarter of 2017. The interim efficacy
analysis will be accompanied by an interim safety analysis by the DMC. As is typical, the statistical threshold for defining overwhelming efficacy on the primary endpoint at interim analyses is considerably higher than the threshold for defining
statistical significance at the end of the study. In addition, we have requested the DMC to not recommend stopping the study early based only upon the achievement of statistical significance for the primary endpoint, but to ensure that supportive
trends of benefit are also consistently observed in certain secondary endpoints and subpopulations before recommending that the study be stopped early for overwhelming efficacy. This is the same approach we asked the DMC to employ in connection with
the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> study 60% interim analysis. It is our expectation that the 80% interim analysis will also result in a recommendation by the DMC to continue the trial. By design, it is most common for
cardiovascular outcomes studies not to be stopped upon an interim look. We remain blinded to all data from the study. Unless overwhelming efficacy and safety is declared by the DMC at an interim look or the study is halted due to a patient safety
concern, Amarin personnel will remain blinded to the efficacy and safety data from the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> study until the study is complete. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

scientific rationale for the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> study is also supported by research on the putative cardioprotective effects of EPA as presented in scientific literature. It is possible that the effects of EPA may be
due not to a single mode of action, such as triglyceride lowering, but rather to multiple mechanisms working together. Studies in the scientific literature explore potentially beneficial effects of EPA on multiple atherosclerosis processes,
including endothelial function, oxidative stress, foam cell formation, inflammation/cytokines, plaque formation/progression, platelet aggregation, thrombus formation, and plaque rupture. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> study is

of Vascepa to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease so long as the promotion is truthful and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-misleading.</FONT> This use of Vascepa at issue reflects recognized medical practice but was not approved by the
FDA and is thus not covered by current <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> labeling for the drug. Promotion of an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> use is considered by the FDA to be illegal under the FDCA. The
lawsuit, captioned <I>Amarin Pharma, Inc., et al. v. Food</I><I></I><I>&nbsp;&amp; Drug Administration, et al.</I>, 119 F. Supp. 3d 196 (S.D.N.Y. 2015), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In the
lawsuit, we contended principally that FDA regulations limiting <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> promotion of truthful and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-misleading</FONT> information are unconstitutional under the freedom of
speech clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as applied in the case of our proposed promotion of Vascepa. The physicians in the suit regularly treat patients at risk of cardiovascular disease and, as the complaint contended, have
First Amendment rights to receive truthful and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-misleading</FONT> information from Amarin. The suit was based on the principle that better informed physicians make better treatment decisions for their patients.
The FDA opposed this lawsuit but did not dispute the veracity of the subject ANCHOR clinical trial data, the safety data from which is already in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> labeling of Vascepa, or the peer-reviewed research
related to Vascepa and the potential for cardiovascular risk reduction. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In connection with this litigation, the FDA sent a

The FDA stated in this letter that it did not have concerns with much of the information we proposed to communicate and provided us with guidance on the FDA&#146;s view of lawful, but limited paths for the dissemination and communication to
healthcare professionals of the effects of Vascepa demonstrated in the ANCHOR clinical trial and use of peer-reviewed scientific publications in the context of appropriate disclaimers. </FONT></P>

triglycerides, and that such speech may not form the basis of a misbranding action under the FDCA. In August 2015, we began to communicate promotional information beyond the MARINE indication to healthcare professionals in the United States as
permitted by this court declaration. The FDA did not appeal the court&#146;s ruling. In March 2016, we settled this litigation under terms by which the FDA and the U.S. government agreed to be bound by the conclusions from the federal court order

submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country&#146;s national health authority and an independent ethics
committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#146;s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Similarly, clinical trials conducted in countries such as Australia, Canada, and
New Zealand, require review and approval of clinical trial proposals by an ethics committee, which provides a combined ethical and scientific review process. Most countries in which clinical studies are conducted require the approval of the clinical

</I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws
restrict certain marketing practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for a referral or the purchasing,
leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any healthcare facility, item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to
arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Liability may be established without a person or entity having actual knowledge of the federal anti-kickback statute or
specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil
False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to
induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants or patient
assistance programs. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or
causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making or using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly
concealing, or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a &#147;whistleblower&#148; to bring actions on behalf
of the federal government alleging violations of the statute and to share in any monetary recovery. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated or faced enforcement actions under the federal civil False
Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper marketing activities, including providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing consulting fees, grants, free travel, and
other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe the company&#146;s products; or causing false claims to be submitted because of the company&#146;s marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Pharmaceutical and
other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs. </FONT></P>

falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. In addition, HITECH imposes certain

Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to engage in extensive tracking of payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, including physician ownership and
investment interests, and public reporting of such data. Pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program are required to have
started tracking such payments on August 1, 2013, and must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to
items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer&#146;s
products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines, and imprisonment. There are also state laws requiring pharmaceutical companies to report gifts and other expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical
products; prohibiting certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain healthcare providers; and/or requiring pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the exceptions or safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a company marketing an FDA-approved product in the United States, our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and
state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal anti-kickback statute. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy
regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">If our operations are found to be
in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations,
any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In the United States
and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the
United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for
Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug
benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs,
and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D
drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of
prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise
obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the
MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers. In addition, there has been renewed interest in amending the Social Security Act to allow Medicare to negotiate prices for prescription drugs covered under Medicare Part
B. If this were to be enacted by Congress and </FONT></P>

proceedings consistent with the decision. On July&nbsp;22, 2015, Watson Laboratories Inc., the purported first Vascepa ANDA filer, sought to intervene and appeal the court&#146;s decision. We and
FDA opposed this intervention effort. The applicable courts denied Watson the relief sought and appeal periods have expired. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Based on the May&nbsp;28, 2015 District of Columbia court order granting our motion for summary judgment in the NCE litigation, on
June&nbsp;26, 2015, the parties to the related Vascepa patent litigation that followed acceptance by FDA of ANDAs to Vascepa, based on a three-year regulatory exclusivity determination, agreed to a full stay of proceeding in that patent litigation.
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Following the May&nbsp;28, 2015 District of Columbia court order setting aside FDA&#146;s denial of NCE exclusivity for
Vascepa, FDA notified the ANDA filers that FDA had changed the status of their ANDAs to submitted, but no longer accepted, and notified ANDA filers that FDA had ceased review of the pending ANDAs. In rescinding acceptance of the ANDAs, the statutory
basis for the patent litigation (accepted ANDAs) no longer existed. Thus, on July&nbsp;24, 2015, we moved to dismiss the pending patent infringement lawsuits against each of the Vascepa ANDA applicants in the U.S. District Court for the District of
New Jersey. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On January&nbsp;22, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey granted our motion to dismiss
all patent infringement litigation related to the 2014 acceptance by the FDA of ANDAs to Vascepa. An appeal of the court&#146;s dismissal was filed by one ANDA filer and, after FDA&#146;s May 2016 grant of Vascepa NCE exclusivity, that appeal was
withdrawn by the ANDA filer. This dismissal and terminated appeal ended this patent litigation related to Vascepa. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On
May&nbsp;31, 2016, in a reversal that FDA and we view as consistent with the court&#146;s May&nbsp;28, 2015 summary judgment motion, FDA determined that Vascepa is eligible for five-year, NCE marketing exclusivity. This determination provides
Vascepa with the benefits of NCE exclusivity afforded by statute. NCE exclusivity for Vascepa runs from its date of&nbsp;FDA&nbsp;approval on&nbsp;July 26, 2012&nbsp;and extends until&nbsp;July 26, 2017. The statutory
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-month</FONT> stay triggered by patent litigation following generic application submissions permitted on&nbsp;July 26, 2016&nbsp;would continue until January&nbsp;26, 2020, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">seven-and-a-half</FONT></FONT></FONT> years from&nbsp;FDA&nbsp;approval, unless such patent litigation was resolved against us sooner. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">It is possible that FDA&#146;s NCE determination could be challenged by interested parties. If challenged, we plan to vigorously support
FDA&#146;s determination. Any such challenge could have a negative impact on our company and create uncertainty around the continued benefits associated with a five-year exclusivity status. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In September and October 2016, we received paragraph IV certification notices from four companies contending to varying degrees that
certain of our patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, sale or offer for sale of a generic form of Vascepa as described in those companies&#146; ANDAs. These certifications were expected given the
eligibility for submission of ANDAs under the NCE regulatory structure, after the expiration of four years from the July 2012 approval of Vascepa. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are now in the process of defending the exclusivity of Vascepa through patent litigation against the ANDA filers. In the related lawsuits, we are seeking, among other remedies, an order enjoining
filers from marketing generic versions of Vascepa before the last to expire of the asserted patents in 2030. We intend to vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights relating to Vascepa, but we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or
any subsequently filed lawsuits. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">If an ANDA filer is ultimately successful in patent litigation against us, it meets the
requirements for a generic version of Vascepa to the satisfaction of the FDA under its ANDA (after the applicable regulatory exclusivity period and the litigation-related <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-month</FONT> stay period ends), and is
able to supply the product in significant commercial quantities, the generic company could introduce a generic version of Vascepa. Such a market entry would likely limit our U.S. sales substantially, which would have an adverse impact on our
business and results of operations. In addition, even if a competitor&#146;s effort to introduce a generic product is ultimately unsuccessful, the perception that such development is in progress and/or news related to such progress could materially
affect the perceived value of our company and our stock price. </FONT></P>

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In January 2013, we launched Vascepa based on FDA approval of our MARINE indication, for use as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adult patients with severe (TG <FONT

as very high triglyceride levels. Guidelines for the management of very high triglyceride levels suggest that reducing triglyceride levels is the primary goal in patients to reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis. A secondary goal for this patient
population is to reduce cardiovascular risk. The effect of Vascepa on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, or the risk for pancreatitis, in patients with hypertriglyceridemia has not been determined and our

portion of their time to promoting Vascepa with our approximately 150 sales professionals, including sales representatives and their managers, based on a plan designed to focus on select sales territories that we believe have demonstrated the
greatest potential for Vascepa sales growth and increase both the number of sales targets reached and the frequency of sales calls on existing sales targets. However, the commercialization of pharmaceutical products is a complex undertaking, and we
have very limited experience as a company operating in this area and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-promoting</FONT> a pharmaceutical product with a partner. In addition, if the results of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT>
outcomes study are successful, we plan to expand our promotion of Vascepa, including increasing the size of our team. We will need to overcome challenges associated with rapidly hiring and training personnel and managing larger teams of people.
Furthermore, our agreement with Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. is designed such that their <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-promotion</FONT> of Vascepa ceases after 2018. If we do not extend this
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-promotion</FONT> agreement, enter into a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-promotion</FONT> agreement with an equally capable company or hire equally capable sales representatives, our sales may be negatively

<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In April 2015, we received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA on our supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, that
sought approval for the use of Vascepa in patients with high triglyceride levels (TG <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT>200 mg/dL and &lt;500 mg/dL) who are also on statin therapy, which we refer to as the ANCHOR indication. In regulatory
communications, the FDA acknowledged that the results of the ANCHOR trial as we presented them to FDA were valid and truthful in that, for example, Vascepa reduced triglyceride levels compared to placebo in patients treated in the ANCHOR study. The
clinical rationale for reducing serum triglycerides with Vascepa and modifying other lipid/lipoprotein parameters shown in ANCHOR among statin-treated patients with triglycerides <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">200-499</FONT> mg/dL is to reduce
cardiovascular risk. In not approving our ANCHOR sNDA, the FDA concluded that, for regulatory approval purposes, there were insufficient data to support a drug-induced change in serum triglycerides as a surrogate for reducing cardiovascular risk in
the ANCHOR population. The FDA did not determine that the drug-induced effects of Vascepa, which go beyond triglyceride-lowering, would not actually reduce cardiovascular risk in this population. </FONT></P>

inability to obtain, further expansion of our marketing approval rights with an FDA approval could prevent us from growing revenue at all or greater than our current pace and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our operations and

example, if the approval process for any expanded indication takes too long, we may miss market opportunities and give other companies the ability to develop competing products or establish market dominance. If the FDA does not approve any expanded
indication at all, it could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the terms of any approvals beyond the approval received from the FDA in July 2012 for the MARINE indication may prove to

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In May 2015, we and a group of independent physicians filed a lawsuit against the FDA
seeking a federal court declaration that would permit us and our agents to promote to healthcare professionals the use of Vascepa in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and promote on the potential of Vascepa to reduce the risk of cardiovascular
disease so long as the promotion is truthful and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-misleading.</FONT> This use of Vascepa at issue reflects recognized medical practice but was not approved by the FDA and is thus not covered by current <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> labeling for the drug. Promotion of an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> use is considered by the FDA to be illegal under the FDCA. The lawsuit, captioned <I>Amarin Pharma, Inc., et al.
v. Food</I><I></I><I>&nbsp;&amp; Drug Administration, et al.</I>, 119 F. Supp. 3d 196 (S.D.N.Y. 2015), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In the lawsuit, we contended principally that FDA regulations
limiting <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> promotion of truthful and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-misleading</FONT> information are unconstitutional under the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution as applied in the case of our proposed promotion of Vascepa. The physicians in the suit regularly treat patients at risk of cardiovascular disease and, as the complaint contended, have First Amendment rights to receive truthful and <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-misleading</FONT> information from Amarin. The suit was based on the principle that better informed physicians make better treatment decisions for their patients. The FDA opposed this lawsuit but did not dispute the
veracity of the subject ANCHOR clinical trial data, the safety data from which is already in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> labeling of Vascepa, or the peer-reviewed research related to Vascepa and the potential for
cardiovascular risk reduction. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In connection with this litigation, the FDA sent a detailed letter to us on June&nbsp;5, 2015
that confirmed the validity of the ANCHOR trial results. The letter also sought to clarify how, in the FDA&#146;s view, applicable law and FDA policies apply to the communications proposed in our complaint. The FDA stated in this letter that it did
not have concerns with much of the information we proposed to communicate and provided us with guidance on the FDA&#146;s view of lawful, but limited paths for the dissemination and communication to healthcare professionals of the effects of Vascepa
demonstrated in the ANCHOR clinical trial and use of peer-reviewed scientific publications in the context of appropriate disclaimers. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In August 2015, we were granted preliminary relief in this lawsuit through the court&#146;s declaratory judgment that confirmed we may engage in truthful and
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-misleading</FONT> speech promoting the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> use of Vascepa to healthcare professionals, i.e., to treat patients with persistently high triglycerides, and that such
speech may not form the basis of a misbranding action under the FDCA. In August 2015, we began to communicate promotional information beyond the MARINE indication to healthcare professionals in the United States as permitted by this court
declaration. The FDA did not appeal the court&#146;s ruling. In March 2016, we settled this litigation under terms by which the FDA and the U.S. government agreed to be bound by the conclusions from the federal court order that we may engage in
truthful and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-misleading</FONT> speech promoting the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> use of Vascepa and that certain statements and disclosures that we proposed to make to healthcare

under applicable law to more broadly promote Vascepa, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> labeling for Vascepa did not change as a result of this litigation and settlement, and neither government nor other third-party coverage
or reimbursement to pay for the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> use of Vascepa promoted under the court declaration was required. Based on our communications with the FDA, we expect that final positive results from the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> outcomes study will be required for label expansion for Vascepa. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Even though we
have the benefit of a final settlement in this litigation, our promotion is still subject to a high, perhaps abnormally high, degree of scrutiny to ensure that our promotion remains within the scope covered by the settlement. For example, under the
settlement, we remain responsible for ensuring our speech is truthful and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-misleading.</FONT> Federal and state governments may also seek to find other means to prevent our promotion of unapproved truthful and <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-misleading</FONT> information about Vascepa. If our promotional activities or other operations are found to be in violation of any law or governmental regulation through existing or new interpretations, we may be
subject to prolonged litigation, penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of
operations. </FONT></P>

cannot market a generic version of Vascepa before the last to expire of the patents for which Apotex did not make a paragraph IV certification, which is in 2030. At a later date, Apotex may elect to amend its ANDA in order to make a paragraph IV
certification as to additional listed patents. If and when Apotex does make such an amendment, it would be required to send Amarin an additional paragraph IV certification notice, and Amarin would then have the ability to file a lawsuit against

allow the FDA to approve generic versions of brand name drugs like Vascepa differ based on whether a drug receives three-year, or five-year, new chemical entity, or NCE, marketing exclusivity. In May 2016, after significant litigation, FDA
determined that Vascepa is eligible for NCE marketing exclusivity. Accordingly, a related <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-month</FONT> stay is currently in place and is scheduled to continue until January&nbsp;26, 2020, <FONT

three-year marketing exclusivity. Under applicable regulations, such three-year exclusivity would have extended through July&nbsp;25, 2015 and would have been supplemented by a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-month</FONT> stay triggered by

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">NCE marketing exclusivity precludes approval during the five-year exclusivity period of
certain 505(b)(2) applications and ANDAs submitted by another company for another version of the drug. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-infringement.</FONT> In this case, Amarin, as a pioneer drug company, is afforded the benefit of a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-month</FONT> stay against the launch of such a competitive product that
extends from the end of the five-year exclusivity period. A pioneer company could also be afforded extensions to the stay under applicable regulations, including a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">six-month</FONT> pediatric exclusivity extension or
a judicial extension if applicable requirements are met. A drug sponsor could also gain a form of marketing exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments if such company can, under certain circumstances, complete a human clinical trial process and
obtain regulatory approval of its product. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In contrast, a three-year period of exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments
is generally granted for a drug product that contains an active moiety that has been previously approved, such as when the application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted by the sponsor that
were essential to approval of the application. Accordingly, we expect to receive three-year exclusivity in connection with any future regulatory approvals of Vascepa, such as an approval sought based on positive
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> outcomes study results. Such three-year exclusivity protection precludes the FDA from approving a marketing application for an ANDA, a product candidate that the FDA views as having the same
conditions of approval as Vascepa (for example, the same indication and/or other conditions of use), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted to the FDA with Vascepa as the reference product, for a period of three years from the date of FDA approval. The FDA
may accept and commence review of such applications during the three-year exclusivity period. Such three-year exclusivity grant does not prevent a company from challenging the validity of patents at any time, subject to any prior four-year period
pending from a grant of five-year exclusivity. This three-year form of exclusivity may also not prevent the FDA from approving an NDA that relies only on its own data to support the change or innovation. </FONT></P>

situation. On May&nbsp;28, 2015, the court granted our motion for summary judgment. The decision vacated the FDA&#146;s denial of our claim for such exclusivity and remanded to the FDA for proceedings consistent with the decision. On July&nbsp;22,

regulations, for example, claims that such supplements reduce triglyceride levels. Also, for more than a decade now, the FDA has expressly permitted dietary supplement manufacturers that sell supplements containing the

qualifications. These factors enable dietary supplements to effectively compete with Vascepa. In addition, to the extent the net price of Vascepa after insurance and offered discounts is significantly higher than the prices of commercially available
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">omega-3</FONT> fatty acids marketed by other companies as dietary supplements (through that lack of coverage by insurers or otherwise), physicians and pharmacists may recommend these commercial alternatives instead

endpoints, and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the drug product candidate with respect to effectiveness for the indication studied. The ANCHOR trial was, and the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT>
trial is, being conducted under a SPA agreement with the FDA. In each case, the FDA agreed that, based on the information we submitted to the agency, the design and planned analysis of the trial is adequate to support use of the conducted study as
the primary basis for approval with respect to effectiveness. A SPA agreement is not a guarantee of approval. A SPA agreement is generally binding upon the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific
issue essential to determining safety or efficacy after the study begins, or if the study sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. The FDA reserves the right of final determinations for approval based on its review of
the entire data presented in a marketing application. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In October 2013, the FDA notified us that it rescinded the ANCHOR study

STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-specified</FONT> secondary and tertiary endpoints in the study, and added a second interim efficacy and safety analysis by the independent data monitoring committee (DMC) at approximately 80% of the target aggregate
number of primary cardiovascular events. In this amended <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> SPA agreement, FDA agreed that, based on the information submitted to the agency, the critical elements of the revised <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> protocol and analysis plans adequately address the objectives necessary to support a regulatory submission. However, secondary and/or tertiary endpoints, their ordering in the statistical hierarchy, their
clinical significance, or whether any would yield results appropriate for labeling are considered review issues and are not intended to be a binding component of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> SPA agreement. Further, matters
such as endpoint adjudication procedures (including potential endpoint ascertainment, adjudication process, and detailed definitions) were specified by FDA as issues to be reviewed by the agency as part of a drug approval application. Consistent
with the May 2016 FDA SPA draft guidance, FDA stated that the SPA agreement does not necessarily indicate the agency&#146;s agreement with every detail of a protocol; instead, such an agreement indicates FDA&#146;s concurrence with the elements
critical to ensuring that the trial conducted under the protocol would have the potential to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in a marketing application. In September 2016, we announced that the DMC completed its review of the first <FONT

with the SPA agreements for our MARINE and ANCHOR trials, efficacy was evaluated in these trials compared to placebo at twelve weeks. No placebo-controlled studies have been conducted regarding the long-term effect of Vascepa on lipids, and no
outcomes study has been conducted evaluating Vascepa. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> study, which commenced in 2011 and completed patient enrollment and randomization of 8,175 individual patients in 2016, is designed to
evaluate the efficacy of Vascepa in reducing major cardiovascular events in an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">at-risk</FONT> patient population with high triglyceride levels despite being on statin therapy. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Outcomes studies of certain other lipid-modifying therapies have failed to achieve the endpoints of such studies, even though they
reduced triglyceride levels and showed other favorable effects on parameters relevant to cardiovascular health in studied patients. For example, in 2010, the results of the ACCORD-Lipid trial were published. This trial studied the effect of adding
fenofibrate onto open-label simvastatin therapy on cardiovascular outcomes. The addition of fenofibrate did not show any treatment benefit on cardiovascular outcomes over simvastatin monotherapy in this study. In 2011, the results of the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AIM-HIGH</FONT> trial were published. This trial studied the effect of adding a second lipid-altering agent, extended-release niacin, to simvastatin therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in people at high risk for
cardiovascular events. No significant incremental treatment benefit with extended-release niacin was observed. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Outcomes
studies of certain other lipid-modifying therapies included results which, after review of information not fully available to the sponsors during the conduct of the trials, modified initial reports of the trial results. Two examples are the <FONT

which, upon further and more detailed subsequent review, were concluded to not be associated with the study therapy. After the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">IMPROVE-IT</FONT> trial was completed, initial reports on the effect of adding ezetimibe
to statin therapy in subjects with acute coronary syndrome suggested greater benefit on cardiovascular outcomes than was considered to be the case after later reassessment and further evaluation of study data. In 2015, the results of the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">IMPROVE-IT</FONT> trial were published. Based on the published results, the addition of ezetimibe showed incremental lowering of LDL cholesterol levels and improved cardiovascular outcomes. This result was statistically
significant but less than ten percent. Further evaluation of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">IMPROVE-IT</FONT> results suggested that the outcomes benefit may have been lower after factoring in and making certain assumptions regarding
complicating factors such as a high number of patients who discontinued the study drug, withdrew consent, or were lost to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">follow-up.</FONT> FDA approval of a new indication for ezetimibe based on the <FONT

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition, in September 2012, researchers published in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association, </I>or<I> JAMA, </I>the results of a retrospective meta-analysis of twenty previously conducted
studies regarding the use of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">omega-3</FONT> supplements across various patient populations. This meta-analysis suggested that the use of such supplements was not associated with a lower risk of <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">all-cause</FONT> death, cardiac death, sudden death, heart attack, or stroke. These facts illustrate categories of challenges faced in demonstrating favorable results in complex clinical studies like <FONT

from clinical trials are invariably complex. It is also not typically possible to reliably extrapolate results from one trial to predict results from another. For instance, the outcomes studies for fenofibrates and niacin were conducted in patient
populations in which the majority of patients studied had triglycerides below 200 mg/dL and fenofibrates and niacin are believed to work differently than Vascepa in the body and do not have as favorable a side-effect profile, and nineteen of the

failed to show a benefit in reducing the rate of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes when administered to patients with cardiovascular risk factors under
different study conditions than in the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> study. Vascepa is comprised of highly-pure <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ethyl-EPA,</FONT> and has been approved by the FDA for use in adult patients with
severe hypertriglyceridemia at a dose of 4 grams per day and is being studied in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> at 4&nbsp;grams per day. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The only other outcomes study involving the use of a highly-pure formulation of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ethyl-EPA,</FONT> called the Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study (JELIS), suggested that use
of a highly-pure formulation of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ethyl-EPA</FONT> in Japan, when used in conjunction with statins, reduced cardiovascular events by 19% compared to the use of statins alone. However, there are several limitations to
the JELIS study. First, the patient population was exclusively Japanese, the majority of the participants were women, and at baseline patients had a much higher LDL, limiting its generalizability to the intended target population. Also, a low dose
of statins was used. It is unknown whether the positive treatment effects would have persisted if these patients had been optimally treated with statins using contemporary LDL targets in the United States. In addition, JELIS was an open-label trial,
which could influence patient and physician behavior and reporting of symptoms, decisions regarding hospitalization, and referral of events for adjudication. This may be particularly relevant since hospitalization for unstable angina was a primary
contributor of the overall positive result, and is considered a softer endpoint than fatal cardiovascular events. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Further,
FDA determined that JELIS results could not be used as support for or against the use of triglyceride levels as a surrogate for cardiovascular risk reduction. Patients treated with EPA and statin in JELIS achieved triglyceride levels that were only
5% lower, on average, than those achieved among patients treated with statin alone; however, the reduction in cardiovascular risk in the primary endpoint analysis was 19%. Likewise, within the primary and secondary prevention <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">sub-analyses,</FONT> triglyceride levels were lowered only 5% on average in the EPA plus statin group compared with the statin alone group; however, the relative risk reduction was 53% in the primary prevention population
with elevated triglyceride (<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT>150 mg/dL) and low <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">HDL-C</FONT> (<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#163;</FONT>40 mg/dL) levels and 23% in the secondary prevention population
with established coronary artery disease. These large differences in magnitude between triglyceride reduction and risk reduction in JELIS suggest that the effects of EPA on triglyceride levels alone may not be responsible for, or predict, the
observed differences in cardiovascular events between treatment groups in JELIS. JELIS was not designed to evaluate primary and secondary prevention populations. It is possible that the putative cardioprotective effects of EPA observed in JELIS are
due not to a single mode of action, such as triglyceride lowering, but rather to multiple mechanisms working together, such as purported beneficial effects on multiple atherosclerosis processes, including endothelial function, oxidative stress, foam
cell formation, inflammation/cytokines, plaque formation/progression, platelet aggregation, thrombus formation, and plaque rupture. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> study is needed to determine the clinical benefit, if any, of
EPA therapy in statin-treated patients with elevated triglyceride levels. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">There can be no assurance that the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> study will be completed successfully, that the endpoints of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> cardiovascular outcomes study will be achieved, that the results will support regulatory
approvals, or that the lipid-modifying effects of Vascepa in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> or any other study of Vascepa will not be subject to variation beyond twelve weeks. If the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> trial is not successful or if the results of this long-term study are not consistent with the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">12-week</FONT> clinical results, it could prevent us from expanding the
labeled approval of Vascepa or even call into question the currently understood efficacy and safety profile of Vascepa. In any such case, the market potential for Vascepa would suffer and our business would be materially affected. </FONT></P>

results uncertain. Our business could be harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><FONT

may be made about prescription products. In particular, in general, the U.S. government&#146;s position has been that a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product&#146;s approved labeling. Even
though we received FDA marketing approval for Vascepa for the MARINE indication and we believe the First Amendment court ruling and litigation settlement affords us a degree of protection for other promotional efforts, physicians may still prescribe
Vascepa to their patients for use in the treatment of conditions that are not included as part of the indication statement in our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> Vascepa label or our settlement. If we are found to have promoted
Vascepa outside the terms of the litigation settlement or in violation of what federal or state government may determine to be acceptable, we may become subject to significant government fines and other related liability, such as under the FDCA, the
False Claims Act, or other theories of liability. Government may also seek to hold us responsible for the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-compliance</FONT> of our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-promotion</FONT> partner, Kowa
Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., or our commercialization partner outside the United States, Eddingpharm. For example, the Federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined
several companies from engaging in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or
curtailed. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition, incentives exist under applicable laws that encourage competitors, employees and physicians to report

portion of moneys allegedly overbilled to government agencies due to, for example, promotion of pharmaceutical products beyond labeled claims. These incentives could also lead to suits that we have mischaracterized a competitor&#146;s product in the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In September 2016, we announced that the DMC completed its review of the first <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-specified</FONT>
interim efficacy analysis upon reaching approximately 60% of the target aggregate number of cardiovascular events in accordance with the SPA agreement for our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> cardiovascular outcomes trial and,
consistent with previously stated expectations, recommended that the trial continue as planned without modification. The second planned interim analysis of efficacy results will be triggered by the onset of approximately 80% of the target aggregate
number of primary cardiovascular events in the study. Based on historical event rates, we anticipate that the onset of approximately 80% of events will occur in the first half of 2017, with the second
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-specified</FONT> interim efficacy and safety analysis by the DMC expected in or about the third quarter of 2017. The interim efficacy analysis will be accompanied by an interim safety analysis by the DMC. It may
actually take longer than anticipated for the DMC assessment of data for the interim analysis. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Further, as is typical of
interim analyses, the statistical threshold for defining overwhelming efficacy on the primary endpoint that would call for stopping the study early in connection with such analysis is considerably higher than the threshold for defining statistical
significance after the expected completion of the study near the end of 2017. We do not expect the study to be stopped due to overwhelming efficacy at the next interim look. We have requested the DMC to not recommend stopping the study early based
only upon the achievement of statistical significance for the primary endpoint, but to ensure that supportive trends of benefit are also consistently observed in certain secondary endpoints and subpopulations before recommending that the study be
stopped early for overwhelming efficacy. For example, even if the appropriate studied cardiovascular events in the trial occur at sufficiently low rates in the active, Vascepa, group as compared to the placebo group such that the study would be a
success at completion, the more rigorous statistical analysis applied by the DMC at the interim analysis may not warrant stoppage of the study for overwhelming efficacy in connection with the interim analysis. The study may also be stopped pursuant
to recommendation by the DMC at this interim analysis due to low likelihood of obtaining a favorable result at completion. Despite no formal futility analysis or boundary being <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-specified</FONT> in the protocol,
it is within the purview of the DMC to weigh all available information and recommend study stoppage or continuation. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Moreover, it is the DMC that will make the formal recommendation as to whether to stop the study early or to continue as planned. We are
blinded to the interim analysis results and are informed by the DMC of the recommendation to stop the study or to continue as planned. The DMC may consider factors outside the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-specified</FONT> statistical
analysis plan when assessing whether to recommend continuing the study as planned. For example, even if study results are sufficiently positive at the interim analysis to demonstrate overwhelming efficacy, the DMC at its discretion may recommend
continuation of the study as planned with the goal of arriving at more robust results at the planned study completion if it believes that waiting for more robust results outweighs the potential medical benefit of stopping and unblinding the study
early. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The DMC has multiple times per year assessed safety data generated in the ongoing study and has thus far recommended
to continue the study as planned. Thus, multiple safety reviews to date have not warranted study stoppage. Nevertheless, the study may be stopped at any time based on recommendations of the DMC due to safety concerns identified by the DMC during its
ongoing and regularly scheduled safety data assessments. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>We may not be successful in developing or marketing future

we obtain positive results from early stage preclinical studies or clinical trials, we may not achieve the same success in future trials. Clinical trials that we or potential partners conduct may not provide sufficient safety and efficacy data to
obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for product candidates. The failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy for our desired indications could harm the development of that product candidate as well as other product candidates,
and our business and results of operations would suffer. For example, the efficacy results of our Vascepa Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of Huntington&#146;s disease were negative. As a result, we stopped development of that product
candidate, revised our clinical strategy and shifted our focus to develop Vascepa for use in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Questions can also arise on the quality of study data or its reliability. For example, during the public advisory
committee meeting held by FDA as part of its review of our ANCHOR sNDA, a discussion regarding observed, nominally statistically significant changes from baseline in an adverse direction, while on background statin therapy, in certain lipid
parameters, including triglycerides, in the placebo group, raised questions about the possibility that the mineral oil placebo used in the ANCHOR trial (and in the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> trial) might not be biologically
inert and might be viewed as artificially exaggerating the clinical effect of Vascepa when measured against placebo in the ANCHOR trial. Ultimately, no strong evidence for biological activity of mineral oil was identified by the FDA before its
approval of Vascepa after review of the MARINE and ANCHOR trials and consideration of other data regarding mineral oil. It was ultimately concluded that the between-group differences likely provided the most appropriate descriptions of the treatment
effect of Vascepa and that whatever factor(s) led to the within-group changes over time in the placebo group were likely randomly distributed to all treatment groups. Thus, the FDA approved Vascepa for use in the MARINE indication in July 2012, FDA
did not dispute the veracity of the ANCHOR trial data and, in connection with the March 2016 agreement we reached with the FDA allowing us to promote the results of the ANCHOR study, the FDA did not require that we include any qualification related
to this earlier question regarding the mineral oil placebo. The FDA, early on in the course of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> trial, directed the DMC for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> to periodically review

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(ethyl-EPA),</FONT> or Vascepa API, from a single supplier, Nisshin Pharma, Inc., or Nisshin, located in Japan. Nisshin was approved by the FDA as a Vascepa API supplier as part of our FDA NDA for the MARINE

to meet the agreement requirements, may enter into a new development and supply agreement with BASF, and may purchase API from BASF as it remains an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">NDA-approved</FONT> supplier. In 2014, we obtained sNDA approval
for a fourth supplier of API, which includes the manufacturing facility of Finorga SAS (Novasep). We currently purchase and use commercial supply from Novasep, Chemport, and Nisshin. Each of the API manufacturers obtains supply of the key raw

associated with projected expansion and qualification can be significant. For example, Chemport, which was approved as one of our API suppliers in April 2013, is a privately-held company and their commitment to Vascepa supply has required them to
seek additional resources. There can be no assurance that the expansion plans of any of our suppliers will be successful. Our aggregate capacity to produce API is dependent upon the qualification of our API suppliers. Each of our API suppliers has
outlined plans for potential further capacity expansion. If no additional API supplier is approved by the FDA as part of an sNDA, our API supply will be limited to the API we purchase from previously approved suppliers. If our third-party
manufacturing capacity is not expanded and/or compliant with applicable regulatory requirements, we may not be able to supply sufficient quantities of Vascepa to meet anticipated demand. We cannot guarantee that we can contract with any future

similar foreign regulatory bodies and must be conducted in accordance with the FDA&#146;s pharmaceutical current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and comparable requirements of foreign regulatory bodies. There are a limited number of
manufacturers that operate under these cGMPs and International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, regulations who are both capable of manufacturing Vascepa and willing to do
so. Failure by us or our third-party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations, requirements, or guidelines could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to
grant marketing approval of our products, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or voluntary recalls of product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely
affect our business. If we are not able to manufacture Vascepa to required specifications through our current and potential API suppliers, we may be delayed in successfully supplying the product to meet anticipated demand and our anticipated future

accordance with the FDA&#146;s cGMPs. Any new facility may be subject to a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-approval</FONT> inspection by the FDA and would again require us to demonstrate product comparability to the FDA. There are comparable
foreign requirements under ICH guidelines. This review may be costly and time consuming and could delay or prevent the launch of a product. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Furthermore, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require that we be able to consistently produce the API and the finished product in commercial quantities and of specified quality on a repeated basis,
including demonstrated product stability, and document our ability to do so. This requirement is referred to as process validation. This includes stability testing, measurement of impurities and testing of other product specifications by validated
test methods. If the FDA does not consider the result of the process validation or required testing to be satisfactory, the commercial supply of Vascepa may be delayed, or we may not be able to supply sufficient quantities of Vascepa to meet
anticipated demand. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The FDA and similar foreign regulatory bodies may also implement new requirements, or change their
interpretation and enforcement of existing requirements, for manufacture, packaging or testing of products at any time. If we or our approved suppliers are unable to comply, we may be subject to regulatory, civil actions or penalties which could
significantly and adversely affect our business. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>We rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those

reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of
these responsibilities and requirements. Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet

infringement suit against Omthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and its parent company, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP. The suit sought injunctive relief and monetary damages for infringement of our U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;8,663,662. The complaint alleged
infringement of the patent arising from the expected launch of Epanova, a product that is expected to compete with Vascepa in the United States. The patent covers methods of lowering triglycerides by administering a pharmaceutical composition that
includes amounts of EPA as free acid, and no more than about 30% DHA. In November 2014, based on a representation from AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP that the commercial launch of Epanova was not imminent, the court dismissed our complaint, without
prejudice (i.e., preserving our ability to later <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-file</FONT> the suit). The court required the defendant to notify us before any product launch. We intend to pursue this litigation vigorously and aggressively

managed and controlled in the UK, is regarded as resident in the UK for taxation purposes. Under current Irish legislation, a company is regarded as resident for tax purposes in Ireland if it is centrally managed and controlled in Ireland, or, in
certain circumstances, if it is incorporated in Ireland. Where a company is treated as tax resident under the domestic laws of both the UK and Ireland then the provisions of article 4(3) of the Double Tax Convention between the UK and Ireland
provides that such enterprise shall be treated as resident only in the jurisdiction in which its place of effective management is situated. We have sought to conduct our affairs in such a way so as to be resident only in Ireland for tax purposes by
virtue of having our place of effective management situated in Ireland. Trading income of an Irish company is generally taxable at the Irish corporation tax rate of 12.5%. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Non-trading</FONT> income of an Irish
company (e.g., interest income, rental income or other passive income) is taxable at a rate of 25%. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">However, we cannot assure
you that we are or will continue to be resident only in Ireland for tax purposes. It is possible that in the future, whether as a result of a change in law or the practice of any relevant tax authority or as a result of any change in the conduct of
our affairs, we could become, or be regarded as having become resident in a jurisdiction other than Ireland. Our and our subsidiaries&#146; income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. We are currently under audit by the
United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years 2012 to 2013. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, we do not believe the outcome of these audits will have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. The ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Should we cease to be an Irish tax
resident, we may be subject to a charge to Irish capital gains tax on our assets. Similarly, if the tax residency of any of our subsidiaries were to change from their current jurisdiction for any of the reasons listed above, we may be subject to a
charge to local capital gains tax charge on the assets. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>The loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on our

until such time as a suitable replacement is hired. Furthermore, because of the specialized nature of our business, as our business plan progresses we will be highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical

replace any such losses. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities. In this environment, we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business, particularly if

appropriate indices against which the total shareholder return of Amarin should be measured. The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index has been selected because it is an index of U.S. quoted biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. An investment of $100
(with reinvestment of all dividends) is assumed to have been made in our ADSs and in each of the indices on January&nbsp;1, 2012 and its relative performance is tracked through December&nbsp;31, 2016. </FONT></P>

Amarin&#146;s ADSs in 2013 when the FDA notified us that it rescinded the ANCHOR study SPA agreement because the FDA determined that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the effectiveness of Vascepa in the studied population was
identified after testing began in the ANCHOR trial. The FDA expressed that this scientific issue arose based on data from the study of other drugs by other companies related to lipid modification. This FDA notification was followed in 2013 by a
reduction in force by Amarin and retargeting of the commercial targets for promotion of Vascepa. More recently, over the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">3-year</FONT> time period through December&nbsp;31, 2016, cumulative total return for
Amarin&#146;s ADSs exceeded both the NASDAQ Composite Index and NASDAQ Biotechnology Index. In particular, the total return for Amarin&#146;s ADSs well exceeded the cumulative returns for the NASDAQ Composite Index and NASDAQ Biotechnology Index in
each of the past two calendar years. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="font-size:12px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="font-size:0px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="center">

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="1"><SUP STYLE="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">&reg;</SUP></FONT> (icosapent ethyl) capsules, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for use as an adjunct to
diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adult patients with severe (TG <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT>500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia. This <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> indication for Vascepa, known as the MARINE
indication, is based primarily on the successful results from the MARINE study of Vascepa in this approved patient population. In considering this approval, FDA also reviewed the successful results from our study of Vascepa in patients with high
triglyceride levels (TG <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT>200 mg/dL and &lt;500 mg/dL) who are also on statin therapy for elevated <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">low-density</FONT> lipoprotein cholesterol, or <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">LDL-C,</FONT> levels which condition we refer to as mixed dyslipidemia or persistently high triglycerides. This study is known as the ANCHOR study. Safety data from both the MARINE and ANCHOR studies are reflected in <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> labeling for Vascepa. In January 2013, we began selling and marketing Vascepa in the United States based on the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> MARINE indication. In August 2015, we
also began communicating promotional information beyond the MARINE indication to healthcare professionals in the United States based on the federal court declaration described below. In March 2016, we reached agreement with the FDA and U.S.
government under which they agreed to be bound by the terms of the August 2015 judicial declaration. Vascepa is available in the United States by prescription only. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

turn resell Vascepa to retail pharmacies for subsequent resale to patients and healthcare providers. We market Vascepa in the United States through our direct sales force of approximately 150 sales professionals, including sales representatives and
their managers. In March 2014, we entered into a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-promotion</FONT> agreement in the United States with Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. under which no less than 250 Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. sales

condition in which patients have high levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream. It is estimated that over 70&nbsp;million adults in the United States have elevated triglyceride levels (TG <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT>150 mg/dL),
approximately 40&nbsp;million adults in the United States have high triglyceride levels (TG <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT>200 mg/dL), and approximately 4.0&nbsp;million people in the United States have severely high triglyceride
levels (TG <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT>500 mg/dL), commonly known as very high triglyceride levels. Many patients with high triglyceride levels also have diabetes and other lipid level abnormalities such as high cholesterol. The
patient condition of having more than one lipid level abnormality is referred to as mixed dyslipidemia. According to <I>The American Heart Association Scientific Statement on Triglycerides and Cardiovascular Disease </I>(2011), triglycerides provide
important information as a marker associated with the risk for heart disease and stroke, especially when an individual also has low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">HDL-C</FONT> (often referred to as
&#147;good&#148; cholesterol), and elevated levels of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">LDL-C</FONT> (often referred to as &#147;bad&#148; cholesterol). Guidelines for the management of very high triglyceride levels suggest that reducing triglyceride
levels is the primary goal in patients to reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis. The effect of Vascepa on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, or the risk for pancreatitis, in patients with hypertriglyceridemia has not been determined.

to be available and published in 2018. In addition, since its inception in 2011, our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> special protocol assessment (SPA) agreement with the FDA has provided for periodic safety reviews and an interim
efficacy and safety analysis by the study&#146;s independent data monitoring committee (DMC) at approximately 60% of the target aggregate number of primary cardiovascular events. In August 2016, we announced an amendment to our <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> SPA agreement with FDA that reaffirmed FDA concurrence on key elements of the study, defined details of the statistical analysis plan for the study, expanded to greater than 30 the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-specified</FONT> secondary and tertiary endpoints in the study, and added a second interim efficacy and safety analysis by the DMC at approximately 80% of the target aggregate number of primary cardiovascular events.
The periodic safety reviews and interim efficacy and safety analyses are conducted confidentially by the study&#146;s DMC. We remain blinded to all data from the study. Since patient enrollment commenced in 2011, more than 26,000 patient years of
study experience have been accumulated in the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> study. Following each periodic review of safety data to date, the DMC has communicated to us that we should continue the study as planned. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In March 2016, we announced that the onset of approximately 60% of the target aggregate number of primary cardiovascular events had
triggered preparation for the first <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-specified</FONT> interim analysis of efficacy and safety results. Such analysis included the first review of unblinded efficacy data by the independent DMC. The DMC completed
its review of the interim analysis in September 2016 and, consistent with previously stated expectations, recommended that the trial continue as planned without modification. The second planned interim analysis of efficacy results will be triggered
by the onset of approximately 80% of the target aggregate number of primary cardiovascular events in the study. Based on historical event rates, we anticipate that the onset of approximately 80% of events will occur in the first half of 2017, with
the second <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-specified</FONT> interim efficacy analysis by the DMC expected in or about the third quarter of 2017. The interim efficacy analysis will be accompanied by an interim safety analysis by the DMC. As is
typical, the statistical threshold for defining overwhelming efficacy on the primary endpoint at interim analyses is considerably higher than the threshold for defining statistical significance at the end of the study. In addition, we have requested
the DMC to not recommend stopping the study early based only upon the achievement of statistical significance for the primary endpoint, but to ensure that supportive trends of benefit are also consistently observed in certain secondary endpoints and
subpopulations before recommending that the study be stopped early for overwhelming efficacy. This is the same approach we asked the DMC to employ in connection with the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> study 60% interim analysis.

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In April 2015, we received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA in response to
our supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, that sought approval of Vascepa for use in patients with mixed dyslipidemia, based on the successful ANCHOR study. The CRL followed an October 2013 rescission by the FDA of a special protocol
assessment, or SPA, agreement and three failed attempts by us to appeal that rescission at FDA. The FDA has acknowledged the success of the ANCHOR study, which met all primary and secondary endpoints. However, FDA determined that there were
insufficient data to conclude that drug-induced changes in serum triglycerides could be recognized by the FDA as a valid surrogate for reducing cardiovascular risk in the ANCHOR population for the purpose of regulatory approval of a drug targeted at
a triglyceride-lowering indication in this population. The FDA has acknowledged that the standard of proof required by the FDA for approval of a new drug indication is higher than that generally used to inform patient treatment guidelines and that
used by physicians in clinical practice. The FDA did not determine that the drug-induced effects of Vascepa, which go beyond triglyceride-lowering, would not actually reduce cardiovascular risk in this population and the FDA has encouraged us to
complete the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> outcomes study. Based on our communications with the FDA, we expect that final positive results from the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> outcomes study will be required

permit us to promote to healthcare professionals the use of Vascepa in patients with mixed dyslipidemia so long as the promotion is truthful and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-misleading.</FONT> This use reflects recognized medical practice
but is not covered by current <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> labeling for the drug. Historically, FDA has considered promotion of drug uses not covered by FDA approved labelling to be illegal
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> promotion, even if such promotion is truthful and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-misleading.</FONT> In August 2015, we were granted preliminary relief in the form of a declaratory judgment in
this lawsuit. The court declaration permits us to promote to healthcare professionals the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-reviewed</FONT> and agreed effects of Vascepa demonstrated in the ANCHOR clinical trial and presentation of the current
state of scientific research related to the potential of Vascepa to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease including through use of peer-reviewed scientific publications of available data. In August 2015, we began to communicate promotional
information beyond the MARINE indication to healthcare professionals in the United States as permitted by this court declaration and in March 2016, the parties obtained court approval of negotiated settlement terms under which the FDA and the U.S.
government agreed to be bound by the court&#146;s conclusions from the August 2015 declaration that we may engage in truthful and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-misleading</FONT> speech promoting the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> use of Vascepa and that certain statements and disclosures that we proposed to make to healthcare professionals were truthful and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-misleading.</FONT> While we
believe we are now permitted under applicable law to more broadly promote Vascepa, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> labeling for Vascepa did not change, as a result of this litigation and settlement, and neither government
nor other third-party coverage or reimbursement to pay for the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> use of Vascepa promoted under the court declaration was required. </FONT></P>

Vascepa prescriptions for the three months ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 was approximately 286,000 compared to 260,000, 230,000, 201,000, and 191,000 in the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2016,&nbsp;June&nbsp;30, 2016,&nbsp;March&nbsp;31,
2016, and December&nbsp;31, 2015, respectively. According to data from another third party, IMS Health, the estimated number of normalized total Vascepa prescriptions for the three months ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 was approximately 312,000

total number of Vascepa prescriptions shipped to patients, calculated on a normalized basis (i.e., one month&#146;s supply, or total capsules shipped multiplied by the number of grams per capsule divided by 120 grams). Inventory levels at
wholesalers tend to fluctuate based on seasonal factors, prescription trends and other factors. During 2016, predominantly in the second quarter, wholesaler inventory levels increased based on estimated days of inventory on hand. In addition,
regional stocking of Vascepa expanded at certain retail pharmacies, likely due to higher volume sales of Vascepa. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The data
reported above is based on information made available to us from third-party resources and may be subject to adjustment and may overstate or understate actual prescriptions. Timing of shipments to wholesalers, as used for revenue recognition

inconsistent from period to period. We believe that investors should view the above-referenced operating metrics with caution, as data for this limited period may not be representative of a trend consistent with the results presented or otherwise
predictive of future results. Seasonal fluctuations in pharmaceutical sales, for example, may affect future prescription trends of Vascepa, as could changes in prescriber sentiment, quarterly changes in Distributor purchases, and other factors.
These fluctuations from multiple variables make it difficult to predict quarterly prescription trends and product revenues on a consistent basis. We believe investors should consider our results over several quarters, or longer, before making an
assessment about potential future performance. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The commercialization of pharmaceutical products is a complex undertaking, and

scientific rationale for the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> study is also supported by research on the putative cardioprotective effects of EPA as presented in scientific literature. It is possible that the effects of EPA may be
due not to a single mode of action, such as triglyceride lowering, but rather to multiple mechanisms working together. Studies in the scientific literature explore potentially beneficial effects of EPA on multiple atherosclerosis processes,
including endothelial function, oxidative stress, foam cell formation, inflammation/cytokines, plaque formation/progression, platelet aggregation, thrombus formation, and plaque rupture. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> study is

reimbursements, (c)&nbsp;reserves for expected product returns and (d)&nbsp;estimated costs of incentives offered to certain indirect customers, including patients. The gross to net deductions are estimated based on available actual information,

inventory held in the distribution channel. A hypothetical 5% change in estimated aggregate bottles of channel inventory would result in a change of less than 1% in net product revenues reported during each of the three and twelve months ended

Instruments&#151;Overall (Subtopic <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">825-10):</FONT> Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities</I>. The new guidance is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial
instruments by requiring separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables) within the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the
financial statements, eliminating the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized
cost within the balance sheet, requiring public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, requiring equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity
method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, and requiring a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income
the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as &#147;own credit&#148;) when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in
accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments, among others. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The new guidance permits early
adoption of the own credit provision. We are currently evaluating the accounting, transition and disclosure requirements of the standard and cannot currently estimate the financial statement impact of adoption. </FONT></P>

normalized total Vascepa prescriptions. Based on data provided by Symphony Health Solutions and IMS Health, estimated normalized total Vascepa prescriptions increased by approximately 339,000 and 378,000, respectively, over the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2015, representing growth of 53% and 56%, respectively. During 2016, predominantly in the second quarter, wholesaler inventory levels increased based on estimated days of inventory on hand. In addition, regional stocking of Vascepa
expanded at certain retail pharmacies, likely due to higher volume sales of Vascepa. We estimate that these changes in channel inventory increased net product revenue by approximately $3.0&nbsp;million to $6.0&nbsp;million during 2016, compared to a
$0.4&nbsp;million to $0.7&nbsp;million decrease in net product revenue due to net inventory level changes during 2015. We believe that changes in channel inventory at these independent wholesalers and retail pharmacies are common and impacted by
numerous factors, including holiday timing and recent order trends. We also believe, based on information available to us, that channel inventory levels at the end of both 2015 and 2016 are within ordinary ranges. </FONT></P>

Cost of goods sold includes the cost of API for Vascepa on which revenue was recognized during the period, as well as the associated costs for encapsulation, packaging, shipment, supply management, insurance and quality assurance. The cost of the

which is designed to evaluate the efficacy of Vascepa, including its impact on triglyceride lowering and its other clinical effects, in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events compared to placebo in patients who despite statin therapy have risk
factors for cardiovascular disease, including elevated triglyceride levels. In 2016, we completed patient enrollment and randomization of 8,175 individual patients into the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> study, exceeding the 8,000
patients targeted for the trial. The study duration is dependent on the rate of clinical events in the study, which rate may be affected by the epidemiology of the patients enrolled in the study and the length of time that the enrolled patients are
followed. We manage the study through a contract research organization (CRO) through which all costs for this outcomes study are incurred with the exception of costs for clinical trial material (CTM) and costs for internal management. Our internal
personnel are responsible for managing multiple projects and their costs are not specifically allocated to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> or any other individual project. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, we
incurred expenses through our CRO in connection with this trial of approximately $28.8&nbsp;million and $28.5&nbsp;million, respectively. Inclusive of CTM costs, the combined CRO and CTM costs during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015
for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> were approximately $37.0&nbsp;million and $34.7&nbsp;million, respectively. The increase in expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily the result of timing variability for <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> costs. We expense costs for CTM when allocated to clinical research. The aggregate cost of this outcomes study will depend on the rate of clinical events in the study. We currently estimate that we will
incur $30&nbsp;million to $40&nbsp;million in annual costs through study completion and the rate at which we incur such costs will vary from quarter to quarter. The study is designed to be completed after reaching 1,612 aggregate primary
cardiovascular events. Based on projected event rates, we estimate the onset of the target aggregate number of cardiovascular events to be reached near the end of 2017 with study results then expected to be available and published in 2018. We
anticipate that our costs for this outcomes study will continue to represent the most significant component of our research and development expenditures. </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

which net remaining unpaid amount as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 was $125.6&nbsp;million. Unless this early redemption feature is triggered, the remaining amount, without additional interest accumulation, is anticipated to be paid based on the royalty

date on which we executed a separate subscription agreement with the investor, resulting in a charge of $0.9&nbsp;million through gain (loss) on change in fair value of derivatives in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The liability of
$1.8&nbsp;million was then reclassified to permanent equity on March&nbsp;30, 2015. There was no such change in fair value of derivative liability for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The change in fair value of the derivative liability related to the BioPharma financing agreement is largely related to our projections
for future estimated revenues, management estimates of the probability of a change in control occurring, and the terms of debt issues of similar companies. The change in fair value of the derivative liabilities related to the 2014 Notes and 2015
Notes is a result of the exchange of the related debt hosts for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and was largely related to changes in quoted bond prices for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. Any changes in the assumptions used to value
the derivative liabilities could result in a material change to the carrying value of such liabilities. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Gain on
Extinguishment of Debt. </I>In November 2015, we entered into a privately negotiated subscription agreement with one of our existing investors (the &#147;Investor&#148;), pursuant to which the Investor agreed to purchase approximately
$31.3&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of new 3.5%&nbsp;November 2015 Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2032 (the &#147;2015 Notes&#148;) for approximately $27.5&nbsp;million. Concurrent with the issuance of the 2015 Notes, we entered into
separate, privately negotiated purchase agreements with certain holders of the 3.5%&nbsp;January 2012 Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2032 (the &#147;2012 Notes&#148;) pursuant to which we purchased approximately $16.2&nbsp;million in aggregate
principal amount of the 2012 Notes for $15.9&nbsp;million (the &#147;2012 Notes Purchase&#148;), which includes accrued but unpaid interest on such 2012 Notes. The 2012 Notes Purchase was funded by the issuance of the 2015 Notes. Following the
closing of the 2012 Notes Purchase, we had approximately $15.1&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of 2012 Notes outstanding. The 2012 Notes Purchase was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt and we recorded a gain of $1.3&nbsp;million
upon extinguishment for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, which represents the reacquisition of the conversion option at fair value and a negotiated discount on the purchase of the notes partially offset by legal and transaction advisory costs
incurred. There was no such gain on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Interest Expense,

stock purchase option was determined to be a derivative liability effective March&nbsp;5, 2015, the date in which the private placement was initially subscribed. The fair value of this liability was calculated using a Black-Scholes model and was
determined to be $0.9&nbsp;million at inception. The liability was charged to accumulated deficit as a deemed <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cash</FONT> dividend and was therefore reflected as an adjustment to net loss applicable to common
shareholders for earnings per common share purposes in accordance with GAAP for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. There was no such adjustment to net loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Preferred Stock Beneficial Conversion Features</I>. In 2015, we issued Series A preference shares in a private placement transaction
executed in two tranches that each contain a conversion feature whereby such shares are convertible into ordinary shares at a fixed rate (see Note 10&#151;Equity). The conversion price on the date of issuance was less than the market price of our
ordinary shares on such date. We determined that these discounts represent contingent beneficial conversion features, which were valued based on the difference between the conversion price and the market price of the ordinary shares on the date of
issuance. These features are analogous to preference dividends and were recorded as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cash</FONT> returns to preferred shareholders through accumulated deficit, and are therefore reflected as adjustments to net
loss applicable to common shareholders for earnings per common share purposes in accordance with GAAP. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we recorded an adjustment to net loss applicable to common shareholders of $31.3&nbsp;million upon
effectiveness of the related resale Registration Statement on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">S-3</FONT> and $1.6&nbsp;million upon shareholder approval received at the Company&#146;s Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. There was no such
adjustment to net loss in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. </FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Product Revenue, net.</I> We recorded product revenue of $81.0&nbsp;million and $54.2&nbsp;million during the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $26.8&nbsp;million, or 49%. This increase in revenue was driven by an increase in estimated normalized total Vascepa prescriptions of approximately 228,000 and 258,000 based on data
provided by Symphony Health Solutions and IMS Health, respectively, representing growth of 55% and 62%, respectively, over the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The difference in the percentage of revenue growth as compared to the percentage of
prescription growth is primarily due to a change in revenue recognition methodology in 2014 as described below. The level of inventories held by our customers as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 was slightly lower as compared to inventories held as of
December&nbsp;31, 2014 based on days on hand. All of our product revenue in the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 was derived from product sales of Vascepa, net of allowances, discounts, incentives, rebates, chargebacks and returns. In
accordance with GAAP, prior to 2014, product revenue was recognized based on the resale of Vascepa for the purposes of filling patient prescriptions and not based on sales to our Distributors. During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014, we
concluded that we had developed sufficient history such that we can reliably estimate returns and, as a result, began to recognize product revenue based on sales to our Distributors. Through December&nbsp;31, 2015, product returns of Vascepa were de
minimis. Timing of shipments to wholesalers, as used for revenue recognition, and timing of prescriptions as estimated by third-party sources such as Symphony Health Solutions and IMS Health may differ from period to period. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, our net product revenue included an adjustment for
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-pay</FONT> mitigation rebates provided by us to commercially insured patients. Such rebates are intended to offset the differential for patients of Vascepa not covered by commercial insurers at the time of launch
on Tier 2 for formulary purposes, resulting in higher <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-pay</FONT> amounts for such patients. Our cost for these <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-payment</FONT> mitigation rebates was up to $75 per prescription
filled prior to February&nbsp;20, 2014 and up to $70 per prescription filled after February&nbsp;20, 2014. Since launch, certain third-party payors have added Vascepa to their Tier 2 coverage, which results in lower
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-payments</FONT> for patients covered by these third-party payors. In connection with such Tier 2 coverage, we have agreed to pay customary rebates to these third-party payors on the resale of Vascepa to patients
covered by these third-party payors. As is typical for the pharmaceutical industry, the majority of Vascepa sales are to major commercial wholesalers which then resell Vascepa to retail pharmacies. </FONT></P>

licensing revenue prior to 2015. The licensing revenue relates to the amortization of a $15.0&nbsp;million <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">up-front</FONT> payment received in February 2015 associated with a Vascepa licensing agreement for the China
Territory. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">up-front</FONT> payment is being recognized over the estimated period in which we are required to provide regulatory and development support and clinical and commercial supply, which is currently
anticipated to be a period of approximately 16 years. The amount of licensing revenue recorded may be variable from period to period based on changes in estimates of the timing and level of support required. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Cost of Goods Sold.</I> Cost of goods sold during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 was $27.9&nbsp;million and
$20.5&nbsp;million, respectively, an increase of $7.4&nbsp;million, or 36%. Cost of goods sold includes the cost of API for Vascepa on which revenue was recognized during the period, as well as the associated costs for encapsulation, packaging,
shipment, supply management, insurance and quality assurance. The cost of the API included in cost of goods sold reflects the average cost of API included in inventory. This average cost reflects the actual purchase price of Vascepa API. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The API included in the calculation of the average cost of goods sold was sourced from three API suppliers for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2015 and from two API suppliers for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The contracted cost of supply from our initial API supplier was higher than the contracted cost from our other API suppliers. In the future, we anticipate
making continued purchases from this initial supplier and to make additional lower unit cost purchases of Vascepa API from other API suppliers, with the amount of such purchases dependent on the rate of our revenue growth. </FONT></P>

advantages derived from the mix of our suppliers. The average cost may be variable from period to period depending upon the timing and quantity of API purchased from each supplier. </FONT></P>

which is designed to evaluate the efficacy of Vascepa in reducing major cardiovascular events in a high-risk patient population on statin therapy. The study duration is dependent on the rate of clinical events in the study, which rate may be
affected by the number of patients enrolled in the study, the epidemiology of the patients enrolled in the study, and the length of time that the enrolled patients are followed. We manage the study through a CRO through which all costs for this
outcomes study are incurred with the exception of costs for CTM and costs for internal management. Our internal personnel are responsible for managing multiple projects and their costs are not specifically allocated to
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> or any other individual project. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred expenses through our CRO in connection with this trial of approximately $28.5&nbsp;million and
$31.0&nbsp;million, respectively. Inclusive of CTM costs, the combined CRO and CTM costs during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> were approximately $34.7&nbsp;million and
$37.7&nbsp;million, respectively. The decrease in expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily the result of timing variability for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> costs. We expense costs for CTM when allocated to clinical
research. The aggregate cost of this outcomes study will depend on the rate of clinical events in the study. We currently estimate we will incur $30&nbsp;million to $40&nbsp;million in annual costs through study completion and the rate at which we
incur such costs will vary from quarter to quarter. The study is designed to be completed after reaching 1,612 aggregate primary cardiovascular events. Based on projected event rates, we estimate the onset of the target aggregate number of
cardiovascular events to be reached in or about 2017 with study results then expected to be available and published in 2018. We anticipate that our costs for this outcomes study will continue to represent the most significant component of our
research and development expenditures. </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

should the Daily VWAP (as defined in the Indenture) exceed $2.86 for a certain number of days and reducing the conversion price (see Note 8). As a result of the exchange, we assessed the value of the notes immediately prior to the exchange and

January&nbsp;9, 2012, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Corsicanto Designated Activity Company (formerly Corsicanto Limited), or Corsicanto, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of Ireland, we completed a private placement of
$150.0&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of 3.5% exchangeable senior notes due 2032, or the 2012 Notes. The proceeds we received from the January 2012 debt offering were approximately $144.3&nbsp;million, net of fees and transaction costs.
On May&nbsp;20, 2014, we entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of the 2012 Notes pursuant to which Corsicanto exchanged $118.7&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of the 2012 Notes for
$118.7&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of new 3.5%&nbsp;May 2014 Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2032, or the 2014 Notes. In November 2015, $16.2&nbsp;million of the 2012 Notes was extinguished, following which $15.1&nbsp;million in
aggregate principal amount of the 2012 Notes remained outstanding with terms unchanged. Also in November 2015, we entered into a privately negotiated subscription agreement with one of our existing investors or the Investor, pursuant to which the
Investor agreed to purchase approximately $31.3&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of new 3.5%&nbsp;November 2015 Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2032, or the 2015 Notes, for approximately $27.5&nbsp;million. In September 2016, we exercised
our optional exchange rights upon satisfaction of specified equity conditions set forth in the 2014 Notes and 2015 Notes to mandatorily exchange the entirety of the 2014 Notes and 2015 Notes into ADSs, such that the only exchangeable senior notes

2012 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.5%&nbsp;per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January&nbsp;15 and July&nbsp;15 of each year, beginning on July&nbsp;15, 2012. The notes mature on January&nbsp;15, 2032, unless earlier repurchased,

intention in early 2017 to increase purchases of API. In addition, certain customers have indicated their intent to negotiate extended payment terms with us, which would result in slower collections of receivables. We believe that our cash and cash

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On December&nbsp;6, 2012, we entered into an agreement with BioPharma Secured Debt Fund II Holdings Cayman LP, or BioPharma. Under this agreement, we granted to BioPharma a security interest in future
receivables associated with the Vascepa patent rights, in exchange for $100.0&nbsp;million received at the closing of the agreement which occurred in December 2012. We agreed to repay BioPharma up to $150.0&nbsp;million of future revenue and
receivables. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the net remaining amount to be repaid to BioPharma is $125.6&nbsp;million. To date, each payment made has reflected the calculated optional reduction amount as opposed to the contractual threshold payments
for each quarterly period. For example, based on our Vascepa net product revenue for 2016 of $129.0&nbsp;million, the amount repaid to BioPharma based on 2016 revenue was $12.9&nbsp;million compared to the maximum contractual threshold for 2016 of
$55.0&nbsp;million. The maximum amount payable under the contractual threshold for the first half of 2017 is $16.8&nbsp;million, after which the maximum amount payable is subject to the calculated threshold limitation based on quarterly Vascepa
revenues. In accordance with the agreement with BioPharma, quarterly differences between the calculated optional reduction amounts and the repayment schedule amounts are rescheduled for payment after 2016 and any such deferred payments will remain
subject to continued application of the quarterly ceiling in amounts due established by the calculated threshold for royalty based on quarterly Vascepa revenues. No additional interest expense or liability is incurred as a result of such deferred
repayments and no cliff payment of the remaining balance is due except in the event of Company default or Company change of control. The agreement does not expire until $150.0&nbsp;million in aggregate has been repaid. We can prepay an amount equal
to $150.0&nbsp;million less any previously repaid amount. </FONT></P>

patients with severe (TG <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT>500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia. Vascepa is available in the United States by prescription only. In January 2013, the Company began selling and marketing <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">1-gram</FONT> size Vascepa capsules in the United States, and in October 2016, introduced a smaller <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">0.5-gram</FONT> size capsule. In August 2015, in addition to marketing Vascepa for severe
hypertriglyceridemia, the Company commenced marketing Vascepa for use in adult patients with mixed dyslipidemia, as an adjunct to diet and an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">add-on</FONT> to statin therapy in patients who despite statin therapy
have high triglycerides (TGs <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT>200 mg/dL and <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#163;</FONT>500 mg/dL), which the Company also refers to as persistently high triglycerides. This expanded promotion of
Vascepa commenced pursuant to a federal court order and is continuing pursuant to an agreement among the Company, the FDA and the U.S. government. The Company sells Vascepa principally to a limited number of major wholesalers, as well as selected
regional wholesalers and specialty pharmacy providers, or collectively, its Distributors or its customers, that in turn resell Vascepa to retail pharmacies for subsequent resale to patients and healthcare providers. The Company markets Vascepa
through its direct sales force of approximately 150 sales professionals, including sales representatives and their managers. In May 2014, Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. commenced <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-promotion</FONT> of Vascepa in
accordance with a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-promotion</FONT> agreement with the Company. Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-promotes</FONT> Vascepa through its no less than 250 sales representatives who
now devote a substantial portion of their time to promoting Vascepa in conjunction with the promotion of Kowa Pharmaceutical America, Inc.&#146;s primary product, a branded statin for patients with high cholesterol. The Company operates in one
business segment. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company is also developing Vascepa for FDA approval of potential additional indications for use. In particular, the
Company is conducting a cardiovascular outcomes study of Vascepa, titled <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT> (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with EPA&#151;Intervention Trial). The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">REDUCE-IT</FONT>
study, which commenced in 2011 and completed patient enrollment and randomization of 8,175 individual patients in 2016, is designed to evaluate the efficacy of Vascepa in reducing major cardiovascular events in a high-risk patient population on
statin therapy. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I><U>Basis of Presentation </U></I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

$98.3&nbsp;million. Cash and cash equivalents as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 includes net proceeds of approximately $64.6&nbsp;million resulting from the issuance of 24,265,000 American Depositary Shares, or ADSs, as part of a public offering
completed in August 2016 (see Note 10&#151;Equity). The Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheets also include long-term debt from royalty-bearing instrument and exchangeable senior notes. The terms of the January 2012 3.5% exchangeable senior
notes due 2032, or the 2012 Notes, are such that they may be redeemed by the Company on or after January&nbsp;19, 2017 and may be put back to the Company by the holders on each of January&nbsp;19, 2017, 2022 and 2027 for cash equal to 100% of the
principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The 2012 Notes are exchangeable under certain circumstances into cash, American Depositary Shares, or ADSs, or a combination of cash and ADSs, at the Company&#146;s election. Accordingly,
$15.1&nbsp;million in principal amount of 2012 Notes represents a short-term claim on the liquid assets of the Company as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. In September 2016, the Company mandatorily exchanged $118.7&nbsp;million in aggregate principal
amount of May 2014 3.5% exchangeable senior notes due 2032, or the 2014 Notes, and $31.3&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of November 2015 3.5% exchangeable senior notes due 2032, or the 2015 Notes, into ADSs such that they were retired in
full, and derecognized the related derivative liabilities. In January 2017, holders of the 2012 Notes exercised their option to put the 2012 Notes to the Company for cash. As a result, the Company repurchased approximately $15.0&nbsp;million in
aggregate principal amount of 2012 Notes, such that $0.1&nbsp;million in principal amount of 2012 Notes currently remains outstanding. In contemplation of this repurchase, the Company issued $30.0&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of
January 2017 3.5% exchangeable senior notes due 2047, or the 2017 Notes. The Company has initiated the process to redeem the remaining $0.1&nbsp;million of 2012 Notes, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2017. Refer to Note
8&#151;Debt and Note 18&#151;Subsequent Events for further discussion. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company believes its cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient

<P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The use of forecasted financial information is inherent in many of the Company&#146;s accounting estimates including, but not limited to, determining the
estimated fair values of derivatives, debt instruments and intangible assets, evaluating the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, and assessing the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. Such forecasted financial
information is comprised of numerous assumptions regarding the Company&#146;s future revenues, cash flows, and operational results. Management believes that its financial forecasts are reasonable and appropriate based upon current facts and
circumstances. Because of the inherent nature of forecasts, however, actual results may differ from these forecasts. Management regularly reviews the information related to these forecasts and adjusts the carrying amounts of the applicable assets
prospectively, if and when actual results differ from previous estimates. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I><U>Revenue Recognition

purchase Vascepa. In accordance with GAAP, the Company&#146;s revenue recognition policy requires that: (i)&nbsp;there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists between the Company and the Distributor, (ii)&nbsp;delivery has occurred,
(iii)&nbsp;collectability is reasonably assured and (iv)&nbsp;the price is fixed or determinable. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company has contracts with its primary
Distributors and delivery generally occurs when a Distributor receives Vascepa. The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of each of its Distributors to determine whether revenues can be recognized upon delivery, subject to satisfaction of the
other requirements, or whether recognition is required to be delayed until receipt of payment. In order to conclude that the price is fixed or determinable, the Company must be able to (i)&nbsp;calculate its gross product revenues from the sales to
Distributors and (ii)&nbsp;reasonably estimate its net product revenues. The Company calculates gross product revenues generally based on the wholesale acquisition cost that the Company charges its Distributors for Vascepa. The Company estimates its
net product revenues by deducting from its gross product revenues (a)&nbsp;trade allowances, such as invoice discounts for prompt payment and distributor fees, (b)&nbsp;estimated government and private pay or rebates, chargebacks and discounts, such
as Medicaid reimbursements, (c)&nbsp;reserves for expected product returns and (d)&nbsp;estimated costs of incentives offered to certain indirect customers, including patients. </FONT></P>

payment and pays fees for distribution services, such as fees for certain data that Distributors provide to the Company. The payment terms for sales to Distributors generally include a 2% discount for payment within 30 days while the fees for
distribution services are based on contractual rates agreed with the respective Distributors. Based on judgment and experience, the Company expects its Distributors to earn these discounts and fees, and deducts the full amount of these discounts and

to the labeled expiration date and ending twelve months after the labeled expiration date. The expiration date for Vascepa is three years after it has been converted into capsule form, which is the last step in the manufacturing process for Vascepa
and generally occurs within a few months before Vascepa is delivered to Distributors. The Company estimates future product returns on sales of Vascepa based on: (i)&nbsp;data provided to the Company by its Distributors (including weekly reporting of
Distributors&#146; sales and inventory held by Distributors that provided the Company with visibility into the distribution channel in order to determine what quantities were sold to retail pharmacies and other providers), (ii)&nbsp;information

<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The consideration received is allocated between each of the separable elements in the arrangement using the relative selling price method. The selling
price used for each separable element will be based on vendor specific objective evidence (&#147;VSOE&#148;) if available, third-party evidence if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor third-party evidence is
available. Revenue is then recognized as each of the separable elements to which the revenue has been allocated is delivered. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company may
receive <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">up-front,</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-refundable</FONT> payments when licensing its intellectual property in conjunction with research, development and commercialization agreements. In
determining the units of accounting, management evaluates whether the license has stand-alone value from the undelivered elements to the collaborative partner based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement.
Factors considered in this determination include the stage of development of the license delivered, research and development capabilities of the partner and the ability of partners to develop and commercialize Vascepa independent of the Company.

in the arrangement, the Company generally recognizes revenue attributable to the license over the Company&#146;s contractual or estimated performance period. Any unrecognized portion of license revenue is classified within deferred revenue in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. When management believes the license to its intellectual property has stand-alone value, the Company recognizes revenue attributed to the license upon delivery. The periods over which revenue is recognized
is subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the agreement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue the Company records in future periods. </FONT></P>

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In April 2016, the Company adopted ASU <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">No.&nbsp;2016-09,</FONT> <I>Compensation&#151;Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting,</I> which changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. One aspect of the standard requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies that arise upon vesting or exercise of share-based payments be
recognized as an income tax benefit and expense in the income statement. Previously, such amounts were recognized as an increase and decrease in additional <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">paid-in</FONT> capital. This aspect of the standard was
adopted prospectively and, accordingly, the provision for income taxes for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 includes $0.4&nbsp;million of excess tax deficiencies arising from share-based payments. Additionally, the new standard requires that
historical excess tax benefits that were not previously recognized because the related tax deduction had not reduced current taxes payable should be recognized on a modified retrospective basis as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings
as of the beginning of the annual period of adoption. Consequently, the Company recognized deferred tax assets of approximately $1.6&nbsp;million relating to excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2015,
with a corresponding cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit. The new standard also amends the presentation of employee share-based payment-related items in the statement of cash flows by requiring that: (i)&nbsp;excess income tax
benefits and deficiencies be classified in cash flows from operating activities, and (ii)&nbsp;cash paid to taxing authorities arising from the withholding of shares from employees be classified as cash flows from financing activities. The Company
adopted the aspects of the standard affecting cash flow presentation retrospectively and, accordingly, reclassified $0.7&nbsp;million of excess tax benefit and $2.3&nbsp;million of excess tax provision from cash flows provided by financing
activities to cash flows used in operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, to conform to the current year presentation. The presentation requirement for cash
flows related to taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows since such payments have historically been presented as a financing activity. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company&#146;s and its subsidiaries&#146; income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. The Company is currently under
audit by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years 2013 to 2014. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, the Company does not believe the outcome of these audits
will have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial position or results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company&#146;s December 2012 financing agreement with BioPharma Secured Debt Fund II Holdings Cayman LP (discussed in Note 8&#151;Debt) contains a
redemption feature whereby, upon a change of control, the Company would be required to repay $150.0&nbsp;million, less any previously repaid amount. The Company determined this redemption feature to be an embedded derivative, which is carried at
fair value and is classified as Level&nbsp;3 in the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs. The fair value of the embedded derivative was calculated using a probability-weighted model incorporating management
estimates of future revenues and for a potential change in control, and by determining the fair value of the debt with and without the change in control provision included. The difference between the two was determined to be the fair value of the
embedded derivative. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the fair value of the derivative was determined to be nil based on current assumptions, and the debt was valued by comparing debt issues of similar companies with (i)&nbsp;remaining terms of between
2.4 and 5.0 years, (ii)&nbsp;coupon rates of between 8.1% and 11.1% and (iii)&nbsp;market yields of between 11.9% and 18.4%. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the fair value of the derivative was determined to be $5.5&nbsp;million, and the debt was
valued by comparing debt issues of similar companies with (i)&nbsp;remaining terms of between 2.0 and 7.3 years, (ii)&nbsp;coupon rates of between 6.6% and 12.5% and (iii)&nbsp;market yields of between 13.0% and 30.7%. As such, the Company
recognized a $5.5&nbsp;million gain on change in fair value of derivative liability for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The
Company&#146;s 2014 Notes and 2015 Notes each contained a redemption feature whereby, upon occurrence of a change in control, the Company would have been required to repurchase the notes. The Company determined these redemption features to be
embedded derivatives, requiring bifurcation in accordance with ASC 815. The derivatives were carried at fair value and were classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs. The fair value of each
embedded derivative was calculated using a probability-weighted model incorporating management estimates of the probability of a change in control occurring, and by determining the fair value of the debt with and without the change in control
provision included. The difference between the two was determined to be the fair value of the embedded derivative. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, derivatives related to the 2014 Notes and 2015 Notes were each derecognized, as the related debt hosts
were exchanged into equity in September 2016. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the fair values of the derivatives related to the 2014 Notes and 2015 Notes were determined to be $2.1&nbsp;million and $0.6&nbsp;million, respectively, and the debts were
valued by using (i)&nbsp;the estimated remaining term of the notes, (ii)&nbsp;a bond yield of 25.6%, (iii)&nbsp;a risk-free interest rate of 2.9% and (iv)&nbsp;volatility of 89.0%. As such, the Company recognized a gain on change in fair value of

ASU <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">No.&nbsp;2016-09,</FONT> <I>Compensation&#151;Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,</I> which changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments
to employees. One aspect of the standard requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies that arise upon vesting or exercise of share-based payments be recognized as an income tax benefit and expense in the income statement. Previously, such
amounts were recognized as an increase and decrease in additional <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">paid-in</FONT> capital. This aspect of the standard was adopted prospectively, and accordingly, the provision for income taxes for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2016 includes $0.4&nbsp;million of excess tax deficiencies arising from share-based payments. Additionally, the new standard requires that historical excess tax benefits that were not previously recognized because the related tax
deduction had not reduced current taxes payable should be recognized on a modified retrospective basis as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual period of adoption. Consequently, the Company recognized
deferred tax assets of approximately $1.6&nbsp;million relating to excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, with a corresponding cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit. The new standard
also amends the presentation of employee share-based payment-related items in the statement of cash flows by requiring that: (i)&nbsp;excess income tax benefits and deficiencies be classified in cash flows from operating activities, and
(ii)&nbsp;cash paid to taxing authorities arising from the withholding of shares from employees be classified as cash flows from financing activities. The Company adopted the aspects of the standard affecting cash flow presentation retrospectively
and, accordingly, reclassified $0.7&nbsp;million of excess tax benefit and $2.3&nbsp;million of excess tax provision from cash flows provided by financing activities to cash flows used in operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash
flows as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, to conform to the current year presentation. The presentation requirement for cash flows related to taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods presented in the
consolidated statement of cash flows since such payments have historically been presented as a financing activity. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In December 2016, the

the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost within the balance sheet,
requiring public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, requiring equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those
that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, and requiring a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total
change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as &#147;own credit&#148;) when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair

<P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On October&nbsp;16, 2009, the Company completed a $70.0&nbsp;million private placement with both existing and new investors resulting in
$62.3&nbsp;million in net proceeds and an additional $3.6&nbsp;million from bridge notes converted in conjunction with the private placement. In consideration for the $62.3&nbsp;million in net cash proceeds Amarin issued 66.4&nbsp;million units,
each unit consisting of (i)&nbsp;one ADS (representing one ordinary share) at a purchase price of $1.00 and (ii)&nbsp;a warrant with a five year term to purchase 0.5 (one half) of an ADS at an exercise price of $1.50 per ADS. In consideration for
the conversion of $3.6&nbsp;million of convertible bridge notes, Amarin issued 4.0&nbsp;million units, each unit consisting of (i)&nbsp;one ADS (representing one ordinary share) at a purchase price of $0.90 and (ii)&nbsp;a warrant with a five year
term to purchase 0.5 (one half) of an ADS at an exercise price of $1.50 per ADS. The total number of warrants issued in conjunction with the financing was 35.2&nbsp;million. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In conjunction with the October 2009 financing, the Company issued an additional 0.9&nbsp;million warrants to three former officers. The warrants issued in connection with the October 2009 financing
contained a pricing variability feature which provided for an increase to the exercise price if the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and British pound adjusts such that the warrants could be exercised at a price less than the &pound;0.5 par
value of the common stock&#151;that is, if the exchange rate exceeded U.S. $3.00 per &pound;1.0 sterling. Due to the potential variable nature of the exercise price, the warrants were not considered to be indexed to the Company&#146;s common stock.
Accordingly, the warrants did not qualify for the exception to classify the warrants within equity and were classified as a derivative liability. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The fair value of this warrant derivative liability was remeasured at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. Upon exercise, the fair
value of the warrants exercised was remeasured and reclassified from warrant derivative liability to additional <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">paid-in-capital.</FONT></FONT> Although the warrants contained a
pricing variability feature, the number of warrants issuable remained fixed. Therefore, the maximum number of common shares issuable as a result of the October 2009 private placement was 36.1&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In October 2014, the Company and the holders of the remaining October 2009 warrants mutually agreed to extend the expiration date of such warrants from
October&nbsp;16, 2014 to February&nbsp;27, 2015. Of the 8,087,388 warrants outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, 1,844,585 warrants were exercised, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $2.7&nbsp;million, and the remaining 6,242,803

future receivables associated with the Vascepa patent rights, in exchange for $100.0&nbsp;million received at the closing of the agreement which occurred in December 2012. Under these terms, the
Company continues to own all Vascepa intellectual property rights, however, such rights, as described below, could be used by BioPharma as collateral for repayment of the remaining unpaid balance under this agreement if the Company defaults on
making required payments. In the agreement, the Company agreed to repay BioPharma up to $150.0&nbsp;million with such repayment based on a portion of revenues and receivables generated from Vascepa. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the remaining amount to be repaid to BioPharma is $125.6&nbsp;million. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, the
Company made repayments under the agreement of $11.7&nbsp;million to BioPharma and an additional $3.8&nbsp;million is scheduled to be paid in February 2017 for the fourth quarter of 2016. These payments were calculated based on the threshold
limitation, as described below, as opposed to the scheduled quarterly repayments. Additional quarterly repayments, subject to the threshold limitation, are scheduled to be paid. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The final maximum contractual quarterly amount which could be due for payment, except upon a change of control and subject to the threshold limitation, is $13.0&nbsp;million scheduled for payment in May
2017. All such payments reduce the remainder of the $150.0&nbsp;million in aggregate payments to BioPharma. These quarterly payments are subject to a quarterly threshold amount whereby, if a calculated threshold, based on quarterly Vascepa revenues,
is not achieved, the quarterly payment payable in that quarter can at the Company&#146;s election be reduced, with the reduction carried forward without interest for payment in a future period. The payment of any carried forward amount is subject to
similarly calculated threshold repayment amounts based on Vascepa revenue levels. Except upon a change of control in Amarin, the agreement does not expire until $150.0&nbsp;million in aggregate has been repaid. Except in the event of the
Company&#146;s default, there is no compounding of interest and no scheduled cliff payment due under this agreement. Rather, payment will be made, subject to the threshold limitation, until $150.0&nbsp;million in aggregate has been repaid, including
payments made previously. The Company can prepay an amount equal to $150.0&nbsp;million less any previously repaid amount. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company
currently estimates that its Vascepa revenue levels will not be high enough in each quarter to support repayment to BioPharma in accordance with the maximum quarterly amounts in the repayment schedule. For each quarterly period since the inception
of the debt, revenues were below the contractual threshold amount such that cash payments were calculated for each period reflecting the optional reduction amount as opposed to the contractual threshold payment due for each quarterly period. In
accordance with the agreement with BioPharma, quarterly differences between the calculated optional reduction amounts and the repayment schedule amounts are rescheduled for payment beginning in the second quarter of 2017. Any such deferred
repayments will remain subject to continued application of the quarterly ceiling in amounts due established by the calculated threshold limitation based on quarterly Vascepa revenues. No additional interest expense or liability is incurred as a
result of such deferred repayments. These estimates will be reevaluated each reporting period by the Company and adjusted if necessary, prospectively. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company determined the redemption feature upon a change of control to be an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. The fair value of the embedded derivative was calculated by determining the fair
value of the debt with the change in control provision included and also without the change in control provision. The difference between the two fair values of the debt was determined to be the fair value of the embedded derivative, and upon closing
the Company recorded a derivative liability of $14.6&nbsp;million as a reduction to the note payable. The fair value of this derivative liability is remeasured at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated
statement of operations and any changes in the assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the derivative liability could result in a material increase or decrease in its carrying value. Based on current assumptions underlying the valuation, the
Company recognized a $5.5&nbsp;million gain on change in fair value of derivative liability during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, as compared to a $0.7&nbsp;million loss on change in fair value of derivative liability during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2015 </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying value of the BioPharma debt, net of the unamortized debt discount

$150.0&nbsp;million in principal amount of 3.5% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2032 (the &#147;2012 Notes&#148;), a portion of which was subsequently exchanged and a portion of which was extinguished (see discussion of May 2014 and November 2015
Exchangeable Senior Notes below), such that $15.1&nbsp;million in principal amount remains outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. In January 2017, holders of the 2012 Notes exercised their option to put the 2012 Notes to the Company. As a result,
the Company repurchased approximately $15.0&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of 2012 Notes, such that $0.1&nbsp;million in principal amount of 2012 Notes currently remains outstanding. Also in January 2017, in contemplation of this
surrender of 2012 Notes for repurchase, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Corsicanto II Designated Activity Company (&#147;Corsicanto II&#148;) entered into separate, privately negotiated purchase agreements with certain investors

the 2012 Notes are not freely tradable, as a result of restrictions pursuant to U.S. securities law or the terms of the 2012 Notes indenture or the 2012 Notes, the Company shall pay additional interest on the 2012 Notes at the rate of 0.50%&nbsp;per
annum of the principal amount of 2012 Notes outstanding for each day during such period for which the Company&#146;s failure to file has occurred and is continuing or for which the 2012 Notes are not freely tradable. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company may not redeem the 2012 Notes prior to January&nbsp;19, 2017, other than in connection with certain changes in the tax law of a relevant
taxing jurisdiction that results in additional amounts becoming due with respect to payments and/or deliveries on the 2012 Notes. On or after January&nbsp;19, 2017 and prior to the maturity date, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the
2012 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2012 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. There is no prepayment penalty or sinking fund provided for the 2012
Notes. If the Company undergoes a change in control, holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their 2012 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2012 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued
and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the change in control repurchase date. The 2012 Notes are the Company&#146;s senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to the Company&#146;s future indebtedness that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the 2012 Notes and equal in right of payment to the Company&#146;s future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated. The 2012 Notes are effectively junior in right of payment to future secured
indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The 2012 Notes are exchangeable under certain
circumstances. At the time of issuance, the Company calculated the fair value of the liability component of the outstanding 2012 Notes to be $126.2&nbsp;million, and the excess of the principal amount of the debt over the liability component of
$23.8&nbsp;million was allocated to the conversion option resulting in a discount on the debt and corresponding increase in equity as a result of the cash settlement feature. The discount created from allocating proceeds to the conversion option was
amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the 2012 Notes&#146; estimated remaining life, which was calculated to be a period of twenty-four months. As of both December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, the discount created from
the allocation of the proceeds to the conversion option was fully amortized and the carrying amount of the conversion option was $11.5&nbsp;million. The conversion option will not be subsequently remeasured as long as it continues to meet the
criteria for equity classification. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company also recorded a debt discount to reflect the value of the underwriter&#146;s discounts and
offering costs. A portion of the debt discount from underwriter&#146;s discounts and offering costs was allocated to the equity and liability components of the 2012 Notes in proportion to the proceeds allocated to each component. The portion of the
debt discount from underwriter&#146;s discounts and offering costs allocated to the liability component was amortized as interest expense over the estimated life of the 2012 Notes of twenty-four months. As of both December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015,
the debt discount was fully amortized and the carrying value of the 2012 Notes was $15.1&nbsp;million after an exchange and repayment of a portion of the 2012 Notes (see below for further discussion of the May 2014 Notes and November 2015 Notes).
The outstanding 2012 Notes may be put to the Company (at the holders&#146; option, upon fundamental change or an event of default), or converted by holders and the holders have the option to put the 2012 Notes back to the Company on each of
January&nbsp;19, 2017, 2022 and 2027 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a result, the carrying value of the 2012 Notes of $15.1&nbsp;million is classified as a current liability as of

principal amount of the 2014 Notes for equity with settlement in September 2016, such that all of the outstanding 2014 Notes were retired. In the event of physical settlement, the 2014 Notes were initially exchangeable into 45,666,925 ADSs. The
initial exchange rate was 384.6154 ADSs per $1,000 principal amount of the 2014 Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $2.60 per ADS, or the Exchange Price), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including, but not
limited to, the payment of cash dividends or the Company&#146;s exercise of its optional exchange rights. Consistent with the 2014 Notes indenture, the final <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">as-adjusted</FONT> exchange rate was 402.0746 ADSs per

filed a lawsuit against Roxane Laboratories, Inc. and related parties (collectively, &#147;Roxane&#148;) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada. The case against Roxane is captioned <I>Amarin Pharma, Inc. et al. v. Roxane

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2:16-cv-02658.</FONT></FONT> In all three lawsuits, Amarin is seeking, among other remedies, an order enjoining each defendant from marketing generic versions of Vascepa before the

Act, the FDA cannot grant final approval to Roxane, DRL, or Teva&#146;s respective ANDA before January 2020, unless there is an earlier court decision holding that the subject patents are not infringed and/or are invalid. </FONT></P>

The notice reflected that Apotex made a paragraph IV notice as to some, but not all, of the patents listed in the Orange Book for Vascepa. Because Apotex did not make a paragraph IV certification as to all listed patents, Apotex cannot market a
generic version of Vascepa before the last to expire of the patents for which Apotex did not make a paragraph IV certification, which is in 2030. At a later date, Apotex may elect to amend its ANDA in order to make a paragraph IV certification as to
additional listed patents. If and when Apotex does make such an amendment, it would be required to send Amarin an additional paragraph IV certification notice, and Amarin would then have the ability to file a lawsuit against Apotex pursuant to the
Hatch-Waxman Act. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company intends to vigorously enforce its intellectual property rights relating to Vascepa, but cannot predict the

liability was then marked to fair value as of March&nbsp;30, 2015, the date on which the Company executed a subscription agreement with Sofinnova, resulting in a charge of $0.9&nbsp;million through gain (loss) on change in fair value of derivatives.
The liability of $1.8&nbsp;million was reclassified to permanent equity (additional <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">paid-in</FONT> capital) on such date. Subsequent to approval of the Second Private Placement at the Company&#146;s Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders in July 2015, the Company recorded the remaining value of the BCF related to this share issuance as a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cash</FONT> dividend to preferred shareholders through accumulated deficit. The value
of the BCF was determined on the same basis as the first private placement and amounted to $3.4&nbsp;million less $1.8&nbsp;million previously recorded for the preferred stock purchase option for a net

Accounting</I>. The Company early adopted this standard during the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2016, without electing to change its existing accounting policy of accounting for forfeitures based on expected vesting. The new standard requires that
excess tax benefits and deficiencies that arise upon vesting or exercise of share-based payments be recognized as an income tax benefit and expense in the income statement, and also that historical excess tax benefits that were not previously
recognized because the related tax deduction had not reduced current taxes payable should be recognized on a modified retrospective basis as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual period of adoption.
Further, the new standard amends the presentation of employee share-based payment-related items in the statement of cash flows by requiring that: (i)&nbsp;excess income tax benefits and deficiencies be classified in cash flows from operating
activities, and (ii)&nbsp;cash paid to taxing authorities arising from the withholding of shares from employees be classified as cash flows from financing activities. Refer to Note 2&#151;Significant Accounting Policies above for additional
discussion on the Company&#146;s adoption of the new standard. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In June 2014, the FASB issued guidance for accounting for share-based payments
when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. The standard states that a performance target in a share-based payment that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the
requisite service period should be accounted for as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. The guidance became effective for all entities during the
first quarter of fiscal 2016. The Company previously accounted for awards in a manner consistent with the new guidance and as such, adoption of the guidance did not have any impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. </FONT></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">During 2016, the Company recorded adjustments to its deferred tax accounts related to the impact of foreign
exchange rate changes and to reconcile the financial statement accounts to the amounts reported on its filed 2015 foreign tax returns, primarily for the impact of U.S. GAAP to local statutory adjustments. The majority of these adjustments were fully
offset with valuation allowances based on the Company&#146;s position with respect to the realizability of its recorded deferred tax assets. The Company is subject to corporate tax rate in Ireland of 25% for
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-trading</FONT> activities and 12.5% for trading activities. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Company applied the statutory corporate tax rate of 25% for Amarin Corporation plc,
reflecting the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-trading</FONT> tax rate in Ireland. However, for Amarin Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amarin Corporation plc, the Company applied the 12.5% Irish trading tax rate.
In the table above, the Company used Amarin Corporation plc&#146;s 25% tax rate as the starting point for the reconciliation since it is the parent entity of the business. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2015-17,</FONT> Income Taxes (Topic 740): &#147;Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes&#148;, which changes how deferred
taxes are classified on organizations&#146; balance sheets. The ASU eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-current</FONT> in a
classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-current.</FONT> The Company early adopted ASU
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2015-17</FONT> effective December&nbsp;31, 2015 on a prospective basis. Adoption of this ASU resulted in a reclassification of $0.9&nbsp;million of the net current deferred tax asset to the net <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-current</FONT> deferred tax asset in the consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In April 2016, the Company adopted ASU <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">No.&nbsp;2016-09,</FONT> Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Share-Based Payment Accounting which changes
the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. One aspect of the standard requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies that arise upon vesting or exercise of share-based payments be recognized as an income tax benefit
and expense in the income statement. Previously, such amounts were recognized as an increase and decrease in additional <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">paid-in</FONT> capital. This aspect of the standard was adopted prospectively, and accordingly
the provision for income taxes for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 includes $0.4&nbsp;million of excess tax deficiencies arising from share-based payments during the period of adoption. Additionally, the new standard requires that historical
excess tax benefits were not previously recognized because the related tax deduction had not reduced current taxes should be recognized on a modified retrospective basis as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of
the annual period of adoption. Consequently, the Company recognized deferred tax assets of approximately $1.6&nbsp;million relating to excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, with a corresponding
cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The income tax effect of each type of temporary difference comprising the net deferred

expire. The total net operating loss carryforwards increased by approximately $8.1&nbsp;million from the prior year primarily as a result of current year losses generated by the Company&#146;s Irish subsidiaries, partially offset by the impact of
foreign exchange rate changes and adjustments to reconcile the financial statement accounts to the amounts reported on the filed 2015 foreign tax returns. In addition, the Company has U.S. Federal tax credit carryforwards of $6.7&nbsp;million and
state tax credit carryforwards of $1.6&nbsp;million. These amounts exclude the impact of any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances. These carryforwards, which will expire starting between 2024 and 2036 may be used to offset future
taxable income, if any. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, earnings of $25.1&nbsp;million have been retained indefinitely for reinvestment by
foreign subsidiary or there is an expectation that any reinvestment can be recovered <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-free</FONT> without significant cost, and the entity expects to ultimately use that means of recovery for domestic subsidiary
companies; therefore, no provision has been made for income taxes that would be payable upon the distribution of such earnings and it would not be practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax liability.
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company&#146;s and its subsidiaries&#146; income tax returns are periodically examined by various taxing authorities. The Company is
currently under audit by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years 2013 to 2014. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in significant cash tax payments, the Company does not believe the outcome
of these audits will have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial position or results of operations. </FONT></P>

shareholders on July&nbsp;12, 2011. The 2011 Plan replaced the Company&#146;s 2002 Stock Option Plan (&#147;2002 Plan&#148;), which expired on January&nbsp;1, 2012. The maximum number of the Company&#146;s Ordinary Shares of &pound;0.50 each or any

one Series A Preference Share, which may be consolidated and redesignated from time to time up to a maximum of 3,886,718 ordinary shares, each ordinary share to be represented by one ADS. For each restricted ADS, Sofinnova paid a negotiated price of
