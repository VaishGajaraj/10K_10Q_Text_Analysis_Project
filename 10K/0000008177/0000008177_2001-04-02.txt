ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

THE COMPANY

         Atlantic American Corporation, a Georgia corporation (the "Parent" or
"Company") incorporated in 1968, is a holding company that operates through its
subsidiaries in well-defined specialty markets of the life, health, property and
casualty insurance industries. Atlantic American's principal subsidiaries are
American Southern Insurance Company and American Safety Insurance Company
(collectively known as "American Southern"), Association Casualty Insurance
Company ("ACIC"), Georgia Casualty & Surety Company, ("Georgia Casualty") and
Bankers Fidelity Life Insurance Company ("Bankers Fidelity").

         On July 1, 1999 the Company, for an aggregate price of $33.0 million,
acquired 100% of outstanding stock of Association Casualty Insurance Company
("ACIC") and its affiliated agency, Association Risk Management General Agency,
Inc ("ARMGA"), both of which are domiciled in Texas. The acquisition of both
companies was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Together
ACIC and ARMGA are referred to as Association Casualty. In addition, on April 1,
1999 the Company merged American Independent Life Insurance Company ("American
Independent") into Bankers Fidelity completing the consolidation of these two
companies whose operations had been assimilated following the acquisition of
American Independent in 1997.

         The Company's strategy is to focus on well-defined geographic,
demographic and/or product niches within the insurance market place. The
underwriting function of each of the Company's subsidiaries operates with
relative autonomy which allows for quick reaction to market opportunities. In
addition, the Company seeks to develop and expand cross-selling opportunities
and other synergies among its subsidiaries as they arise.

         CASUALTY OPERATIONS

         The Company's casualty operations are composed of three distinct
entities, American Southern, Association Casualty and Georgia Casualty. The
primary products offered by the casualty group are described below, followed by
an overview of each company.

         Workers' Compensation Insurance policies provide indemnity and medical
benefits to insured workers for injuries sustained in the course of their
employment.

         Business Automobile Insurance policies provide for bodily injury and/or
property damage liability coverage, uninsured motorists coverage, and physical
damage coverage to commercial accounts.

         General Liability Insurance policies cover bodily injury and property
damage liability for both premises and completed operations exposures for
general classes of business.

         Property Insurance policies provide for payment of losses on real and
personal property caused by fire and other multiple perils.

         Personal Automobile Insurance policies provide for bodily injury and
property damage liability coverage, uninsured motorists coverage, and physical
damage coverage for individuals.

         AMERICAN SOUTHERN. American Southern provides tailored fleet automobile
and long-haul physical damage insurance coverage, on a multi-year contract
basis, to state governments, local municipalities and other large motor pools
and fleets ("block accounts") that can be specifically rated and underwritten.
The size of the block accounts insured by American Southern are such that
individual class experience generally can be determined, which allows for
customized policy terms and rates. American Southern produces business in 23 of
the 24 states in the Southeast and Midwest in which it is authorized to conduct
business. Additionally, American Southern provides personal automobile insurance
to the members of the Carolina Motor Club, an AAA affiliate. While the majority
of American Southern's premiums are derived from auto liability and auto
physical damage, American Southern also provides property, general liability and
surety coverage.

         The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, the
allocation of American Southern's net earned premiums for each of its principal
product lines since its acquisition by the Company:

         GEORGIA CASUALTY. Georgia Casualty is a property-casualty insurance
company which provides workers' compensation, commercial property, general
liability and automobile insurance in the Southeastern United States.

         While Georgia Casualty has historically written business in industries
that are perceived to be high risk, it has recently begun to focus on
diversifying its book of business. Currently, Georgia Casualty is targeting
retail, light manufacturing, service, and other lower hazard risks. Georgia
Casualty is licensed to do business in thirteen Southeastern states; however,
historically it has focused its efforts on Georgia, Mississippi, and Northern
Florida. Along with the diversification of its book of business, Georgia
Casualty is in the process of expanding geographically, with added focus on the
states of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.

         The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, the

MARKETING

         CASUALTY OPERATIONS

         AMERICAN SOUTHERN. American Southern's business is marketed through a
small number of specialized, experienced independent agents. Most of American
Southern's agents are paid a moderate up-front commission with the potential for
additional commission by participating in a profit sharing arrangement that is
directly linked to the profitability of the business generated. In addition, a
significant portion (approximately 46.8% of total written premium in 2000) of
American Southern's premiums are assumed from third parties. In arrangements
similar to those with its agents, the premium assumed from these parties is
adjusted based upon the profitability of the assumed business. During 1998,
American Southern formed American Auto Club Insurance Agency, LLC in a 50/50
joint venture with the AAA Carolinas to market personal automobile insurance to
the members of the automobile club. The program, which began writing business in
1999, had gross written premiums of approximately $7.2 million during 2000.

         ASSOCIATION CASUALTY. Association Casualty is represented by a field
force of approximately 130 independent agents for the sale and distribution of
its insurance products. Each agency is a party to a standard agency contract
that sets forth the commission structure and other terms and can be terminated
by either party. Marketing efforts are handled by an experienced staff of
insurance professionals.

         GEORGIA CASUALTY. Georgia Casualty is represented by a field force of
approximately 80 independent agents for the sale and distribution of its
insurance products. Each agency is a party to a standard agency contract that
sets forth the commission structure and other terms and can be terminated by
either party upon thirty days written notice. Georgia Casualty also offers a
contingent profit-sharing arrangement that allows the most profitable agents to
earn additional commissions when specific loss experience and premium growth
goals are achieved. Marketing efforts, directed by experienced marketing
professionals, are complemented by the underwriting, risk management, and audit
staffs of Georgia Casualty, who are available to assist agents in the
presentation of all insurance products and services to their insureds. Georgia
Casualty has also begun marketing programs that include endorsements from trade
organizations and business franchises.

         BANKERS FIDELITY

         Bankers Fidelity markets its policies through commissioned, independent
agents. In general, Bankers Fidelity enters contractual arrangements with
general agents who, in turn, contract with independent agents. The standard
agreements set forth the commission arrangements and are terminable by either
party upon thirty days written notice. General agents receive an override
commission on sales made by agents contracted by them. Management believes
utilizing direct writing, experienced agents, as well as independent general
agents who recruit and train their own agents, is cost effective. All
independent agents are compensated on a pure commission basis. Using independent
agents also enables Bankers Fidelity to expand or contract their sales forces at
any time without incurring significant additional expense.

         Bankers Fidelity has implemented a selective agent qualification
process and had 2,342 licensed agents in 2000. The agents concentrate their
sales activities in either the accident and health or life insurance product
lines. During 2000, a total of 1,384 agents wrote policies on behalf of Bankers
Fidelity.

         Products of Bankers Fidelity compete directly with products offered by
other insurance companies, as agents may represent several insurance companies.
Bankers Fidelity, in an effort to motivate agents to market their products,
offers the following agency services: a unique lead system, competitive products
and commission structures, efficient claims service, prompt payment of
commissions, simplified policy issue procedures, periodic sales incentive
programs and, in some cases, protected sales territories consisting of counties
and/or zip codes.

         The company utilizes a distribution sales system which is centered
around a lead generation plan that rewards qualified agents with leads in
accordance with monthly production goals. In addition, a protected territory is
established for each qualified agent, which entitles them to all leads produced
within that territory. The territories are zip code or county based and
encompass enough physical territory to produce a minimum senior population of
12,000. In addition, Bankers Fidelity recruits at a general agent level rather
than at a managing general agent level in an effort to reduce commission
expenses further.

         The Company believes this distribution system solves an agent's most
important dilemma -- prospecting -- and allows Bankers Fidelity to build
long-term relationships with individual producers who view Bankers Fidelity as
their primary company. In addition, management believes that Bankers Fidelity's
product line is less sensitive to competitor pricing and commissions because of
the perceived value of the protected territory and the lead generation plan.
Through this distribution channel, production per agent contracted increased
substantially when compared to Bankers Fidelity's general brokerage division.

UNDERWRITING

         CASUALTY OPERATIONS

         American Southern specializes in the handling of block accounts such as
states and municipalities that generally are sufficiently large to establish
separate class experience, relying upon the underwriting expertise of its
agents. In contrast, Georgia Casualty and Association Casualty underwrite the
majority of their accounts in-house.

         During the course of the policy year, extensive use is made of risk
management representatives to assist underwriters in identifying and correcting
potential loss exposures and to pre-inspect the majority of the new accounts
that are underwritten. The results of each product line are reviewed on a
stand-alone basis. When the results are below expectations, management takes
appropriate corrective action which may include raising rates, reviewing
underwriting standards, reducing commissions paid to agents, altering or
declining to renew accounts at expiration, and/or terminating agencies with an
unprofitable book of business.

         American Southern also acts as a reinsurer with respect to all of the
risks associated with certain automobile policies issued by state administrative
agencies, naming the state and various local governmental entities as insureds.
Premiums written from such policies constituted $22.2 million of American
Southern's gross premiums written in 2000. For 2000, premiums assumed of $24.5
million, include a single state contract of $17.2 million. These contracts are
periodically subject to competitive renewal quotes and the loss of a significant
contract could have a material adverse effect on the business or financial
condition of the company. (see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the year ended December 31, 2000.)

         BANKERS FIDELITY

         Bankers Fidelity Life issues a variety of products for both health and
life to include Medicare Supplements and single and multiple premium life with
face amounts of not less than $1,000 and up. The majority of our products are
`Yes' or `No' applications which are underwritten on a non-medical basis. The
company offers products to all age groups, but primarily to the senior market.
For life products other than the senior market, the company may require medical
information such as medical examinations subject to age and face amount based on
published guidelines. For example, such medical information is ordered for all
applicants regardless of age and face amounts of $50,000 and above. For face
amounts of $5,000 to $49,999 medical information is ordered only for ages 51 and
above. Approximately, 95% of the net premiums earned for both health and life
insurance sold during 2000 were derived from insurance written below Bankers
Fidelity's medical limits. For the senior market, the company issues products on
an accept-or-reject basis with face amounts up to $30,000 for ages 45-70,
$20,000 for ages 71-80 and $10,000 for ages 81-85. Banker's Fidelity retains a
maximum amount of $50,000 with respect to any individual life (see
"Reinsurance").

Applications for insurance are reviewed to determine the face amount, age, and
medical history. Depending upon this information and information obtained from
the Medical Information Bureau (M.I.B.) report, paramedical requirements,
medical records, and, where indicated, special tests are ordered. If deemed
necessary, the company may use investigative services to supplement and
substantiate information. For certain limited coverages, Bankers Fidelity has
adopted simplified policy issue procedures by which an application containing a
variety of Yes/No health related questions is submitted. For these plans,
paramedical requirements and medical records are not ordered. Presently,
approximately 20-30% of all applications for individuals under age 80 are
verified by telephone interview with the client. For ages 80 and above, 100% of
applications are verified by telephone interview.

POLICYHOLDER AND CLAIMS SERVICES

         The Company believes that prompt, efficient policyholder and claims
services are essential to its continued success in marketing its insurance
products (see "Competition"). Additionally, the Company believes that its
insureds are particularly sensitive to claim processing time and to the
accessibility of qualified staff to answer inquiries. Accordingly, the Company's
policyholder and claims services include expeditious disposition of service
requests by providing toll-free access to all customers, 24-hour claim reporting
services, and direct computer links with some of its largest accounts. The
Company also utilizes a state-of-the-art automatic call distribution system to
insure timely response. Inbound calls to customer service support groups are
processed efficiently. Operational data generated from this system allows
management to further refine ongoing client service programs and service
representative training modules.

         The Company supports a Customer Awareness Program as the basis for its
customer service philosophy. All personnel are required to attend customer
service classes. Hours have been expanded in all service areas to serve
customers and agents in all time zones.

         CASUALTY OPERATIONS

         American Southern, Association Casualty, and Georgia Casualty control
their claims costs by utilizing an in-house staff of claim supervisors to
investigate, verify, negotiate and settle claims. Upon notification of an
occurrence purportedly giving rise to a claim, the claims department conducts a
preliminary investigation, determines whether an insurable event has occurred
and, if so, records the claim. The companies frequently utilize independent
adjusters and appraisers to service claims which require on-site inspections.

         BANKERS FIDELITY

         Insureds obtain claim forms by calling the claims department customer
service group. To shorten claim processing time, a letter detailing all
supporting documents that are required to complete a claim for a particular
policy is sent to the customer along with the correct claim form. With respect
to life policies, the claim is entered into Bankers Fidelity's claims system
when the proper documentation is received. Properly documented claims are
generally paid within three to nine business days of receipt.

         CASUALTY OPERATIONS

         Atlantic American Corporation's casualty operations maintain loss
reserves representing estimates of amounts necessary for payment of losses and
LAE. The casualty operations also maintain incurred but not reported reserves
and bulk reserves for future development. These loss reserves are estimates,
based on known facts and circumstances at a given point in time, of amounts the
insurer expects to pay on incurred claims. All balances are reviewed annually by
qualified independent actuaries. Reserves for LAE are intended to cover the
ultimate costs of settling claims, including investigation and defense of
lawsuits resulting from such claims. Loss reserves for reported claims are based
on a case-by-case evaluation of the type of claim involved, the circumstances
surrounding the claim, and the policy provisions relating to the type of loss.
The LAE for claims reported and claims not reported is based on historical
statistical data and anticipated future development. Inflation and other factors
which may affect claim payments are implicitly reflected in the reserving
process through analysis of cost trends and reviews of historical reserve
results; however, it is difficult to measure the effect of any one of these
considerations on reserve estimates.

         The casualty operations establish reserves for claims based upon: (a)
management's estimate of ultimate liability and claim adjusters' evaluations for
unpaid claims reported prior to the close of the accounting period, (b)
estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on past experience, and (c)
estimates of LAE. The estimated liability is continually reviewed and updated,
and changes to the estimated liability are recorded in the statement of
operations in the year in which such changes become known.

         The table on the following page sets forth the development of balance
sheet reserves for unpaid losses and LAE for the casualty operations' insurance
lines for 1990 through 2000, including periods prior to the Company's ownership
of American Southern and Association Casualty. The top line of the table
represents the estimated amount of losses and LAE for claims arising in all
prior years that were unpaid at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated
periods, including an estimate of losses that have been incurred but not yet
reported. The amounts represent initial reserve estimates at the respective
balance sheet dates for the current and all prior years. The next portion of the
table shows the cumulative amounts paid with respect to claims in each
succeeding year. The lower portion of the table shows the reestimated amounts of
previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each
succeeding year.

The reserve estimates are modified as more information becomes known about the
frequency and severity of claims for individual years. The "cumulative
redundancy or deficiency" for each year represents the aggregate change in such
year's estimates through the end of 2000. In evaluating this information, it
should be noted that the amount of the redundancy or deficiency for any year
represents the cumulative amount of the changes from initial reserve estimates
for such year. Operations for any one year are only affected, favorably or
unfavorably, by the amount of the change in the estimate for such year.
Conditions and trends that have affected development of the reserves in the past
may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it is inappropriate to
predict future redundancies or deficiencies based on the data in this table.

         BANKERS FIDELITY

         Bankers Fidelity establishes future policy benefits reserves to meet
future obligations under outstanding policies. These reserves are calculated to
satisfy policy and contract obligations as they mature. The amount of reserves
for insurance policies is calculated using assumptions for interest rates,
mortality and morbidity rates, expenses, and withdrawals. Reserves are adjusted
periodically based on published actuarial tables with some modification to
reflect actual experience (see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the year ended December 31, 2000).

REINSURANCE

         The insurance subsidiaries purchase reinsurance from unaffiliated
insurers and reinsurers to reduce their liability on individual risks and to
protect against catastrophic losses. In a reinsurance transaction, an insurance
company transfers, or "cedes," a portion or all of its exposure on insurance
policies to a reinsurer. The reinsurer assumes the exposure in return for a
portion of the premiums. The ceding of insurance does not legally discharge the
insurer from primary liability for the full amount of policies written by it,
and the ceding company incurs a loss if the reinsurer fails to meet its
obligations under the reinsurance agreement.

         CASUALTY OPERATIONS

         AMERICAN SOUTHERN. The limits of risks retained by American Southern
vary by type of policy and insured, and amounts in excess of such limits are
reinsured. The largest net amount insured in any one risk is $100,000.
Reinsurance is generally maintained as follows: for fire, inland marine, and
commercial automobile physical damage, recovery of losses over $40,000 up to
$90,000. Net retentions for third party losses are generally over $35,000 up to
$100,000. Catastrophe coverage for all lines except third party liability is for
95% of $6.6 million over $400,000.

         ASSOCIATION CASUALTY. Association Casualty retains not more than the
first $250,000 in losses on its workers' compensation policies; losses in excess
of this limit are reinsured.

         GEORGIA CASUALTY. Georgia Casualty's basic treaties cover all claims in
excess of $200,000 per person, per occurrence on casualty losses, and per risk
on property losses, up to $10.0 million per casualty claim and $5.0 million per
property claim. An excess catastrophe treaty provides coverage up to statutory
limits for any one occurrence on workers' compensation. The property lines of
coverage are protected with an excess of loss treaty which affords recovery for
property losses in excess of $250,000 up to a maximum of $5.0 million.
Facultative arrangements are in place for property and non-workers compensation
casualty risks that require limits in excess of $5.0 million and $10.0 million,
respectively. In 1999, Georgia Casualty entered into a stop-loss reinsurance
program for all losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses in the 1999
accident year that, in the aggregate, fall between 55% and 75% of the net earned
premiums, before the impact of the premium ceded under the treaty. Effective
January 1, 2000, Georgia Casualty discontinued the stop-loss reinsurance
agreement due to improved results.

         BANKERS FIDELITY

         Bankers Fidelity has entered into reinsurance contracts ceding the
excess of their retention to several primary reinsurers. Maximum retention by
Bankers Fidelity on any one individual in the case of life insurance policies is
$50,000. At December 31, 2000, Bankers Fidelity's reinsured annualized premiums
totaled $27.7 million of the $293.6 million of life insurance then in force,
generally under yearly renewable term agreements. Certain reinsurance agreements
that are no longer active for new business remain in force.

are highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing and
service. Many competing property and casualty companies which have been in
business longer than American Southern have available more diversified lines of
insurance and have substantially greater financial resources. Management
believes, however, that the policies it sells are competitive with those
providing similar benefits offered by other insurers doing business in the
states where American Southern operates.

         ASSOCIATION CASUALTY. As a monoline writer of workers' compensation
insurance, Association Casualty's biggest competition comes from carriers that
can provide insureds with all of their commercial insurance needs. In addition,
the State of Texas operates a state workers' compensation pool that competes
directly with the carriers in the state. Association Casualty counters these
competitive issues by offering high quality service. Additionally, Association
Casualty began writing additional commercial coverages in 2000 in an effort to
make itself more competitive.

         GEORGIA CASUALTY. Georgia Casualty's insurance business is highly
competitive. The competition can be placed in four categories: (1) companies
with higher A.M. Best ratings, (2) alternative workers' compensation markets,
(3) self-insured funds, and (4) insurance companies that actively solicit
monoline workers' compensation accounts. Georgia Casualty's efforts are directed
in the following three general categories where the company has the best
opportunity to control exposures and claims: (1) manufacturing, (2) artisan
contractors, and (3) service industries. Management believes that Georgia
Casualty's keys to being competitive in these areas are maintaining strong
underwriting standards, risk management programs, writing workers' compensation
coverages as part of the total insurance package, maintaining and expanding its
loyal network of agents and development of new agents in key territories. In
addition, Georgia Casualty offers quality customer service to its agents and
insureds, and provides rehabilitation, medical management, and claims management
services to its insureds. Georgia Casualty believes that it will continue to be
competitive in the marketplace based on its current strategies and services.

         BANKERS FIDELITY

         The life and health insurance business is highly competitive and
includes a large number of insurance companies, many of which have substantially
greater financial resources. Bankers Fidelity believes that the primary
competitors are the Blue Cross/Blue Shield companies, AARP, the Prudential
Insurance Company of America, Pioneer Life Insurance Company of Illinois, AFLAC,
American Travellers, Kanawha Life, American Heritage, Bankers Life and Casualty
Company, United American Insurance Corporation, and Standard Life of Oklahoma.
Bankers Fidelity competes with other insurers on the basis of premium rates,
policy benefits, and service to policyholders. Bankers Fidelity also competes
with other insurers to attract and retain the allegiance of its independent
agents through commission arrangements, accessibility and marketing assistance,
lead programs, and market expertise. Bankers Fidelity believes that it competes
effectively on the basis of policy benefits, services, and market expertise.

RATING

         The following ratings are not designed for investors and do not
constitute recommendations to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings are
important in the insurance industry, and improved ratings should have a
favorable impact on the ability of the companies to compete in the marketplace.

         In 1999, for the first time, Atlantic American Corporation and its
subsidiaries underwent a rating and review process by Standard & Poor's. As a
result of the review, each of the Company's insurance subsidiaries was assigned
a single "A-" counterparty credit and financial strength rating. This rating was
affirmed in 2000 and now includes Association Casualty.

         On November 1, 2000 these ratings were placed on CreditWatch with
negative implications. On March 14, 2001, Standard & Poor's removed the Company
from CreditWatch and lowered its counterparty credit rating and financial
strength rating to "BBB+"/Neg and "BBB+", respectively from a single "A-".

         Each year A.M. Best Company, Inc. publishes Best's Insurance Reports
("Best's"), which include assessments and ratings of all insurance companies.
Best's ratings, which may be revised quarterly, fall into fifteen categories
ranging from A++ (Superior) to F (in liquidation). Best's ratings are based on
an analysis of the financial condition and operations of an insurance company
compared to the industry in general.

         AMERICAN SOUTHERN. American Southern and its wholly-owned subsidiary,
American Safety Insurance Company, are each currently rated "A-" (Excellent) by
A.M. Best.

         ASSOCIATION CASUALTY. Association Casualty maintains a rating of "A-"
(Excellent) by A.M. Best.

         GEORGIA CASUALTY. Georgia Casualty maintains an A.M. Best's rating of
"B++" (Very Good).

         BANKERS FIDELITY. Bankers Fidelity maintains an A.M. Best's rating of
"B++" (Very Good).

REGULATION

         In common with all domestic insurance companies, the Company's
insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision in the
jurisdictions in which they do business. Statutes typically delegate regulatory,
supervisory, and administrative powers to state insurance commissions. The
method of such regulation varies, but regulation relates generally to the
licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on
investments, approval of policy forms, reserve requirements, the standards of
solvency which must be met and maintained, deposits of securities for the
benefit of policyholders, and periodic examinations of insurers and trade
practices, among other things. The Company's products generally are subject to
rate regulation by state insurance commissions, which require that certain


                                       13
<PAGE>   14

minimum loss ratios be maintained. Certain states also have insurance holding
company laws which require registration and periodic reporting by insurance
companies controlled by other corporations licensed to transact business within
their respective jurisdictions. The Company's insurance subsidiaries are subject
to such legislation and are registered as controlled insurers in those
jurisdictions in which such registration is required. Such laws vary from state
to state but typically require periodic disclosure concerning the corporation
which controls the registered insurers and all subsidiaries of such
corporations, as well as prior notice to, or approval by, the state insurance
commission of intercorporate transfers of assets (including payments of
dividends in excess of specified amounts by the insurance subsidiaries) within
the holding company system.

         Most states require that rate schedules and other information be filed
with the state's insurance regulatory authority, either directly or through a
rating organization with which the insurer is affiliated. The regulatory
authority may disapprove a rate filing if it determines that the rates are
inadequate, excessive, or discriminatory. The Company has historically
experienced no significant regulatory resistance to its applications for rate
increases.

         A state may require that acceptable securities be deposited for the
protection either of policyholders located in those states or of all
policyholders. As of December 31, 2000, $16.2 million of securities were on
deposit either directly with various state authorities or with third parties
pursuant to various custodial agreements on behalf of Bankers Fidelity and the
Casualty Operations.

         Virtually all of the states in which the Company's insurance
subsidiaries are licensed to transact business require participation in their
respective guaranty funds designed to cover claims against insolvent insurers.
Insurers authorized to transact business in these jurisdictions are generally
subject to assessments of up to 4% of annual direct premiums written in that
jurisdiction to pay such claims, if any. The occurrence and amount of such
assessments has increased in recent years. The likelihood and amount of any
future assessments cannot be estimated until an insolvency has occurred. For the
last five years, the amount incurred by the Company was not material.

NAIC RATIOS

         The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the "NAIC") was
established to provide guidelines to assess the financial strength of insurance
companies for state regulatory purposes. The NAIC conducts annual reviews of the
financial data of insurance companies primarily through the application of 13
financial ratios prepared on a statutory basis. The annual statements are
submitted to state insurance departments to assist them in monitoring insurance
companies in their states and to set forth a desirable range in which companies
should fall in each such ratio.

         The NAIC suggests that insurance companies which fall outside of the
"usual" range in four or more financial ratios are those most likely to require
analysis by state regulators. However, according to the NAIC, it may not be
unusual for a financially sound company to have several ratios outside the
"usual" range, and in normal years the NAIC expects 15% of the companies it
tests to be outside the "usual" range in four or more categories.

         For the year ended December 31, 2000, American Southern was within the
NAIC "usual" range for all 13 financial ratios. Association Casualty was outside
the "usual" range on one ratio, the change in net writings, primarily due to the
increase in premium volume. Bankers Fidelity was outside the "usual" range on
two ratios, the net change in capital and surplus and the gross change in
capital and surplus, both due to a decline in unrealized gains related to
several of its equity investments. Georgia Casualty was outside the "usual"
range on four ratios, the change in net writings, the two-year overall operating
ratio, the change in surplus, and the estimated current reserve deficiency to
surplus. The change in net writing variance resulted from the significant
premium growth during 2000. The two-year overall operating ratio and the
estimated current reserve deficiency to surplus were outside the "usual" range
primarily due to adverse development on prior year losses. The change in surplus
variance resulted from a decline in unrealized gains related to several of its
equity investments.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL

         Risk-based capital ("RBC") is used by rating agencies and regulators as
an early warning tool to identify weakly capitalized companies for the purpose
of initiating further regulatory action. The RBC calculation determines the
amount of Adjusted Capital needed by a company to avoid regulatory action.
"Authorized Control Level Risk-Based Capital" ("ACL") is calculated; if a
company's adjusted capital is 200% or lower than ACL, it is subject to
regulatory action. At December 31, 2000, all of the Company's insurance
subsidiaries exceeded the RBC regulatory levels.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

         Certain of the statements and subject matters contained herein that are
not based upon historical or current facts deal with or may be impacted by
potential future circumstances and developments, and should be considered
forward-looking and subject to various risks and uncertainties. Such
forward-looking statements are made based upon management's belief, as well as
assumptions made by and information currently available to management pursuant
to "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Such statements, and the discussion of such subject areas, involve, and
therefore are qualified by, the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding
future expectations generally, and may materially differ from the Company's
actual future experience involving any one or more of such subject areas. The
Company has attempted to identify, in context, certain of the factors that it
currently believes may cause actual future experience and results to differ from
current expectations. The Company's operations and results also may be subject
to the effect of other risks and uncertainties in addition to the relevant
qualifying factors identified elsewhere herein, including, but not limited to,
locality and seasonality in the industries to which the Company offers its
products, the impact of competitive products and pricing, unanticipated
increases in the rate and number of claims outstanding, volatility in the
capital markets that may have an impact on the Company's investment portfolio,
the uncertainty of general economic conditions, and other risks and
uncertainties identified from time to time in the Company's periodic reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Many of such factors are
beyond the Company's ability to control or predict. As a result, the Company's
actual financial condition, results of operations and stock price could differ
materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by the
Company. Undue reliance should not be placed upon forward-looking statements
contained herein. The Company does not intend to publicly update any
forward-looking statements that may be made from time to time by, or on behalf
of, the Company.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

         OWNED PROPERTIES. The Company owns two parcels of unimproved property
consisting of approximately seven acres located in Fulton and Washington
Counties, Georgia. At December 31, 2000, the aggregate book value of such
properties was approximately $46,000.

         LEASED PROPERTIES. The Company (with the exception of American
Southern, Association Casualty, and SIA, Inc.) leases space for its principal
offices in an office building located in Atlanta, Georgia, from Delta Life
Insurance Company, under leases which expire at various times from May 31, 2002
to July 31, 2005. Under the current terms of the leases, the Company occupies
approximately 65,489 square feet of office space. Delta Life Insurance Company,
the owner of the building, is controlled by J. Mack Robinson, Chairman of the
Board of Directors and largest shareholder of the Company. The terms of the
leases are believed by Company management to be comparable to terms which could
be obtained by the Company from unrelated parties for comparable rental
property.

         American Southern leases space for its offices in a building located in
Atlanta, Georgia. The lease term expires January 31, 2010. Under the terms of
the lease, American Southern occupies approximately 17,014 square feet.

         Association Casualty leases space for its principal offices in a
building located in Austin, Texas. The lease term expires December 31, 2005.
Under the terms of the lease, Association Casualty occupies 15,777 square feet.

         SIA, Inc. leases space for its principal offices in a building located
in Stone Mountain, Georgia. The lease term expires December 31, 2003. Under the
terms of the lease, SIA, Inc. occupies 1,787 square feet.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

LITIGATION

         During 2000, American Southern renewed one of its larger accounts.
Although this contract was renewed through a competitive bidding process, one of
the parties bidding for this particular contract contested the award of this
business to American Southern and filed a claim to obtain the nullification of
the contract. During the fourth quarter of 2000, American Southern received an
unfavorable judgment relating to this litigation and has appealed the ruling.
The contract is to remain in effect pending appeal. While management believes
that the effect of an adverse outcome on this case would not materially affect
the current financial position of the Company, it may have a material impact on
the future results of operations of the Company. From time to time, the Company
and its subsidiaries are involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to
and in the ordinary course of their businesses. In the opinion of management,
such claims will not have a material effect on the business or financial
condition of the Company.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

         There were no matters submitted to a vote of the Company's shareholders
during the quarter ended December 31, 2000.

</TABLE>

      The Company has not paid dividends to its common shareholders since the
fourth quarter of 1988. Payment of dividends in the future will be at the
discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend upon the
financial condition, capital requirements, and earnings of the Company as well
as other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. The Company's
primary sources of cash for the payment of dividends are dividends from its
subsidiaries. Under the insurance code of the state of jurisdiction under which
each insurance subsidiary operates, cumulative dividend payments to the Parent
by its insurance subsidiaries are limited to the greater of 10% of accumulated
statutory earnings or statutory net income before recognizing realized
investment gains of the insurance subsidiaries without the prior approval of the
Insurance Commissioner. The Company's principal insurance subsidiaries had the
following accumulated statutory earnings as of December 31, 2000: Georgia
Casualty - $12.7 million, American Southern - $30.1 million, Association
Casualty - $15.4 million, Bankers Fidelity Life - $23.7 million. The Company has
elected to retain its earnings to grow its business and does not anticipate
paying cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS





         To Atlantic American Corporation:


                We have audited in accordance with auditing standards generally
         accepted in the United States, the consolidated financial statements
         included in Atlantic American Corporation's 2000 Annual Report to
         Shareholders, incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and have
         issued our report thereon dated March 27, 2001. Our audits were made
         for the purpose of forming an opinion on those statements taken as a
         whole. The schedules listed in Item 14 (a) are the responsibility of
         the Company's management, are presented for the purpose of complying
         with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules, and are not part
         of the basic consolidated financial statements. These schedules have
         been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the
         basic consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly
         state in all material respects the financial data required to be set
         forth therein in relation to the basic consolidated financial
         statements taken as a whole.

(1)       Under the terms of its tax-sharing agreement with its subsidiaries,
          income tax provisions for the individual companies are computed on a
          separate company basis. Accordingly, the Company's income tax benefit
          results from the utilization of the parent company separate return
          loss to reduce the consolidated taxable income of the Company and its
          subsidiaries.
