     Unless otherwise indicated, the terms "Company" and "Bed Bath & Beyond"
refer collectively to Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and its subsidiaries. The Company's
fiscal year is comprised of the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday
nearest February 28. Accordingly, fiscal 2000 represented 53 weeks and ended on
March 3, 2001; fiscal 1999 represented 52 weeks and ended on February 26, 2000;
and fiscal 1998 represented 52 weeks and ended on February 27, 1999. Unless
otherwise indicated, all references herein to periods of time (e.g., quarters
and years) are to fiscal periods.


ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION

           Bed Bath & Beyond believes that it is the nation's largest operator
of "superstores" selling predominantly better quality domestics merchandise and
home furnishings typically found in better department stores. The term
"superstore" as used herein means a store, other than a department store, that
is larger in size than the typical stores in its market selling similar product
categories and offering a breadth and depth of selection in most of its product
categories that far exceeds what is available in such stores. The Company offers
a wide assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices that are substantially
below regular department store prices and generally comparable to or below
department store sale prices. The Company's domestics merchandise line includes
items such as bed linens, bath accessories and kitchen textiles, and the
Company's home furnishings line includes items such as cookware, dinnerware,
glassware and basic housewares. The Company believes that it offers a breadth
and depth of selection in most of its product categories that far exceeds what
is generally available in department stores or other specialty retail stores and
that this enables it to offer customers the convenience of one-stop shopping for
most household items.

           As of May 1, 2001, the Company operated 316 stores in 43 states:
Alabama (4), Arizona (5), Arkansas (2), California (37), Colorado (8),
Connecticut (6), Delaware (1), Florida (27), Georgia (12), Idaho (1), Illinois
(15), Indiana (5), Iowa (2), Kansas (4), Kentucky (2), Louisiana (3), Maine (1),
Maryland (10), Massachusetts (7), Michigan (14), Minnesota (2), Mississippi (1),
Missouri (5), Nebraska (1), Nevada (1), New Jersey (16), New Mexico (1), New
York (16), North Carolina (7), North Dakota (1), Ohio (12), Oklahoma (3), Oregon
(3), Pennsylvania (15), Rhode Island (2), South Carolina (5), Tennessee (6),
Texas (23), Utah (4), Vermont (1), Virginia (14), Washington (9) and Wisconsin
(2). Of these stores, 313 use the superstore format that was pioneered by the
Company in 1985. These stores are on average approximately 40,000 square feet in
size and carry the Company's full line of both domestics merchandise and home
furnishings. The other three stores, all established prior to 1986, are smaller
stores that primarily carry domestics merchandise.

HISTORY

           The Company was founded in 1971 by Leonard Feinstein and Warren
Eisenberg, the Co-Chief Executive Officers of the Company. Each has more than 40
years of experience in the retail industry.

           The Company commenced operations in 1971 with the opening of two
stores, one in New York and one in New Jersey. These stores sold primarily bed
linens and bath accessories. In 1985, the Company introduced its superstore
format with the opening of its first store carrying a full line of domestics
merchandise and home furnishings. The Company began using the name "Bed Bath &
Beyond" in 1987 in order to reflect the expanded product line offered by its
superstores and to distinguish its superstores from conventional specialty
retail stores offering only domestics merchandise or only home furnishings.




                                       3
<PAGE>   4
           The Company has been engaged in an ongoing expansion program
involving the opening of new superstores (including 70 in 2000, 55 in 1999, and
45 in 1998) and the expansion of existing stores (including two in 2000, four in
1999, and three in 1998). As a result of its expansion program, the Company's
store space has increased from approximately 917,000 square feet at the
beginning of 1992 to approximately 12,204,000 square feet at the end of 2000.
The Company's expansion program is continuing, and the Company currently
anticipates that in fiscal 2001 it will open at least 80 new superstores, which
includes the five new superstores opened through May 1, 2001.


MERCHANDISING AND MARKETING

           The Company's strategy for merchandising and marketing is to offer
better quality merchandise at everyday low prices; to maintain a breadth and
depth of selection in most of its product categories that far exceeds what is
generally available in department stores or other specialty retail stores; to
present merchandise in a distinctive manner designed to maximize customer
convenience and reinforce customer perception of wide selection; and to
emphasize dedication to customer service and satisfaction.

           MERCHANDISE SELECTION

           The Company's superstores offer both domestics merchandise and home
furnishings, including:

           Domestics Merchandise

           -         bed linens and related items: sheets, comforters, duvet
                     covers, bedspreads, quilts, window treatments (such as
                     curtains and valances), decorative pillows, blankets, dust
                     ruffles, bed pillows and mattress pads.

           -         bath items: towels, shower curtains and liners, waste
                     baskets, mirrors, hampers, robes and slippers, scales,
                     bathroom rugs, wall hardware and bath accessories.

           -         kitchen textiles: tablecloths, placemats, cloth napkins,
                     dish towels and chair pads.

           Home Furnishings

           -         kitchen and tabletop items: cookware, cutlery, kitchen
                     gadgets, dinnerware, bakeware, flatware, drinkware,
                     serveware, glassware, food storage containers, tea kettles,
                     trash cans and cleaning supplies.

           -         basic housewares: storage items, closet-related items (such
                     as hangers, organizers and shoe racks), general housewares
                     (such as brooms, garbage pails and ironing boards),
                     lifestyle accessories (such as lamps, chairs, ready to
                     assemble furniture, furniture covers, accent rugs, wicker,
                     fountains and clocks) and small electric appliances (such
                     as blenders, food processors, coffee makers, vacuums,
                     irons, toaster ovens and hair dryers).

           -         general home furnishings: giftwrap, candles, personal care
                     products (such as soaps and lotions), picture frames, wall
                     art, juvenile items (such as toys and children's books),
                     artificial plants and flowers and seasonal merchandise
                     (such as summer and holiday related items).

           The Company, on an ongoing basis, tests new merchandise categories
and adjusts the categories of merchandise carried in its stores and may add new
departments or adjust the size of existing departments as required. The Company
believes that the process of adding new departments and expanding or reducing
the size of various departments in response to changing conditions is an
important part of its merchandising strategy.




                                       4
<PAGE>   5
           The Company's merchandise consists primarily of better quality
merchandise typically found at better department stores. For those product lines
that have brand names associated with them, the Company generally offers leading
brand name merchandise (including All-Clad, Black & Decker, Braun, Brentwood,
Brita, Calphalon, Cannon, Conair, Croscill, Cuisinart, Divatex, Fieldcrest,
Gillette, Homedics, Hoover, J.A. Henckels, Kitchenaid, Krups, Laura Ashley,
Martex, Mikasa, Newell, Pacific Coast Feather Co., Pillowtex, Portmeirion,
Rubbermaid, Springs, Wamsutta and Waverly). The Company estimates that brand
name merchandise accounts for a significant portion of its net sales.

           The Company offers a breadth and depth of product selection that
enables customers to select among a wide assortment of styles, brands, colors
and designs within each of the Company's major product lines. The Company also
generally maintains consistent in-stock availability of merchandise in order to
reinforce customer perception of wide selection and build customer loyalty. The
Company estimates that most of its superstores carry in excess of 30,000 active
stock-keeping units.

           PRICING POLICY

           The Company's pricing policy is to maintain everyday low prices that
are substantially below regular department store prices and generally comparable
to or below department store sale prices. The Company regularly monitors price
levels at its competitors in order to ensure that the Company's prices are being
maintained in accordance with its pricing policy. The Company believes that the
application of its everyday low price policy is essential to maintaining the
integrity of this policy and is an important factor in establishing its
reputation among customers.

           Because the Company has an everyday low price policy, the Company
does not run sales. However, the Company uses periodic markdowns and semi-annual
clearances for merchandise that it has determined to discontinue carrying. In
addition, the Company's full-color circulars and mailing pieces include a
coupon, which is redeemed at the point-of-sale. The Company also honors
competitor coupons.

           MERCHANDISE PRESENTATION

           The Company has developed a distinctive style of merchandise
presentation. In each superstore, groups of related product lines are presented
together in separate areas of the store, creating the appearance that a Bed Bath
& Beyond superstore is comprised of several individual specialty stores for
different product lines. A "racetrack layout" that runs throughout the store
facilitates moving between areas and encourages customers to shop the entire
store. The Company believes that its format of merchandise presentation makes it
easy for customers to locate products, reinforces customer perception of wide
selection and communicates to customers that Bed Bath & Beyond superstores offer
a level of customer service generally associated with smaller specialty stores.

           Merchandise is displayed in each of these separate areas from floor
to ceiling (generally 10 to 14 feet high) and, in addition, seasonal merchandise
and impulse items are prominently displayed in the front of the store. The
Company believes that its extensive merchandise selection, rather than
fixturing, should be the focus of customer attention and, accordingly, typically
uses simple modular fixturing throughout the store. This fixturing is designed
so that it can be easily reconfigured to adapt to changes in the store's
merchandise mix and presentation. The Company believes that its floor to ceiling
displays create an exciting and attractive shopping environment that encourages
impulse purchases of additional items.

           CUSTOMER SERVICE

           The Company places great emphasis on customer service and
satisfaction and, over the past 30 years, has sought to make this a defining
feature of its corporate culture. All managers provide leadership by example in
this area by regularly spending time assisting customers on the selling floor.
The Company believes that its success in the area of customer service is
evidenced by its ability to rely primarily on "word of mouth advertising".

           The Company seeks to make shopping at its stores as pleasant and
convenient as possible. Each area within

                                       5
<PAGE>   6
a store is staffed with knowledgeable sales personnel who are available to
assist customers in choosing merchandise, to answer questions and to resolve any
problems that may arise. In order to make checking out convenient, check-out
lines are continually monitored and additional cashiers are added as necessary
in order to minimize waiting time. Returning merchandise is simplified through a
return policy that permits customers to return most items without presenting a
sales receipt. Most Bed Bath & Beyond stores are open seven days (and six
evenings) a week in order to enable customers to shop at times that are
convenient for them.

           The Company launched its website, www.bedbathandbeyond.com, in 1999.
The website offers a broad range of online services and features, including
online shopping and gift registry. The Company believes that its E-Service
efforts have been well received by its customers.

           ADVERTISING

           In general, the Company relies on "word of mouth advertising" and on
its reputation for offering a wide assortment of quality merchandise at everyday
low prices, supplemented by the use of paid advertising. The Company uses
full-color circulars and mailing pieces as its primary vehicles of paid
advertising. Also, to support the opening of new stores, the Company uses "grand
opening" full-color circulars and newspaper advertising. The Company believes
that its ability to rely primarily on "word of mouth advertising" will continue
and that its limited use of paid advertising permits it to spend less on
advertising than a number of its competitors.

           EXPANSION

           The Company is engaged in an ongoing expansion program involving the
opening of new stores in both existing and new markets and the expansion or
replacement of existing stores with larger stores. As a result of this program,
the total number of stores has increased from 34 at the beginning of fiscal 1992
to 311 at the end of fiscal 2000, and the total square footage of store space
has increased from approximately 917,000 square feet at the beginning of fiscal
1992 to approximately 12,204,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2000. During
2000, the Company opened 70 new superstores and expanded two stores, which
resulted in the addition of approximately 2,389,000 square feet of store space.

expansion program for the periods indicated:

     (1)   A replaced store is an existing store that was either expanded or
           replaced by a new store in the same area.

     (2)   Excludes any new store that replaced an existing store in the same
           area.


           The Company intends to continue its expansion program and believes
that the continued growth of the Company is dependent, in large part, on the
success of this program. As part of its expansion program, the Company expects
to open new superstores and, in addition, expects to expand existing stores as
opportunities arise.

           The Company expects to open new superstores in existing markets and
new markets. In determining where to open new superstores, the Company evaluates
a number of factors, including the availability of prime real estate and
demographic information (such as data relating to income and education levels,
age and occupation). The

                                       6
<PAGE>   7
Company believes that because it does not use central distribution centers, and
since it relies on paid advertising to only a limited extent, it has the
flexibility to enter a new market with only one or two stores. The Company will
consider opening additional stores in that market, once the stores have been
proven successful.

           From the end of fiscal 2000 through May 1, 2001, the Company has
opened five stores which are located in: Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania; El Paso,
Texas; North Richmond, Virginia; Pentagon Row, Virginia; and Bellevue,
Washington. During the balance of 2001, the Company currently anticipates that
it will open at least 75 additional stores.

           The Company has built its management structure with a view towards
its expansion and believes that as a result the Company has the management depth
necessary to support its anticipated expansion program. Each of the Company's
area managers typically supervise up to three stores. Each of the Company's
district managers typically supervise four to ten stores.

STORE OPERATIONS

           MERCHANDISING

           The Company maintains its own central buying group, comprising of
two Vice President - General Merchandising Managers, as well as a large staff
of divisional merchandise managers, buyers and assistant buyers. Merchandising
of activities are overseen by the Senior Vice President - Chief Merchandising
Officer. The merchandise mix for each store is initially selected by the
central buying group, in consultation with store managers and other local store
personnel. The central buying group is generally responsible for selecting the
merchandise, for ordering the initial inventory required upon the opening of
each store, for ordering the first shipment of any new product line that may be
subsequently added to a store's merchandise mix and for ordering seasonal
merchandise.

           After a store is opened, local store personnel are primarily
responsible for monitoring inventory levels and reordering merchandise as
required. In addition, local store personnel are encouraged to monitor local
sales trends and market conditions and tailor the merchandise mix as appropriate
to respond to changing trends and conditions. The Company believes that its
policy of having the reordering performed at the local store level, rather than
centrally, and having local store personnel determine the appropriate quantity
to reorder encourages entrepreneurship at the store level and better ensures
that in-stock availability will be maintained in accordance with the specific
requirements of each store. The factors taken into account in selecting the
merchandise mix for a particular store include store size and configuration and
local market conditions such as climate and demographics.

           The Company purchases its merchandise from more than 2,800
suppliers. In 2000, the Company's largest supplier accounted for approximately
7% of the Company's merchandise purchases and the Company's 10 largest
suppliers accounted for approximately 28% of such purchases. The Company
purchases substantially all of its merchandise in the United States, the
majority from domestic manufacturers and the balance from importers. The
Company purchases a small amount of its merchandise directly from overseas
sources. The Company has no long-term contracts for the purchase of
merchandise. The Company believes that most merchandise, other than brand name
goods, is available from a variety of sources and that most brand name goods
can be replaced with comparable merchandise.

           WAREHOUSING

           Merchandise is shipped to each store from the Company's vendors,
making it unnecessary for the Company to maintain any central distribution
centers. As a result of the floor to ceiling displays used by the Company, a

                                       7
<PAGE>   8
substantial amount of merchandise is displayed on the sales floor of each store
at all times. Additional merchandise not displayed on the sales floor is stored
in separate warehouse space that is included in each store (with an estimated
10% to 15% of the space of each store being dedicated to warehouse and receiving
space). In the case of a few stores, merchandise is also stored at nearby
supplemental storage space leased by the Company. At present, the warehouse
space included in the Company's stores provides approximately 88% of the
Company's warehouse space requirements and such nearby supplemental storage
space provides the balance.

           MANAGEMENT

           The Company seeks to encourage responsiveness and entrepreneurship at
the store level by providing its managers with a relatively high degree of
autonomy relating to operations and merchandising. This is reflected in the
Company's policy of having reordering conducted at the store level, as well as
in the Company's policy of encouraging managers to tailor the merchandise mix of
each store in response to local sales trends and market conditions.

           In general, stores are staffed with two assistant managers, one
operating manager, and three to six department managers who report to a store
manager, who in turn is supervised by an area or district manager. Area and
district managers report to one of several regional managers or directly to one
of five regional Vice Presidents of Stores, who in turn report to the Senior
Vice President of Stores. Decisions relating to pricing and advertising for all
stores are made centrally in the Company's Buying Office, and certain store
support functions (such as finance and information technology) are performed
centrally in the Company's Corporate Office.

           TRAINING

           The Company places great emphasis on the training of store level
management. All entry management personnel are generally required to work in
different departments of the store in order to acquire an overall understanding
of store operations. In addition, all associates receive formalized training,
including sales techniques and product knowledge, through the Bed Bath & Beyond
University program.

           The Company's policy is to generally build its management
organization from within. Each of the Company's area, district and regional
managers was recruited from the ranks of the Company's store managers and each
of the Company's store managers joined the Company in an entry level position.
The Company believes that its policy of promoting from within, as well as the
opportunities for advancement generated by its ongoing expansion program, serve
as an incentive to persons to seek and retain employment with the Company and
results in low turnover among its managers.

EMPLOYEES

           As of March 3, 2001, the Company employed approximately 15,000
persons, of whom approximately 9,500 were full-time employees and approximately
5,500 were part-time employees. None of the Company's employees are covered by
collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes that its relations with
its employees are excellent and that the labor turnover rate among its
management employees is lower than that experienced in the industry.

SEASONALITY

           The Company's business exhibits less seasonality than many other
retail businesses, although sales levels are generally higher in August,
November and December, and generally lower in February and March.

COMPETITION

           The market for domestics merchandise and home furnishings is
fragmented and highly competitive. While the Company believes it is the
preeminent marketer in the superstore segment of the home goods industry, it
competes directly with a small number of chains of superstores selling domestics
merchandise and home furnishings. In addition, the Company competes with many
different types of retail stores that sell many or most of the products sold by
the Company. Such competitors include: (i) better department stores, which often
carry many of the same product lines as the Company but do not typically have
the same depth or breadth of product selection, (ii) specialty stores (such as
specialty linens or housewares retailers), which often have a depth of product
selection but typically carry only a limited portion of the product lines
carried by the Company, and (iii) discount and mass merchandise stores. In
addition, the Company competes to a more limited extent with factory outlet
stores that typically offer limited quantities or limited lines of better
quality merchandise at discount prices.

           The Company believes that it is the largest operator of superstores
selling predominantly better quality domestics merchandise and home furnishings
typically found in better department stores, and that it is well positioned to
compete successfully in its markets as measured by several factors, including
pricing, breadth and quality of product selection, in-stock availability of
merchandise, effective merchandise presentation, customer service and store
locations.

           The visibility of the Company has encouraged superstore competitors
to imitate the Company's format and methods. Other retail chains continue to
introduce new store concepts which include many of the product lines carried by
the Company. There can be no assurance that the operation of competitors,
including those companies operating stores similar to those of Bed Bath &
Beyond, will not have a material effect on the Company.

TRADE NAMES AND SERVICE MARKS

           The Company uses its nationally recognized "Bed Bath & Beyond" name
and logo and its "Beyond any store of its kind" tag line as service marks in
connection with retail services. The Company has registered these marks and
others with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company also has
registered or has applications pending with the trademark registries of several
foreign countries. Management believes that its nationally recognized name and
its service marks are an important element of the Company's merchandising
strategy.

           The Company currently leases all of its existing stores. The leases
provide for original lease terms that generally range from five to fifteen years
and certain leases provide for renewal options that range from five to fifteen
years, often at increased rents. Certain leases provide for scheduled rent
increases (which, in the case of fixed increases, the Company accounts for on a
straight line basis over the noncancelable lease term) and/or for contingent
rent (based upon store sales exceeding stipulated amounts).

           The Company also leases merchandise storage space in nine locations
amounting to approximately 208,000 square feet. This space is used to supplement
the warehouse facilities in the Company's stores in proximity to these
locations. One of these locations also provides fulfillment for the Company's
E-service activities. See Item 1 "Business--Store Operations--Warehousing."

           The Company's Corporate Office is located in 131,000 square feet of
office space in Union, New Jersey,

of any future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in light of
conditions then existing, including the Company's earnings, financial condition
and requirements, restrictions in financing agreements, business conditions and

under its Credit Agreement. See Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary

                    Independent Auditor's Report on Schedule

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.:

Under the date of March 30, 2001, we reported on the consolidated balance
sheets of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 3, 2001 and
February 26, 2000, and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the
three-year period ended March 3, 2001, as contained in the Company's Annual
Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 3, 2001.  These
consolidated financial statements and our report thereon are incorporated by
reference in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 3,
2001. In connection with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited the related financial statement schedule listed
in Part IV, Item 14(a)(2) of this Form 10-K.  This financial statement schedule
is the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on this financial statement schedule based on our audits.

In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
