Item 1. Business.

GENERAL

     Ambac Financial Group, Inc., headquartered in New York City, is a holding
company whose subsidiaries provide financial guarantee products and other
financial services to clients in both the public and private sectors around the
world. Ambac Financial Group was incorporated on April 29, 1991. Ambac Financial
Group provides financial guarantees for public finance and structured finance
obligations through its principal operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance
Corporation. Through its financial services subsidiaries, Ambac Financial Group
provides financial and investment products including investment agreements,
interest rate and total return swaps, funding conduits, investment advisory and
cash management services, principally to its financial guarantee clients which
include municipalities and their authorities, school districts, health care
organizations and asset-backed issuers.

     Ambac Assurance, which serves the global capital markets, is primarily
engaged in guaranteeing public finance and structured finance obligations and is
the successor to the founding financial guarantee insurance company, which wrote
the first bond insurance policy in 1971. Financial guarantee insurance policies
written by Ambac Assurance in both the primary and secondary markets generally
guarantee payment when due of the principal of and interest on the guaranteed
obligation. Ambac Assurance seeks to minimize the risk inherent in its financial
guarantee portfolio by maintaining a diverse portfolio which spreads its risk
across a number of criteria, including issue size, type of bond, geographic area
and obligor. As of December 31, 2001, Ambac Assurance's net financial guarantee
in force (after giving effect for reinsurance) was $476.2 billion. See
"Financial Guarantee in Force" below.

     Ambac Credit Products LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ambac Assurance,
provides credit protection in the global markets in the form of structured
credit derivatives. These structured credit derivatives involve private
transactions in which highly rated credit risk is assumed by Ambac Credit
Products. These contracts require Ambac Credit Products to make payments upon
the occurrence of certain defined credit events relating to an underlying
obligation or portfolio of obligations (generally a fixed income obligation).
Structured credit derivatives issued by Ambac Credit Products are insured by
Ambac Assurance. See "Business Segments -- Financial Guarantee" below and
"Management's Discussion and Analysis -- Risk Management" in Ambac Financial
Group's 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders for more detail about structured
credit derivatives.

     Ambac Assurance has earned triple-A ratings, the highest ratings available
from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), Standard & Poor's Ratings
Services ("S&P"), Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch") and Rating and Investment Information,
Inc. ("R&I"). These ratings are an essential part of Ambac Assurance's ability
to provide credit enhancement. See "Rating Agencies" below.

     Ambac Financial Group's investment agreement business, conducted through
its subsidiary, Ambac Capital Funding, Inc., provides investment agreements
primarily to municipalities and their authorities, structured finance
obligations and international issuers. Investment agreements issued by Ambac
Capital Funding are insured by Ambac Assurance. Investment agreements are
primarily used by issuers to invest bond proceeds until the proceeds can be used
for their intended purpose. The investment agreement provides for the guaranteed
return of principal invested, and for the payment of interest thereon at a
guaranteed rate. See "Investment Agreements" below.

                                        1

<PAGE>

     Ambac Financial Group provides interest rate and total return swaps through
its subsidiary Ambac Financial Services, L.P., primarily to states,
municipalities and their authorities, issuers of asset-backed securities and
other entities in connection with their financings. Ambac Financial Services
also enters into total return swaps with professional counterparties. Total
return swaps are only used for fixed income obligations, which meet Ambac
Assurance's credit underwriting criteria. See "Derivative Products" below.

     Ambac Financial Group provides investment advisory, cash management and
fund administration services through its subsidiary, Cadre Financial Services,
Inc., and broker/dealer services through its subsidiary, Cadre Securities, Inc.,
primarily to school districts, hospitals and health care organizations, and
municipalities.

     As a holding company, Ambac Financial Group, Inc. is largely dependent on
dividends from Ambac Assurance, its principal operating subsidiary, to pay
dividends on its capital stock, to pay principal and interest on its
indebtedness, to pay its operating expenses, to purchase its common stock in the
open market and to make capital investments in its subsidiaries. Dividends from
Ambac Assurance are subject to certain insurance regulatory restrictions. See
"Insurance Regulatory Matters -- Wisconsin Dividend Restrictions" below and
"Management's Discussion and Analysis -- Liquidity and Capital Resources" in
Ambac Financial Group's 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders.

     Materials in this Form 10-K may contain information that includes or is
based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give Ambac Financial
Group's expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these
statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current
facts and relate to future operating or financial performance.

     Any or all of our forward-looking statements here or in other publications
may turn out to be wrong and are based on current expectations and the current
economic environment. Ambac Financial Group's actual results may vary
materially, and there are no guarantees about the performance of Ambac Financial
Group's securities. Among factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially are: (1) changes in the economic, credit or interest rate environment
in the United States and abroad; (2) the level of activity within the national
and worldwide debt markets; (3) competitive conditions and pricing levels; (4)
legislative and regulatory developments; (5) changes in tax laws; (6) the
policies and actions of the United States and other governments and (7) other
risks and uncertainties that have not been identified at this time. Ambac
Financial Group is not obligated to publicly correct or update any
forward-looking statement if we later become aware that it is not likely to be
achieved, except as required by law. You are advised, however, to consult any
further disclosures we make on related subjects in Ambac Financial Group's
reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

     The following paragraphs describe the business operations of Ambac
Financial Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries for it's two reportable segments:
Financial Guarantee and Financial Services.

     Financial Guarantee

     Generally, financial guarantee insurance written by Ambac Assurance
guarantees to the holder of the underlying obligation timely payment of
principal and interest by the issuer on such obligation in accordance with its
original payment schedule.

     Financial guarantee insurance is a form of credit enhancement that benefits
both the issuer and the investor. Issuers benefit because their securities are
sold with a higher credit rating than securities of the issuer sold without
credit enhancement, resulting in interest cost savings and greater
marketability. In addition, for complex financings and obligations of issuers
that are not well known by investors, credit enhanced obligations receive
greater market acceptance than obligations without credit enhancement. Investors
benefit from greater marketability, secondary market price stability, active
credit surveillance and protection from loss associated with issuer default.

     Structured credit derivatives written by Ambac Credit Products provide
credit protection in respect of specific financial obligations (primarily fixed
income obligations). Ambac Credit Product's structured credit derivative
contracts relate to highly rated risks, investment grade risks, and in some
cases are partially hedged with various financial institutions or structured
with first loss protection. Such structuring mitigates Ambac Credit Product's
risk of loss and reduces the price volatility of these financial instruments.
Should a defined credit event occur, Ambac Credit Products would generally make
a payment equivalent to the difference between the par value and market value of
the underlying obligation.

     Ambac Financial Group derives financial guarantee revenues from: (i)
premiums earned over the life of the obligations guaranteed; (ii) net investment
income; (iii) revenue from credit derivative transactions; (iv) net realized
gains and losses from sales of investment securities; and (v) certain
structuring and other fees. Financial guarantee revenues were $672.0 million,
$565.4 million and $474.1 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Ambac
Financial Group's 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders.

     Financial guarantee products are sold in three principal markets: the U.S.
public finance market, the U.S. structured finance and asset-backed market, and
the international market. Total gross par guaranteed for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $90.1 billion, $77.0 billion and $77.2
billion, respectively.

     U. S. Public Finance Market

     The U.S. public finance market includes taxable and tax-exempt bonds, notes
and other evidences of indebtedness issued by states, political subdivisions
(e.g., cities, counties, towns and villages), water, sewer, electric and other
utility districts, airports, higher educational institutions, hospitals,
transportation and housing authorities and other similar authorities and
agencies. Public finance obligations are generally supported by either the
taxing authority of the

                                        3

<PAGE>

issuer or the issuer's or underlying obligor's ability to collect fees or
assessments for certain projects or public services. More recently, the public
finance market has expanded to include structured, project finance and
asset-backed bond issues for infrastructure projects, sports stadiums, lease
pools and other municipal purposes. This portion of the market is growing and
has become a focus for Ambac Financial Group in recent years. The following
table sets forth the volume of new issues of long-term (longer than 12 months)
public finance bonds and the volume of new issues of insured long-term public
finance bonds over the past ten years in the United States.

</TABLE>

Source: Amounts, except for 2001, are based upon estimated data reported by The
        Bond Buyer's 2001 Yearbook. The 2001 amounts are Ambac Assurance
        estimates, compiled from industry sources including Securities Data
        Company, Inc. and The Bond Buyer. Amounts represent gross par amounts
        issued or insured, respectively, during such year.

     The foregoing table illustrates the changes in the total volume and insured
volume of new issues of public finance bonds over the past ten years. Changes in
volume of public finance bond issuance during this period are primarily
attributable to changes in refunding activity related to the then-current
interest rate environment, along with the issuers new money requirements.
Insured volume, as a percentage of total volume, which had grown consistently
from 1992 through 1998, declined during 1999 and 2000. The decline during 2000
is generally considered to have resulted from the combination of the relatively
high credit quality of issues that came to market during the period and the
firmness in premium pricing in the industry. During 2001, this market has shown
a resurgence, largely the result of the lower interest rate environment causing
an increase in both the refinancing and new money components of the market.
Also, the percentage of insured bonds increased, partially due to general credit
concerns.

     Ambac Assurance guaranteed gross par of $35.9 billion, $21.4 billion and
$32.5 billion in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, in the U.S. public finance
market.

     In the U.S. public finance market, an issuer typically pays an up-front
premium to Ambac Assurance at the time the policy is issued. Premiums are
usually quoted as a percentage of the total amount of principal and interest
that is scheduled to become due during the life of the insured bonds.

     Proposed new public finance bond issues are submitted to Ambac Assurance by
issuers (or their investment bankers or financial advisors) to determine their
suitability for financial guarantee. Public finance bond issues are sold on
either a competitive or a negotiated basis. With respect to competitive issues,
an issuer will publish a notice of sale soliciting bids for the purchase of a
proposed issue of bonds. Potential bidders on the bonds then form syndicates.
These syndicates then solicit a determination from some or all of the financial
guarantors whether an issue is suitable for financial guarantee and at what
premium rate and on what

                                        4

<PAGE>

terms. The syndicate then determines whether to bid on the issue with a
financial guarantee (and if so, with which financial guarantor) or without a
financial guarantee. The issuer then generally selects the syndicate with the
lowest bid. In a negotiated offering, the issuer has already selected an
investment bank and that investment bank solicits premium quotes and terms from
the financial guarantors.

     Ambac Assurance also provides financial guarantees on public finance bonds
outstanding in the secondary market that are typically purchased by an
institution to facilitate the sale of bonds in its portfolio or inventory. The
financial guarantee generally increases the sale price of bonds (typically by an
amount greater than the cost of the policy) and affords a wider secondary market
and therefore greater marketability to a given issue of previously issued bonds.
As is the case with new issues, the premium is generally payable in full at the
time of policy issuance. Ambac Assurance employs the same underwriting standards
on secondary market issues that it does on new public finance issues.

     As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, net outstanding par exposure related to
public finance bond transactions was $196.6 billion and $180.3 billion,
respectively. See "Financial Guarantees in Force - Types of Bonds" below, for a
breakout of net outstanding par exposure by bond type.

     U.S. Structured Finance and Asset-backed Market

     Financial guarantees of securities in the U.S. structured finance and
asset-backed market are typically issued in connection with transactions in
which the securities being issued are secured by or payable from a specific pool
of financial or tangible assets. This pool of assets has an identifiable cash
flow or market value and is generally held by a special purpose issuing entity.

     Asset-backed securizations may be supported by a broad range of financial
assets including mortgage loans and home equity loans, credit card receivables,
trade receivables, auto loans, student loans and leases. Collateralized debt
obligations, a type of structured finance transaction, are typically backed by
corporate, sovereign or sub-sovereign debt. Equipment enhanced trust
certificates are secured by specific tangible assets (e.g. aircraft) and the
cash flow generated thereby, typically rental income and the liquidation value
of the assets.

     Structured finance also encompasses credit enhancement for asset-backed
commercial paper conduits ("conduits"). Conduits are used by issuers to
efficiently fund assets in the short-term commercial paper market. Typically
sponsored by financial institutions, the conduits typically purchase financial
assets and asset-backed securities, and issue commercial paper to fund the
purchase of the assets. In addition to providing credit enhancement to the
conduit with respect to all assets owned by the conduit, Ambac Assurance may
also provide a financial guarantee against the default of a specific financial
asset sold into a conduit.

     Structured finance and asset-backed obligations insured by Ambac Assurance
generally have the benefit of over-collateralization and/or other forms of
credit enhancement to mitigate credit risks associated with the related assets.

     Unlike the public finance market in which a substantial portion of the
deals is bid competitively by the financial guarantors, the structured and
asset-backed market is essentially a negotiated one. The financial guarantor
will work directly with the investment bank or client to create an acceptable
structure. Consequently, in addition to the types of deals listed above,
structured finance will also include unique transactions and small market
niches.

                                        5

<PAGE>

     The U.S. structured finance and asset-backed market in which Ambac
Assurance provides financial guarantees is broad and varied, comprising public
issues, private placements and asset-backed commercial paper. The increasing
array of classes of assets securitized or guaranteed, and the recent rapid
development of the market, makes estimating the size of the aggregate U.S.
structured finance and asset-backed markets difficult. Three of the most
developed sectors of this market are public asset-backed, mortgage-backed
securities and asset-backed commercial paper. According to Asset-Backed Alert,
volume in U.S. public asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities combined
totaled $471.3 billion and $341.3 billion in 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Approximately 19% and 21% of those markets were insured in 2001 and 2000,
respectively. According to the Federal Reserve, total asset-backed commercial
paper outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately $745.3 billion
and $641.8 billion, respectively.

     Ambac Assurance insured gross par of $33.0 billion, $30.7 billion and $33.5
billion in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, in the U.S. Structured Finance and
Asset-backed market.

     Premiums for structured finance and asset-backed policies are typically
based on a percentage of principal insured. Generally, the timing of the
collection of structured finance and asset-backed premiums are collected in a
single payment at policy inception date, and others being collected periodically
(e.g., monthly, quarterly or annually) from the cash flow generated by the
underlying assets.

     As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, net outstanding par exposure related to
U.S. structured finance and asset-backed transactions was $72.6 billion and
$64.7 billion, respectively. See "Financial Guarantees in Force - Types of
Bonds" below, for a breakout of net outstanding par exposure by bond type.

     International Finance Market

     Outside of the United States, structured and asset-backed issuers,
utilities, sovereign and sub-sovereign issuers, and other issuers are
increasingly using financial guarantee products, particularly in markets
throughout Western Europe. A number of important trends in international finance
markets have contributed to this expansion. In the United Kingdom, Australia and
elsewhere, ongoing privatization efforts have shifted certain risks associated
with the development or impairment of infrastructure projects from the
government to market participants, thus prompting investors in such projects to
seek the security of financial guarantee products. In Europe, Australia, Japan
and the Emerging Markets, there is growing interest in asset-backed
securitization.

     While the principles of securitization have been increasingly applied in
overseas markets, development in particular countries has varied due to the
sophistication of the local capital markets and the impact of legal and
financial regulatory requirements and accounting standards. It is anticipated
that securitization will continue to expand internationally, albeit at varying
rates in each country. Ambac Assurance insures a wide array of obligations in
the international finance markets including infrastructure finance, asset-backed
and structured finance transactions, utilities, and other obligations in
selected international finance markets.

     Ambac Assurance's strategy in the international finance markets is to
strengthen its franchise in developed markets by focusing on high quality
infrastructure, structured finance, securitization, and utility finance
transactions, and in emerging markets by focusing on top tier

                                        6

<PAGE>

future flow transactions (structured transactions secured by cash flows
generated from exports or payment remittances) and collateralized debt
obligations.

     Since 1997, Ambac Assurance UK Limited, which is authorized to conduct
certain classes of general financial guarantee business in the United Kingdom,
has been Ambac Assurance's primary vehicle for directly issuing financial
guarantee policies in the United Kingdom and Europe. Ambac UK has entered into
net worth maintenance and reinsurance agreements with Ambac Assurance, which
support its triple-A ratings.

     During 2000, Ambac Assurance entered into an alliance agreement in Japan
with Yasuda Fire and Marine and now occupies joint offices in Japan with Yasuda
Kasai Financial Guarantee Insurance Company, Limited ("YKFG"), a Yasuda Fire and
Marine subsidiary and the first triple-A rated monoline financial guarantor in
Japan. Together, Ambac Assurance and YKFG will seek to significantly increase
the market for financial guarantees in Japan.

     From 1995 to March 2000, Ambac Assurance and MBIA Insurance Corporation
("MBIA") marketed financial guarantees outside of the United States via an
unincorporated joint venture, MBIA.AMBAC International (the "Joint Venture").
The companies now market and originate financial guarantees independently.

     While there is evidence that the volume of international structured finance
transactions has increased significantly in the recent past, unlike the public
finance and domestic asset-backed markets, there are few statistics that
effectively track volume in the global markets. There are several reasons for
this, including the varied nature of the deals coming to market, the early
stages of development of certain asset classes and the fact that many
international deals are privately placed.

     Ambac Assurance guaranteed gross par of $21.2 billion, $24.9 billion and
$11.2 billion in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, in the international finance
market. Premiums for international finance policies are based on a percentage of
either principal or principal and interest insured. The timing of the collection
of international finance premiums varies among individual transactions; some
being collected in a single payment at policy inception date, and others being
collected periodically (i.e., monthly, quarterly or annually).

     As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, net outstanding par exposure related to
international finance transactions was $48.8 billion and $31.3 billion,
respectively. See "Financial Guarantees in Force - Types of Bonds" below, for a
breakout of net outstanding par exposure by bond type.

Underwriting and Surveillance

     Underwriting guidelines, policies and procedures have been developed by
Ambac Assurance's management with the intent that Ambac Assurance guarantee only
those obligations which, in the opinion of Ambac Assurance analysts, are of
investment grade quality with a remote risk of loss. However, losses may occur
from time to time and it is Ambac Assurance's policy to provide for loss
reserves that are adequate to cover potential losses. See "Losses and Reserves"
below.

     The underwriting process involves review of structural, legal, political
and credit issues, including compliance with current Ambac Assurance
underwriting standards. These standards are reviewed periodically by management.
Additionally, the underwriting process often entails extensive on-site due
diligence covering the issuer and other parties to an insured transaction.

                                        7

<PAGE>

     The decision to guarantee an issue is based upon such factors as the
issuer's ability to repay the bonds, the bond's security features and the bond's
structure, rather than upon an actuarial or statistical prediction of the
likelihood that the issuer will default on the underlying debt obligation.

     Members of Ambac Assurance's underwriting staff review all requests for
guarantees. The underwriting process is designed to screen issues and begins
with a credit analysis by the primary analyst assigned to the issue. The credit
is then reviewed within the primary analyst's underwriting group. At a minimum,
the primary analyst's recommendation to qualify or reject an issue must be
approved by a concurring analyst and an underwriting officer. The number of
additional approvals required for a particular credit depends on Ambac
Assurance's aggregate exposure to the credit. In some cases, the complexity of
the credit or whether it is a new asset type are determining factors in the
approval/review process. For large, complex or new types of credits, the
underwriting decision must be approved by a credit committee comprised of senior
underwriting officers and an attorney, in addition to the analysts and
underwriting officer mentioned above.

     Ambac Assurance assigns internal ratings to individual exposures as part of
the underwriting process and at surveillance reviews. These internal ratings,
which represent Ambac Assurance's independent judgments, are based upon
underlying credit parameters similar to those used by rating agencies.

     Public Finance Underwriting:
     ---------------------------
     In addition to general underwriting standards, each asset class, and bond
type within asset class, has more specific underwriting criteria. For example,
the critical risk factors for public finance credits will include the credit
quality of the issuer, type of issue, the repayment source, the type of security
pledged, the presence of restrictive covenants, and the bond's maturity. Each
bond issue is evaluated in accordance with, and the final premium rate is a
function of, the particular factors as they relate to such issue.

     Underwriting criteria that have been developed for each bond type reflect
the differences in, for example, economic and social factors, debt management,
project essentiality, financial management, legal and administrative factors,
revenue sources and security features.

     Structured Finance Underwriting:
     -------------------------------
     Structured finance and asset-backed obligations generally entail two forms
of risks: asset risk, which relates to the amount and quality of asset coverage;
and structural risk, which relates to the extent to which the transaction
structure protects the interests of the investors, and therefore the guarantor.

     In general, the amount and quality of asset coverage required is determined
by the historical performance of the assets. The future performance or value of
the underlying pool of assets will generally determine whether the amount of
over-collateralization or other credit enhancement ultimately is sufficient to
protect investors, and therefore the guarantor, against adverse asset
performance. The ability of the servicer or manager to properly service and/or
manage the underlying assets often is a factor in determining future asset
performance.

     Structured and asset-backed securities are usually designed to protect the
investors, and therefore the guarantor, from the bankruptcy or insolvency of the
entity that originated the underlying assets as well as from the bankruptcy or
insolvency of the servicer of those assets. The servicer of the assets is
typically responsible for collecting cash payments on the underlying assets and
forwarding such payments, net of servicing fees, to the special purpose

                                        8

<PAGE>

issuing entity. Related issues that often arise concern whether the sale of the
assets by the originator to the issuer of the asset-backed obligations would be
respected in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the originator and
whether the servicer of the assets may be permitted or required to delay the
remittance to investors of any cash collections held by it or received by it
after the time it becomes subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. In
addition, servicer risk is often present in these transactions. Generally,
servicer risk is the risk that poor performance at the servicer level
contributes to a decline in the collections of borrower payments in the
transaction. Ambac Assurance addresses these risks through its credit
underwriting guidelines, standards and procedures.

     Within the mortgage-backed and home equity loan market, Ambac Assurance
seeks to work with higher quality, well-capitalized issuers. The issuers
typically originate or purchase first lien mortgages, home equity loans or home
equity lines of credit, which are in turn sold by the issuers in the form of
asset-backed securities. In considering whether to guarantee these securities,
Ambac Assurance analyzes the quality of the underlying assets, the structure of
the securitization, the experience and financial strength of the servicer of the
underlying assets and the credit quality of the issuer.

     International Finance Underwriting:
     ----------------------------------
     In the international markets, Ambac Assurance seeks to guarantee
transactions of the same high credit standards it applies in its U.S. business.
However, an understanding of the unique risks related to the particular country
and region that could impact the credit of the issuer is necessary. These risks
include legal and political environments, capital market dynamics, exposures to
foreign exchange, and the degree of governmental support. Ambac Assurance
monitors these risks carefully and addresses them through its credit
underwriting guidelines, country limits, standards and procedures.

     Geographically, the markets receiving Ambac Assurance's primary
international focus have been the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, France,
Germany and certain parts of Latin America. In addition, Ambac has guaranteed
transactions in which the geographic risk is spread over multiple countries. The
types of international obligations guaranteed have primarily been pooled
corporate obligations, asset-backed securities, sovereign and sub-sovereign
obligations, special revenue and infrastructure obligations. Management believes
that risk associated with its international book of business is similar in risk
type to its domestic structured finance book of business and, in fact,
international transactions may include components of domestic exposure.

     Pricing:
     -------
     Ambac Assurance determines premium rates on the basis of the bond type and
its perception of the risk it is assuming based on the credit strength of the
bond issue. Factors considered in pricing include term to maturity, structure of
the issue, and credit and market factors including security features and other
credit enhancement features. Additionally, the interest rate spread between
insured and uninsured obligations with characteristics similar to those of the
proposed bond issue is considered in the pricing process as well as the cost and
the projected return to Ambac Assurance. The premium rate for a new issue also
takes into account the benefits to be obtained by the issuer.

     Surveillance and Remediation:
     ----------------------------
     Surveillance groups and other credit professionals review the financial
guarantee portfolio for concentration of risk by (i) specific bond types; (ii)
geographic location; and (iii) size of issue. Surveillance analysts schedule and
execute regular and ad hoc reviews of credits in the book of business.
Risk-adjusted surveillance strategies have been developed for each bond type.
Review periods and scope of review vary by bond type based upon the risk
inherent in the nature of the credits. The focus of the surveillance review is
to determine credit trends and recommend

                                        9

<PAGE>

appropriate classification and review periods. The separate underwriting groups
are also responsible for portfolio surveillance which entails a broader
examination of trends in specific asset classes and bond types.

     Surveillance of the credit quality of underlying reference obligations in
the Ambac Financial Group's structured credit derivatives portfolio is performed
on a regular basis. Credit spreads, which act as a measure of the market's
perception of an issuer's credit quality, are monitored to identify potential
problems. In addition, published credit ratings and current news reports are
monitored regularly.

     Those issues that are either in default or have developed problems that
eventually may lead to a claim or loss are tracked closely by the appropriate
surveillance team. Internal and/or outside counsel reviews the documents
underlying any problem credit and an analysis is prepared outlining Ambac
Assurance's rights and potential remedies, the duties of all parties involved
and recommendations for corrective actions. This analysis, along with the
schedule of corrective actions, is reviewed in the regular remedial credit
meetings. Ambac Assurance also meets with issuers to reach agreement upon the
nature and the scope of the problem and to discuss the issuers' operating plans.

     In many instances, Ambac Assurance, under the terms of the documents
governing the underlying obligation, has the ability, among other things, to
direct that audits be performed with respect to servicer and trustee contractual
responsibilities. Ambac Assurance would meet with the appropriate officials to
outline Ambac Assurance's concerns and rights. When the underlying economics so
indicate, Ambac Assurance may aid in a restructuring to improve the debt service
coverage.

     The rating agencies also monitor the credits underlying Ambac Assurance's
financial guarantee in force and, in most cases, advise Ambac Assurance of the
credit rating each issue would receive if it were not insured.

     Portfolio Risk Management Committee:
     -----------------------------------
     Ambac Financial Group has a Portfolio Risk Management Committee ("PRMC")
which has established various procedures and controls to monitor and manage
credit risk. The Portfolio Risk Management Committee is comprised of senior
credit professionals and senior management of Ambac Financial Group. Its purview
is enterprise-wide and its focus is on risk limits and measurement,
concentration and correlation of risk, and the attribution of economic and
regulatory capital in a portfolio context. This committee works closely with the
senior credit committees of each underwriting group to assure that credit
criteria are maintained, are appropriate and are systematically and consistently
applied.

Financial Guarantees in Force

     Ambac Assurance underwrites and prices financial guarantees on the
assumption that the guarantee will remain in force until maturity of the
underlying bonds. Ambac Assurance estimates that the average life of its
guarantees on par in force at December 31, 2001 was 11 years. The 11 year
average life is determined by applying a weighted average calculation, using the
remaining years to maturity of each guaranteed bond, and weighting them on the
basis of the remaining par guaranteed. No assumptions are made for prepayments
or future refundings of guaranteed issues.

                                       10

<PAGE>

     Ambac Assurance seeks to maintain a diversified financial guarantee
portfolio designed to spread its risk based on a variety of criteria, including
issue size, type of bond, geographic area and issuer.

     As of December 31, 2001, the total net par amount of guaranteed bonds
outstanding was $318.0 billion.

     Issue Size

     Ambac Assurance seeks a broad coverage of the market by guaranteeing small
and large issues alike. Ambac Assurance's financial guarantee exposure as of
December 31, 2001 reflects the historical emphasis on issues guaranteed with an
original par amount of less than $25 million in the public finance market.
However, U.S. structured finance and international finance transactions have an
emphasis on larger deals. The following table sets forth the distribution of
Ambac Assurance's guaranteed portfolio as of December 31, 2001, with respect to

         Single Risk

         Ambac Assurance has adopted underwriting and exposure management
policies designed to limit the net guarantees in force for any one credit. In
addition, Ambac Assurance uses reinsurance to limit net exposure to any one
credit. As of December 31, 2001, Ambac Assurance's net par amount outstanding
for its 20 largest credits, totaling $13.4 billion, was approximately 4.2% of
Ambac Assurance's total net par amount outstanding with no one credit
representing more than 1% of Ambac Assurance's total net par amount outstanding.
Ambac Assurance is also subject to certain regulatory limits and rating agency
guidelines on exposure to a single credit. See "Insurance Regulatory Matters"
and "Rating Agencies," below.

Losses and Reserves

         Although there have been certain monetary defaults in bond issues of
substantial amounts, the incidence of monetary default on public finance and
structured finance bonds has historically been infrequent. The relatively low
incidence of bond defaults is the result of many factors, including the high
quality of issuers, the essentiality of funding, strong cash flow and legal
structures. Ambac Assurance's loss experience has been excellent historically,
due to its adherence to strict underwriting standards within these already high
quality markets. While this underwriting process has resulted in low loss rates
historically, an increased level of defaults in the future may be caused by
presently unforeseen economic and other factors.

Ambac Assurance's policy is to provide for loss and loss adjustment expense
reserves that are adequate to cover potential unidentified losses inherent in
the portfolio, as well as losses that may arise from guaranteed obligations
which are currently or imminently in monetary default. The active credit reserve
represents an estimate of unidentified losses from our guaranteed obligations.
As of December 31, 2001, Ambac Assurance's active credit reserve was $122.3
million. When a monetary default occurs or is imminent with respect to a
particular guaranteed obligation, a case basis reserve is established in an
amount that is sufficient to cover the present value of the anticipated
defaulted debt service payments over the expected period of default and the
estimated expenses associated with settling the claims, less estimated
recoveries under salvage or subrogation rights. In estimating the losses on
monetary defaults,

                                       14

<PAGE>

Ambac Assurance makes its assessment based on the full term of the guaranteed
obligation. All or part of the case basis reserve may be allocated from the
available active credit reserve. Ambac Assurance's net case basis reserves
totaled $27.8 million at December 31, 2001.

         The most recent three-year history of Ambac Assurance's loss reserves,
and losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred and paid, is detailed in the

</TABLE>

         Management of Ambac Assurance believes that the reserves for losses and
loss adjustment expenses are adequate to cover the ultimate net costs of claims,
but the reserves are necessarily based on estimates and there can be no
assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed such estimates. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" and Note 2 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in Ambac Financial Group's 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders.

Competition

         The financial guarantee business is highly competitive. Ambac
Assurance's principal competitors in the market for financial guarantees are
three other triple-A rated monoline insurance companies, Financial Guaranty
Insurance Company, Financial Security Assurance Inc. and MBIA. In addition,
banks, smaller and lower rated financial guarantee insurance companies,
multiline insurers and reinsurers represent additional participants in the
broader market. The principal competitive factors are: (i) premium rates; (ii)
conditions precedent to the issuance of a policy related to the structure and
security features of a proposed bond issue; (iii) the financial strength of the
guarantor; and (iv) the quality of service provided to issuers, investors and
other clients of the issuer. With respect to each of these competitive factors,
Ambac Assurance believes it is on at least equal footing with each of its
principal competitors.

         Financial guarantee insurance also competes domestically and
internationally with other forms of credit enhancement, including letters of
credit and guarantees (for example, mortgage guarantees where pools of mortgages
secure debt service payments) provided by banks and other financial
institutions, some of which are governmental agencies. Letters of credit are
most often issued for periods of less than 10 years, although there is no legal
restriction on the issuance of letters of credit having longer terms. Thus,
financial institutions and banks issuing letters of credit compete directly with
Ambac Assurance to guarantee short-term notes and bonds with a maturity of less
than 10 years.

         In order to enter the financial guarantee market certain requirements
must be met, most restrictive of which is that a significant minimum amount of
capital is required of a financial guarantor in order to obtain financial
strength ratings by the rating agencies. In addition, under

                                       15

<PAGE>

the New York law, a monoline financial guarantor must have at least $75 million
of paid-in capital and surplus and maintain thereafter at least $65 million of
policyholders' surplus. A similar law in California imposes a $100 million
minimum capital and surplus requirement, with a maintenance requirement
thereafter of $75 million.

Reinsurance

         State insurance laws and regulations (as well as the rating agencies)
impose minimum capital requirements and single risk limits on financial
guarantee insurance companies, limiting the aggregate amount of insurance which
may be written and the maximum size of any single risk exposure which may be
assumed. Such companies can use reinsurance to diversify risk, increase
underwriting capacity, reduce additional capital needs, stabilize shareholder
returns and strengthen financial ratios. See "Insurance Regulatory Matters,"
below.

         Ambac Assurance has facultative and treaty reinsurance agreements with
certain high quality reinsurers that allow Ambac Assurance to reduce its large
risks, to manage its portfolio of insurance by bond type and geographic
distribution, and to provide additional capacity for frequent bond issuers. In
April 2001, Ambac Assurance entered into a new surplus share treaty in order to
secure reinsurance on large domestic and international transactions.
Additionally, Ambac Assurance utilizes facultative reinsurance when needed. A
ceding commission is withheld by Ambac Assurance to defray its underwriting
expenses.

         As of December 31, 2001, Ambac Assurance had retained approximately 88%
of its gross financial guarantees in force of $542.5 billion and had ceded
approximately 12% to its reinsurers. The largest reinsurer accounts for 3% of
gross financial guarantees in force. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in Ambac Financial Group's 2001 Annual Report to
Stockholders.

         As a primary financial guarantor, Ambac Assurance is required to honor
its obligations to its policyholders whether or not its reinsurers perform their
obligations under the various reinsurance agreements with Ambac Assurance. To
minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, Ambac
Assurance evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers, prepares annual
written reviews of such reinsurers and monitors for concentrations of credit
risk. Ambac Assurance's current primary reinsurers are Ace Guaranty Re, American
Re, AXA Re Finance, Enhance Reinsurance Company, Yasuda Kasai Financial
Guarantee, Ram Reinsurance Limited and MBIA.

Rating Agencies

         Moody's, S&P, Fitch and Ratings & Investment periodically review the
business and financial condition of Ambac Assurance and other companies
providing financial guarantees. These rating agencies' reviews focus on the
guarantor's underwriting policies and procedures and the quality of the
obligations guaranteed. The rating agencies have access to all insured
obligations and frequently perform assessments of the credits guaranteed by
Ambac Assurance to confirm that Ambac Assurance continues to meet the capital
allocation criteria considered necessary by the particular rating agency to
maintain Ambac Assurance's triple-A ratings. A rating by Moody's, S&P, Fitch or
Ratings & Investment, however, is not a "market rating" or a recommendation to
buy, hold or sell any security. Ambac Assurance's ability to attract new
business or to compete with other triple-A rated financial guarantors, and its
results of operations and financial condition, would be materially adversely
affected by any reduction in its ratings.

Insurance Regulatory Matters

         General Law

         Ambac Assurance is licensed to do business as an insurance company in
all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the
territory of Guam. Ambac U.K., Ambac Assurance's wholly owned subsidiary, is
licensed to transact insurance in the United Kingdom and to offer insurance
services into twelve other European countries. Ambac Assurance is subject to the
insurance laws and regulations of the State of Wisconsin (the "Wisconsin
Insurance Laws"), its state of incorporation, and the insurance laws and
regulations of other states in which it is licensed to transact business. Ambac
U.K. is subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the United Kingdom.
These laws and regulations, as well as the level of supervisory authority that
may be exercised by the various state insurance departments, vary by
jurisdiction. They generally require financial guarantors to maintain minimum
standards of business conduct and solvency, meet certain financial tests, file
certain reports with regulatory authorities, including information concerning
their capital structure, ownership and financial condition. They generally
require prior approval of certain changes in control of domestic financial
guarantors and their direct and indirect parents and the payment of certain
dividends and distributions. In addition, these laws and regulations require
approval of certain inter-corporate transfers of assets and certain transactions
between financial guarantors and their direct and indirect parents and
affiliates. They generally require that all such transactions have terms no less
favorable than terms that would result from transactions between parties
negotiating at arm's length. Ambac Assurance is required to file quarterly and
annual statutory financial statements in each jurisdiction in which it is
licensed. It is subject to single and aggregate risk limits and other statutory
restrictions concerning the types and quality of investments and the filing and
use of policy forms and premium rates. Additionally, Ambac Assurance's accounts
and operations are subject to periodic examination by the Office of the
Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin (the "Wisconsin
Commissioner") and other state insurance regulatory authorities. See Note 9 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Ambac Financial Group's 2001
Annual Report to Stockholders.

         Ambac Financial Group believes that Ambac Assurance is in material
compliance with all applicable insurance laws and regulations.

         Insurance Holding Company Laws

         Under the Wisconsin insurance holding company laws, any acquisition of
control of Ambac Financial Group and thereby indirect control of Ambac Assurance
requires the prior approval of the Wisconsin Commissioner. "Control" is defined
as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of a person. Any purchaser of 10% or more of the
outstanding voting stock of a corporation is presumed to have acquired control
of that corporation and its subsidiaries unless the Wisconsin Commissioner, upon
application, determines otherwise. For purposes of this test, Ambac Financial
Group believes that a holder of common stock having the right to cast 10% of the
votes which may be cast by the holders of all shares of common stock of Ambac
Financial Group would be deemed to have control of Ambac Assurance within the
meaning of the Wisconsin Insurance Laws.

         Pursuant to these laws, JP Morgan Chase obtained approval from the
Wisconsin Insurance Commissioner to acquire greater than 10% of Ambac Financial
Group's outstanding stock. As of December 31, 2001 their percentage of ownership
was approximately 14.7%. In

                                       17

<PAGE>

their request for approval from the Wisconsin Commissioner, JP Morgan Chase
disclaimed any present intention to exercise control over Ambac Financial Group
or Ambac Assurance or to control or attempt to control the management or
operations of Ambac Financial Group or Ambac Assurance.

         The Wisconsin insurance holding company laws also require prior
approval by the Wisconsin Commissioner of certain transactions between Ambac
Assurance and companies affiliated with Ambac Assurance.

         Wisconsin Dividend Restrictions

         Pursuant to the Wisconsin Insurance Laws, Ambac Assurance may declare
dividends, subject to any restriction in its articles of incorporation, provided
that, after giving effect to the distribution, it would not violate certain
statutory equity, solvency, income and asset tests. Distributions to the
shareholder (other than stock dividends) must be reported to the Wisconsin
Commissioner. Extraordinary dividends must be reported prior to payment and are
subject to disapproval by the Wisconsin Commissioner. An extraordinary dividend
is defined as a dividend or distribution, the fair market value of which,
together with all dividends from the preceding 12 months, exceeds the lesser of:
(a) 10% of policyholders' surplus as of the preceding December 31; or (b) the
greater of: (i) statutory net income for the calendar year preceding the date of
the dividend or distribution, minus realized capital gains for that calendar
year; or (ii) the aggregate of statutory net income for the three calendar years
preceding the date of the dividend or distribution, minus realized capital gains
for those calendar years and minus dividends paid or credited and distributions
made within the first two of the preceding three calendar years.

         During 2001, 2000 and 1999, Ambac Assurance paid to Ambac Financial
Group, Inc. cash dividends on its common stock totaling $68.0 million, $59.8
million and $52.0 million, respectively. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in Ambac Financial Group's 2001 Annual Report to
Stockholders.

         Statutory Contingency Reserve

         Ambac Assurance is required to establish a mandatory contingency
reserve in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
("NAIC") Accounting Practices and Procedures manual ("NAIC SAP"). Under NAIC
SAP, financial guarantors are required to establish a contingency reserve equal
to the greater of 50% of premiums written, or a stated percentage of the
principal guaranteed depending on the category of obligation insured.
Contributions are required to be made in equal quarterly installments over a
period of 20 years for municipal bonds and 15 years for all other obligations.
Contributions may be discontinued if the total reserve established for all
categories exceeds the sum of the stated percentages contained therein
multiplied by the unpaid principal balance. This reserve must be maintained for
the periods specified above, except that the guarantor may be permitted to
release reserves under specified circumstances in the event that actual loss
experience exceeds certain thresholds or if the reserve accumulated is deemed
excessive in relation to the guarantor's outstanding guaranteed obligations,
with notice to or approval by the insurance commissioner.

         New York Financial Guarantee Insurance Law

         New York's comprehensive financial guarantee insurance law governs the
conduct of business of all financial guarantors licensed to do business in New
York, including Ambac

                                       18

<PAGE>

Assurance. Financial guarantors are also required to maintain case basis loss
and loss adjustment expense reserves and unearned premium reserves on bases
established by the regulations.

         The New York financial guarantee insurance law establishes single risk
limits with respect to obligations insured by financial guaranty insurers. Such
limits are specific to the type of insured obligation (for example, municipal or
asset-backed). The limits generally compare the insured principal amount
outstanding and/or average annual debt service on the insured obligations, net
of reinsurance and collateral, for a single risk to the insurer's qualified
statutory capital, which is defined as the sum of the insurer's policyholders'
surplus and contingency reserves. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, Ambac
Assurance and its subsidiaries were in compliance with these regulatory
requirements.

         Aggregate risk limits are also established on the basis of aggregate
net liability and policyholders' surplus requirements. "Aggregate net liability"
is defined as outstanding principal and interest of guaranteed obligations, net
of reinsurance and collateral. Under these limits, policyholders' surplus and
contingency reserves must at least equal a percentage of aggregate net liability
that is equal to the sum of various percentages of aggregate net liability for
various categories of specified obligations. The percentage varies from 0.33%
for municipal bonds to 4.00% for certain non-investment grade obligations.

         Financial Guarantee Insurance Regulation in Other States

         The Wisconsin insurance laws and regulations governing municipal bond
guarantors are similar to those in New York. The Wisconsin regulations also
include certain single and aggregate risk limitations. The average annual debt
service for any single issue of municipal bonds may not exceed 10% of Ambac
Assurance's policyholders' surplus. In addition, Ambac Assurance's cumulative
net liability, defined as one-third of one percent of the guaranteed unpaid
principal and interest covered by current municipal bond insurance policies, may
not exceed its qualified statutory capital, which is defined as the sum of its
capital and surplus and contingency reserve.

         California has financial guarantee insurance laws similar in structure
to those of New York. None of the risk limits established in California's
legislation with respect to business transacted by Ambac Assurance are more
stringent in any material respect than the corresponding provisions in the New
York financial guarantee insurance statute.

         In addition to the laws and regulations of New York, Wisconsin and
California, Ambac Assurance is subject to laws and regulations of other states
concerning the transaction of financial guarantees, none of which is more
stringent in any material respect than the New York financial guarantee
insurance statute.

Financial Services

         Ambac Financial Group's Financial Services segment provides financial
and investment products including investment agreements; interest rate and total
return swaps; funding conduits; investment advisory and cash management
services, principally to its financial guarantee clients which include
municipalities and their authorities, school districts, health care
organizations and asset-backed issuers.

                                       19

<PAGE>

         Financial services revenues are primarily derived from: (i) net
investment income; (ii) net swap revenues; (iii) fund management and advisory
revenues; and (iv) net realized gains and losses on sales of securities. Total
revenues were $49.2 million, $53.6 million and $48.5 million in 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis" and Note 17 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Ambac Financial Group's 2001
Annual Report to Stockholders.

         The principal competitive factors among providers of financial service
products that Ambac Financial Group offers are: (1) pricing of contracts; (2)
investment returns; (3) the financial strength of the financial guarantee
provider; (4) the ability to provide services tailored to customers' needs; and
(5) the quality of service provided to customers. With respect to each of these
competitive factors, Ambac Financial Group believes that it is on equal footing
with its principal competitors.

         Investment Agreements

         The principal purpose of Ambac Capital Funding is providing investment
agreements, including repurchase agreements, primarily to municipalities
and their authorities and structured finance entities. Investment
agreements are used by municipal bond issuers to invest bond proceeds until
such proceeds can be used for their intended purpose, such as financing
construction. Investment agreements used in structured financings provide a
guaranteed investment return customized to meet expected cash flow
requirements. The investment agreement provides for the guaranteed return
of principal invested, as well as the payment of interest thereon at a
guaranteed rate and is rated triple-A by virtue of Ambac Assurance's
financial guarantee policy, which guarantees its payment obligations.

         Ambac Capital Funding manages its balance sheet to protect against a
number of risks inherent in its business including liquidity, market
(principally interest rate), credit, operational and legal risk. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis -- Risk Management" in Ambac Financial
Group's 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders. Ambac Capital Funding is managed
with the goal of matching the payment schedule of the invested assets, including
hedges, to the payment schedule of the investment agreement liabilities in order
to minimize market and liquidity risk.

         A source of liquidity risk is the ability of some counterparties to
withdraw moneys on dates other than those specified in the draw down schedule.
Liquidity risk is somewhat mitigated by provisions in certain of the investment
agreements that limit an issuer's ability to draw on the funds and by risk
management procedures that require the regular re-evaluation and re-projection
of draw down schedules. Investments are restricted to fixed income securities
with a credit quality such that the overall minimum average portfolio credit
quality is maintained at Aa/AA. Based upon management's projections, Ambac
Capital Funding maintains funds invested in cash and cash equivalents to meet
short-term liquidity needs.

         The following table sets forth the net payments due under Ambac Capital
Funding's settled investment agreements in each of the next five years ending
December 31 and the period thereafter, based on expected call dates:

         (1) As of December 31, 2001, the interest rates on these agreements
ranged from 2.0% to 8.1%.

         Ambac Capital Funding may use interest rate swap contracts in the
normal course of business for hedging purposes as part of its overall cash flow
risk management. Some of its interest rate swap agreements have been entered
into with its affiliate, Ambac Financial Services. Interest rate swap contracts
are agreements where Ambac Capital Funding agrees with other parties to
exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and
floating-rate interest amounts or the difference between different interest rate
indices calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount.


          Derivative Products

         Ambac Financial Services provides interest rate swaps and other
derivative products primarily to states, municipalities and their authorities,
asset-backed entities and other entities in connection with their financings.
Ambac Financial Services generally hedges its transactions with clients to
eliminate sensitivity to overall interest rates. On interest rate swaps for
municipals, Ambac Financial Services is subject to changes in the relationship
between tax-exempt and taxable interest rates, referred to as "basis risk." If
actual or projected tax-exempt interest rates change in relation to taxable
rates, Ambac Financial Services may experience a mark-to-market gain or loss.
Most municipal interest rate swaps transacted by Ambac Financial Services
contain provisions that are designed to protect Ambac Financial Group against
certain forms of tax reform, thus mitigating its basis risk. The interest rate
swaps provided by Ambac Financial Services are guaranteed by Ambac Assurance
through policies that guarantee the obligations of Ambac Financial Services and
its counterparties. Total return swaps are only used for fixed income
obligations, which meet Ambac Assurance's credit underwriting criteria.

         Ambac Financial Services is a limited partnership. Ambac Assurance, the
sole limited partner, owns a limited partnership interest representing 90% of
the total partnership interests of Ambac Financial Services. Ambac Financial
Services Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ambac Financial Group, the
sole general partner, owns a general partnership interest representing 10% of
the total partnership interest in Ambac Financial Services.

         Ambac Financial Services manages a variety of risks inherent in its
business, including credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal. These
risks are identified, measured, and monitored through a variety of control
mechanisms, which are in place at different levels throughout the organization.
See "Management's Discussion and Analysis - Risk Management" in Ambac Financial
Group's 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders.


         Investment Advisory and Cash Management

         Cadre Financial Services is registered as an investment adviser with
the SEC. As a registered adviser, Cadre Financial Services is subject to
regulation in certain aspects of its

                                       21

<PAGE>

business, particularly with respect to investment advisory services provided to
investment companies and clients. Cadre Financial Services provides investment
advisory and administrative services to money market funds that are primarily
offered to qualified participants, including school districts, health care
service providers and municipalities.

      Cadre Securities' principal business is the distribution of money market
funds to the education, health care and municipal sectors, as well as the
brokering of short-term fixed income securities trades on behalf of its clients.
It also serves as placement agent and dealer for securities issued by its
affiliates in private placement transactions. Cadre Securities is registered as
a broker-dealer with the SEC and with certain states that require such
registration, and it is a member of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. As a registered broker-dealer, Cadre Securities is subject to the
net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, which is designed to measure the general financial condition and
liquidity of a broker-dealer. In accordance with this rule, the ratio of
aggregate indebtedness to net capital ("net capital ratio") shall not exceed 15
to 1. At December 31, 2001, Cadre Securities had net capital of approximately
$0.7 million, which was $0.6 million in excess of its required net capital of
$100 thousand. The net capital ratio was 1.8 to 1.

      At December 31, 2001, Cadre Financial Services and Cadre Securities
provided services to approximately 2,700 clients with approximately $7.5 billion
in assets.

      Fees from the money market funds for which Cadre Financial Services and
Cadre Securities perform services are based on percentages of the average daily
net assets of such funds. Cadre Securities receives fees for brokering
short-term fixed income securities trades by marking up the price of the
securities purchased and sold on behalf of clients. These fees are recorded upon
execution of the trades since, at that time, substantially all of Cadre
Securities' obligations have been fulfilled.

Investments and Investment Policy

      As of December 31, 2001, the consolidated investments of Ambac Financial
Group had an aggregate fair value of approximately $10.3 billion and an
aggregate amortized cost of approximately $10.2 billion. These investments are
managed internally by officers of Ambac Financial Group, who are experienced
investment managers. All investments are effected in accordance with the general
objectives and guidelines for investments established by each subsidiary's Board
of Directors. These guidelines encompass credit quality, risk concentration and
holding period, and are periodically reviewed and revised as appropriate.

      Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," Ambac
Financial Group has designated all investments as "available-for-sale" and
reports them at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from
earnings and reported as a component of "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
(Loss)", in stockholders' equity, net of tax.

      As of December 31, 2001, Ambac Assurance's investment portfolio had an
aggregate fair value of approximately $5.3 billion and an aggregate amortized
cost of approximately $5.1 billion. Ambac Assurance's investment policy is
designed to achieve diversification of its portfolio and only permits investment
in investment grade fixed income securities, consistent with its goal to achieve
the highest after-tax, long-term return. This policy takes into consideration
Ambac Assurance's desire for both current income and long-term capital growth.
Ambac Assurance is subject to limits on types and quality of investments imposed
by the insurance laws and regulations of the States of Wisconsin and New York.
In compliance with

                                       22

<PAGE>

these laws, Ambac Assurance's Board of Directors approves each specific
investment transaction of Ambac Assurance. See "Insurance Regulatory Matters -
General Law," above.

         As of December 31, 2001, the investment agreement business investment
portfolio had an aggregate fair value of approximately $5.0 billion and an
aggregate amortized cost of approximately $5.0 billion. Ambac Capital Funding's
investment policy is designed to achieve the highest after-tax return on equity,
subject to minimum average quality ratings. For further discussion, see
"Investment Agreements," above.
