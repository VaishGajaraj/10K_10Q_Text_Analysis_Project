ITEM 1. BUSINESS

                                     GENERAL

     Developments  relating  to  individual  aspects  of  the  business  of  BOK
Financial  Corporation  ("BOK  Financial" or "the Company") are described below.
Additional  discussion  of the Company's  activities  during the current year is
incorporated  by reference to the  "Management's  Assessment of  Operations  and
Financial   Condition"   section  of  BOK  Financial's  2004  Annual  Report  to
Shareholders (the "2004 Annual Report").  Information  regarding BOK Financial's
acquisitions  is  incorporated  by reference to Note 2 of "Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements" within the 2004 Annual Report.

                             DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

     BOK Financial is a financial  holding company whose  activities are limited
by the Bank Holding  Company Act of 1956  ("BHCA"),  as amended by the Financial
Services Modernization Act or Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act. BOK Financial offers full
service banking in Oklahoma, Dallas and Houston, Texas, Albuquerque, New Mexico,
Northwest Arkansas,  and Denver,  Colorado.  Principal  subsidiaries are Bank of
Oklahoma, N.A. ("BOk"), Bank of Texas, N.A., Bank of Albuquerque,  N.A., Bank of
Arkansas,  N.A.  and  Colorado  State Bank and Trust,  N.A.  (collectively,  the
"Banks"). Other subsidiaries include BOSC, Inc., a broker/dealer that engages in
retail and institutional securities sales and municipal bond underwriting. Other
non-bank subsidiary operations are not significant.

     Our overall  strategic  objective is to emphasize growth in long-term value
by  building  on  our  leadership   position  in  Oklahoma  and  expanding  into
high-growth  markets in contiguous  states. We have a solid position in Oklahoma
and are the state's largest financial  institution as measured by deposit market
share. Since 1997, we have expanded into Dallas and Houston, Texas, Albuquerque,
New Mexico,  Denver,  Colorado, and have recently announced plans to expand into
Phoenix, Arizona.

     Our primary  focus is to provide a broad range of  financial  products  and
services,  including  loans and deposits,  cash management  services,  fiduciary
services,  mortgage banking, and brokerage and trading services to middle-market
businesses,  financial  institutions,  and  consumers.  Our revenue  sources are
diversified. Approximately 42% of our revenue comes from commissions and fees.

     Commercial  banking  is a  significant  part of our  business.  Our  credit
culture  emphasizes  building  relationships  by making  high-quality  loans and
providing a full range of financial products and services to our customers.

     Our  acquisition   strategy   targets  quality   organizations   that  have
demonstrated  solid growth in their business lines. We provide additional growth
opportunities by hiring talent to enhance competitiveness, adding locations, and
broadening  product   offerings.   Our  operating   philosophy   embraces  local
decision-making   through  the  boards  of  directors   for  each  of  our  bank
subsidiaries.

     BOK  Financial's  corporate  headquarters  is located  at Bank of  Oklahoma
Tower, P.O. Box 2300, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74192.

     The Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K,  Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q,
Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available on the
Company's  website at www.bokf.com as soon as reasonably  practicable  after the
Company  electronically  files  such  material  with  or  furnishes  it  to  the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

                               OPERATING SEGMENTS

     BOK Financial operates five principal lines of business: Oklahoma corporate
banking,  Oklahoma consumer banking,  mortgage banking,  wealth management,  and
regional  banking.  Mortgage  banking  activities  include loan  origination and
servicing across all markets served by the Company.  Wealth management  provides
brokerage  and  trading,  private  financial  services and  investment  advisory
services in all  markets.  It also  provides  fiduciary  services in all markets
except  Colorado.  Fiduciary  services  in  Colorado  are  included  in regional
banking.  Regional banking consists  primarily of corporate and consumer banking
activities in the respective local markets.  Discussion of these principal lines
of business is incorporated by reference to the Lines of Business section within
"Management's  Assessment of Operations and Financial Condition" within the 2004
Annual  Report and to Note 18 of "Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements"
within the 2004 Annual Report.

                                   COMPETITION

     BOK Financial and its operating segments face competition from other banks,
thrifts,  credit  unions  and other  non-bank  financial  institutions,  such as
investment banking firms, investment advisory firms, brokerage firms, investment
companies,  government agencies,  mortgage brokers and insurance companies.  The
Company  competes largely on the basis of customer  services,  interest rates on
loans and deposits,  lending  limits and customer  convenience.  Some  operating
segments face competition from institutions that are not as closely regulated as
banks, and therefore are not limited by the same capital

<PAGE> 4

requirements  and other  restrictions.  All market share  information  presented
below is based  upon share of  deposits  in  specified  areas  according  to SNL
DataSource as of December 31, 2004.

     BOk is the largest banking  subsidiary of BOK Financial and has the largest
market share in Oklahoma  with 13% of the state's total  deposits.  In the Tulsa
and Oklahoma City areas, BOk has 29% and 10% of the market share,  respectively.
BOk competes  with two banks that have  operations  nationwide  and have greater
access to funds at lower costs,  higher  lending  limits,  and greater access to
technology resources. BOk also competes with regional and locally owned banks in
both the Tulsa and Oklahoma City areas,  as well as in every other  community in
which we do business throughout the state.

     Through other subsidiary banks, BOK Financial competes in Dallas-Fort Worth
and Houston,  Texas,  Albuquerque,  New Mexico, Denver,  Colorado, and Northwest
Arkansas.  Bank of  Texas  competes  against  numerous  financial  institutions,
including  some of the largest in the United  States,  and has a market share of
approximately   2%  and  1%  in  the   Dallas-Fort   Worth  and  Houston  areas,
respectively.  Bank of Albuquerque has a number three market share position with
11% of deposits in the  Albuquerque  area and competes  with two large  national
banks,  some regional banks and several  locally-owned  smaller community banks.
Colorado  State  Bank and Trust has a market  share of  approximately  1% in the
Denver area.  Bank of Arkansas  operates as a community  bank serving Benton and
Washington counties in Arkansas. The Company's ability to expand into additional
states remains subject to various federal and state laws.

                                    EMPLOYEES

     As of December 31, 2004, BOK Financial and its subsidiaries  employed 3,548
full-time equivalent employees.  None of the Company's employees are represented
by collective bargaining agreements. Management considers its employee relations
to be good.

                           SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

     BOK Financial  and its  subsidiaries  are subject to extensive  regulations
under  federal  and state  laws.  These  regulations  are  designed  to  protect
depositors,  the Bank  Insurance  Fund and the banking system as a whole and not
necessarily to protect  shareholders  and creditors.  As detailed  below,  these
regulations  may restrict the Company's  ability to diversify,  to acquire other
institutions  and to pay dividends on its capital  stock.  They also may require
the Company to provide financial  support to its subsidiaries,  maintain certain
capital balances and pay higher deposit insurance premiums.

     Proposals to change laws and regulations governing the banking industry are
frequently  introduced in Congress,  in the state  legislatures  and before bank
regulatory  agencies.  The  likelihood  and  timing  of  any  new  proposals  or
legislation  and the impact they might have on the Company and its  subsidiaries
cannot be predicted at this time.

     The following  information  summarizes  certain laws and  regulations  that
affect the  Company's  operations.  It does not discuss all  provisions of these
laws and  regulations  and it does not summarize all laws and  regulations  that
affect the Company.

GENERAL

     As a financial  holding company,  BOK Financial is regulated under the BHCA
and is subject to regular  inspection,  examination and supervision by the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board").  Under
the BHCA, BOK Financial files quarterly  reports and other  information with the
Federal Reserve Board.

     The Banks are organized as national banking associations under the National
Banking Act, and are subject to regulation,  supervision  and examination by the
Office of the  Comptroller  of the  Currency  (the "OCC"),  the Federal  Deposit
Insurance  Corporation (the "FDIC"), the Federal Reserve Board and other federal
and state regulatory  agencies.  The OCC has primary supervisory  responsibility
for national  banks and must approve  certain  corporate or structural  changes,
including changes in  capitalization,  payment of dividends,  change of place of
business,  and  establishment  of a  branch  or  operating  subsidiary.  The OCC
performs its functions  through national bank examiners who provide the OCC with
information  concerning  the  soundness  of a  national  bank,  the  quality  of
management  and directors,  and  compliance  with  applicable  regulations.  The
National  Banking Act authorizes the OCC to examine every national bank as often
as necessary.

     A financial  holding  company,  and the  companies  under its control,  are
permitted to engage in activities considered "financial in nature" as defined by
the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act and  Federal  Reserve  Board  interpretations,  and
therefore may engage in a broader range of  activities  than  permitted for bank
holding  companies and their  subsidiaries.  Activities  that are  "financial in
nature" include  securities  underwriting and dealing,  insurance  underwriting,
operating  a  mortgage  company,  credit  card  company  or  factoring  company,
performing  certain  data  processing  operations,  servicing  loans  and  other
extensions of credit,  providing  investment  and financial  advice,  owning and
operating savings and loan associations, and leasing personal property on a full
pay-out,  non-operating  basis.  In order for a  financial  holding  company  to
commence  any new  activity  permitted  by the  BHCA,  each  insured  depository
institution  subsidiary  of the financial  holding  company must have received a
rating  of at  least  satisfactory  in its most  recent  examination  under  the
Community  Reinvestment  Act. A financial  holding company is required to notify
the Federal  Reserve  Board  within  thirty  days of engaging in new  activities
determined  to be  "financial  in nature."  BOK  Financial is engaged in some of
these activities and has notified the Federal Reserve Board.

<PAGE> 5

     The BHCA requires the Federal Reserve Board's prior approval for the direct
or indirect  acquisition  of more than five percent of any class of voting stock
of any  non-affiliated  bank.  Under the  Federal  Bank  Merger  Act,  the prior
approval of the OCC is required  for a national  bank to merge with another bank
or purchase  the assets or assume the  deposits of another  bank.  In  reviewing
applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition  transactions,  the bank
regulatory authorities consider,  among other things, the competitive effect and
public  benefits  of the  transactions,  the capital  position  of the  combined
organization,   the   applicant's   performance   record  under  the   Community
Reinvestment  Act and fair  housing  laws and the  effectiveness  of the subject
organizations in combating money laundering activities.

     A financial  holding company and its  subsidiaries are prohibited under the
BHCA from  engaging  in  certain  tie-in  arrangements  in  connection  with the
provision of any credit, property or services. Thus, a subsidiary of a financial
holding  company  may not extend  credit,  lease or sell  property,  furnish any
services or fix or vary the  consideration for these activities on the condition
that (1) the customer obtain or provide additional credit,  property or services
from or to the financial holding company or any subsidiary  thereof,  or (2) the
customer  may  not  obtain  some  other  credit,  property  or  services  from a
competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to insure the
soundness of credit extended.

     The Banks and other non-bank subsidiaries are also subject to other federal
and  state  laws  and  regulations.  For  example,  BOSC,  Inc.,  the  Company's
broker/dealer  subsidiary  that engages in retail and  institutional  securities
sales and  municipal  bond  underwriting,  is  regulated by the  Securities  and
Exchange Commission,  the National Association of Securities Dealers,  Inc., the
Federal Reserve Board,  the National  Futures  Association and state  securities
regulators.  As  another  example,  Bank  of  Arkansas  is  subject  to  certain
consumer-protection laws incorporated in the Arkansas Constitution, which, among
other  restrictions,  limit the maximum  interest  rate on general loans to five
percent above the Federal  Reserve  Discount Rate and limit the rate on consumer
loans to the lower of five percent above the discount rate or seventeen percent.

CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION

     The Federal Reserve Board,  the OCC and the FDIC have issued  substantially
similar risk-based and leverage capital  guidelines  applicable to United States
banking  organizations  to ensure capital adequacy based upon the risk levels of
assets  and  off-balance  sheet  financial  instruments.   In  addition,   these
regulatory  agencies may from time to time  require that a banking  organization
maintain  capital  above the minimum  levels,  whether  because of its financial
condition or actual or  anticipated  growth.  Capital  adequacy  guidelines  and
prompt corrective action regulations  involve  quantitative  measures of assets,
liabilities,  and certain  off-balance  sheet items  calculated under regulatory
accounting  practices.  Capital amounts and  classifications are also subject to
qualitative  judgments by regulators  regarding  components,  risk weighting and
other factors.

     The Federal Reserve Board risk-based guidelines define a three-tier capital
framework.  Core  capital  (Tier 1)  includes  common  shareholders'  equity and
qualifying  preferred  stock,  less goodwill,  most intangible  assets and other
adjustments.  Supplementary  capital  (Tier 2) consists of  preferred  stock not
qualifying as Tier 1 capital,  qualifying mandatory convertible debt securities,
limited amounts of subordinated  debt, other qualifying term debt and allowances
for credit losses, subject to limitations. Market risk capital (Tier 3) includes
qualifying  unsecured  subordinated debt. Assets and off-balance sheet exposures
are assigned to one of four  categories of  risk-weights,  based  primarily upon
relative credit risk.  Risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing Tier
1 and total capital by risk-weighted assets. For a depository  institution to be
considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective
action,  the  institution's  Tier 1 and total capital ratios must be at least 6%
and 10% on a  risk-adjusted  basis,  respectively.  As of December 31, 2004, BOK
Financial's  Tier 1 and total capital ratios under these  guidelines were 10.02%
and 11.67%, respectively.

     The leverage  ratio is  determined  by dividing  Tier 1 capital by adjusted
average total assets.  Banking organizations are required to maintain a ratio of
at least 5% to be classified as well capitalized. BOK Financial's leverage ratio
at December 31, 2004 was 7.94%.

     The Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  Improvement  Act of 1991 (the
"FDICIA"),  among other things,  identifies five capital  categories for insured
depository institutions from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized and
requires the respective  federal  regulatory  agencies to implement  systems for
prompt  corrective  action  for  institutions  failing to meet  minimum  capital
requirements   within  such  categories.   FDICIA  imposes   progressively  more
restrictive  covenants  on  operations,  management  and capital  distributions,
depending upon the category in which an institution is classified.

     The  various  regulatory  agencies  have  adopted   substantially   similar
regulations that define the five capital categories  identified by FDICIA, using
the total  risk-based  capital,  Tier 1 risk-based  capital and leverage capital
ratios as the relevant  capital  measures.  Such regulations  establish  various
degrees of  corrective  action to be taken  when an  institution  is  considered
undercapitalized.  Under these guidelines, each of the Banks was considered well
capitalized as of December 31, 2004.

     The federal regulatory authorities' risk-based capital guidelines are based
upon the 1988 capital accord of the Basel Committee on Banking  Supervision (the
"BCBS").  The BCBS is a committee of central banks and bank  regulators from the
major industrialized  countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by
each country's supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply.

<PAGE> 6

     In January  2001,  the BCBS released a proposal to replace the 1988 capital
accord  with a new  capital  accord  that  would set  capital  requirements  for
operational  risk and refine the existing  capital  requirements for credit risk
and market  risk  exposures.  Operational  risk  refers to the risk of direct or
indirect losses resulting from failed internal  processes,  people, and systems.
The 1988  capital  accord does not include  separate  capital  requirements  for
operational risk.

     In June 2004,  the BCBS published the framework for a new set of risk-based
capital standards. Release of proposed rules to implement the new capital accord
is  currently  expected  in  mid-2005.  Release of final  rules is  expected  by
mid-2006,  and final rules are expected to become  effective in early 2008.  The
ultimate  timing and final form of a new accord are  uncertain.  However,  it is
possible  that a new capital  accord will  eventually be adopted by the BCBS and
implemented by the United States federal bank  regulatory  authorities.  The new
capital  requirements  that may arise from a new capital  accord could  increase
minimum capital requirements applicable to BOK Financial and its subsidiaries.

     Further  discussion of regulatory  capital,  including  regulatory  capital
amounts and ratios,  is incorporated by reference to information set forth under
the caption  "Borrowings  and Capital"  within the  Management's  Assessment  of
Operations and Financial Condition section and Note 16 of "Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements" of the 2004 Annual Report.

DIVIDENDS

     The primary  source of liquidity  for BOK  Financial is dividends  from the
Banks,  which are limited by various  banking  regulations  to net  profits,  as
defined,  for the year plus  retained  profits for the  preceding  two years and
further  restricted  by  minimum  capital   requirements.   Based  on  the  most
restrictive  limitations,  the Banks had  excess  regulatory  capital  and could
declare up to $161  million  of  dividends  without  regulatory  approval  as of
December 31, 2004.  BOK  Financial  management  has  developed  and the Board of
Directors has approved an internal  capital policy that is more restrictive than
the regulatory  standards.  Under this policy, the Banks could declare dividends
of up to $98 million as of December 31, 2004.  These amounts are not necessarily
indicative of amounts that may be available to be paid in future periods.

SOURCE OF STRENGTH DOCTRINE

     According to Federal  Reserve  Board  policy,  bank holding  companies  are
expected to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to
commit resources to support each such  subsidiary.  This support may be required
at times when a bank holding  company may not be able to provide  such  support.
Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act,  in the event of a loss  suffered  by the FDIC as a result of  default of a
banking  subsidiary  or related to FDIC  assistance  provided to a subsidiary in
danger of default,  the other Banks may be assessed for the FDIC's loss, subject
to certain exceptions.

                   GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES AND ECONOMIC FACTORS

     The  operations  of BOK  Financial  and its  subsidiaries  are  affected by
legislative  changes and by the policies of various regulatory  authorities and,
in particular,  the credit  policies of the Federal  Reserve Board. An important
function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the national supply of bank
credit to moderate  recessions  and curb  inflation.  Among the  instruments  of
monetary  policy used by the Federal  Reserve Board to implement its  objectives
are:  open-market  operations  in U.S.  Government  securities,  changes  in the
discount rate and federal funds rate on bank borrowings,  and changes in reserve
requirements on bank deposits.  The effect of future changes in such policies on
the business and earnings of BOK Financial and its subsidiaries is uncertain.

     In 2002, the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the "Act") was signed into law to address
many aspects of financial  reporting,  corporate  governance  and public company
disclosure.  Among other things,  the Act establishes a comprehensive  framework
for  the  oversight  of  public  company  auditing  and  for  strengthening  the
independence of auditors and audit  committees.  Under the Act, audit committees
are responsible for the  appointment,  compensation and oversight of the work of
the auditors.  The  non-audit  services that can be provided to a company by its
auditor are  limited.  Audit  committee  members  are subject to specific  rules
addressing their  independence.  The Act also requires  enhanced and accelerated
financial disclosures,  and it establishes various responsibility measures, such
as requiring the chief executive  officer and chief financial officer to certify
to  the  quality  of  the  company's  financial   reporting.   The  Act  imposes
restrictions  on and  accelerated  reporting  requirements  for certain  insider
trading  activities.  It  imposes a  variety  of  penalties  for fraud and other
violations and creates a federal felony for securities  fraud.  Various sections
of the Act are applicable to BOK  Financial.  Portions of the Act were effective
immediately;  others  became  effective or are in process of becoming  effective
through rulings by the SEC, based on timelines set forth in the law.

                               FOREIGN OPERATIONS

     BOK Financial does not engage in operations in foreign countries,  nor does
it lend to foreign governments.
