ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

                         GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS


Developments  relating to  individual  aspects of the business of BOK  Financial
Corporation ("BOK Financial") are described below.  Additional discussion of BOK
Financial's  activities  during the current year is incorporated by reference to
"Management's  Assessment of Operations and Financial Condition" (pages 10 - 29)
in BOK Financial's 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders. Information regarding BOK
Financial's  acquisitions  is  incorporated  by reference to Note 2 of "Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements"  (page 40) in BOK  Financial's  2002 Annual
Report to Shareholders.

                        NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

BOK Financial is a financial holding company whose activities are limited by the
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 ("BHCA"),  as amended by the Financial Services
Modernization  Act  or  Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act.  BOK  Financial's  banking  and
bank-related  activities are primarily performed through Bank of Oklahoma,  N.A.
("BOk"),  Bank of Texas,  N.A., Bank of Albuquerque  N.A., and Bank of Arkansas,
N.A. Other  significant  operating  subsidiaries  include BOSC, Inc., which is a
full-service  securities firm with specialized expertise in public and municipal
finance and private  placements.  Other nonbank  subsidiary  operations  are not
significant.  As of December 31, 2002,  BOK Financial and its  subsidiaries  had
3,402 full-time equivalent employees.

BOK Financial provides copies of all quarterly  financial  statements under Form
10-Q and annual financial statements under form 10-K on its website www.bokf.com
within 24 hours of filing with the SEC.

                                INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

BOK Financial operates four principal lines of business under its BOk franchise:
corporate  banking,  consumer banking,  mortgage banking and trust services.  It
also operates a fifth principal line of business,  regional banks, which include
banking  functions for Bank of Albuquerque,  Bank of Arkansas and Bank of Texas.
These five principal lines of business combined account for approximately 80% of
total revenue.  Discussion of these  principal lines of business is incorporated
by reference to Lines of Business in "Management's  Assessment of Operations and
Financial  Condition  " (pages 14 - 17) and Note 18 of  "Notes  to  Consolidated
Financial  Statements"  (pages 54 - 57) in BOK Financial's 2002 Annual Report to
Shareholders.

                                   COMPETITION

The  banking  industry  in  each  of our  markets  is  highly  competitive.  BOK
Financial, through four subsidiary banks, competes with other banks in obtaining
deposits, making loans and providing additional services related to banking. All
market share  information  below is based on share of deposits in specified area
based on SNL DataSource.

BOk is the  largest  banking  subsidiary  of BOK  Financial.  It has the largest
market share in Oklahoma with 12 percent of the state's total deposits according
to SNL DataSource.  BOk competes with two super-regional banks, several regional
and numerous  locally owned banks in both the Tulsa and Oklahoma City areas,  as
well as in every other community in which we do business  throughout the rest of
the state.

BOK Financial  competes in the Dallas-Ft.  Worth combined  metropolitan area, in
the Houston, Texas area, in the Albuquerque, New Mexico market, and in Northwest
Arkansas  through  subsidiary  banks.  Bank of Texas competes  against  numerous
financial institutions, including some of the largest in the United States. Bank
of Texas's market share is approximately 2% in the Dallas-Ft.  Worth area and 1%
in the Houston market  according to SNL  DataSource.  Bank of Albuquerque  has a
number four market share position in the Albuquerque  area and competes with two
super-regional  banks,  some regional  banks and several  locally-owned  smaller
community  banks.  Bank of Arkansas  operates as a community bank serving Benton
and Washington counties in Arkansas.

                           SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

Financial  holding  companies  and banks are  extensively  regulated  under both
federal and state law.  The  following  information,  to the extent it describes
statutory or regulatory provisions, is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the  particular  statutory  and  regulatory  provisions.  It is not  possible to
predict  the  changes,  if any,  that may be made to existing  banking  laws and
regulations or whether such changes,  if made,  would have a materially  adverse
effect on the business and prospects of BOK Financial,  BOk, Bank of Texas, Bank
of Albuquerque, or Bank of Arkansas.

During  2002  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002  was  signed  into  law.  The Act
addressed many aspects of financial accounting,  corporate governance and public
company  disclosures.  The Act  established  a  comprehensive  framework for the
oversight  of public  company  auditing and  strengthened  the  independence  of
auditors and audit  committees.  The Act also required  enhanced and accelerated
financial  disclosures,   and  established  various   responsibility   measures,
including the certification of the quality of financial reporting by the CEO and
CFO. The Act also imposed new restrictions on accelerated reporting requirements
for certain  insider  trading  activities and imposed a variety of new penalties
for fraud and other  violations  including a new federal  felony for  securities
fraud. Various sections of the Act are applicable to BOK Financial.  Portions of
the act were effective immediately and others became effective or are in process
of becoming effective through rulings by the SEC.

BOK FINANCIAL

As a financial holding company, BOK Financial is subject to regulation under the
BHCA   (as   amended   by   the   Financial   Services   Modernization   Act  or
Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act) and to  supervision  by the Board of  Governors  of the
Federal  Reserve  System (the "Reserve  Board").  Under the BHCA,  BOK Financial
files  with the  Reserve  Board  quarterly  reports  and such  other  additional
information  as the Reserve  Board may require.  The Reserve Board may also make
examinations of BOK Financial and its subsidiaries.

The  BHCA  requires  notification  to the  Reserve  Board  in any  case  where a
financial  holding company proposes to acquire control of more than five percent
of the voting shares of any bank,  unless it already controls a majority of such
voting shares.  Additionally,  approval must also be obtained before a financial
holding  company may acquire all or  substantially  all of the assets of another
bank or  before it may  merge or  consolidate  with  another  financial  holding
company.  The BHCA further provides that the Reserve Board shall not approve any
such  acquisition,  merger  or  consolidation  that  will  substantially  lessen
competition,  tend to create a monopoly or be in restraint  of trade,  unless it
finds the  anti-competitive  effects of the  proposed  transaction  are  clearly
outweighed in the public  interest by the probable  effect of the transaction in
meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served.

The BHCA also requires a financial  holding  company to notify the Reserve Board
within 30 days of engaging in new activities the Reserve Board has determined to
be financial in nature.  These  activities  include dealing in and  underwriting
debt and equity,  operating a mortgage  company,  finance  company,  credit card
company or factoring  company;  performing  certain data processing  operations;
servicing  loans  and other  extensions  of  credit;  providing  investment  and
financial advice;  acting as an insurance  underwriter and/or agent;  owning and
operating savings and loan associations; and leasing personal property on a full
pay-out, nonoperating basis. BOKF is already engaged in some of these activities
and has notified the Federal Reserve.

A financial  holding company and its subsidiaries  are further  prohibited under
the BHCA from engaging in certain  tie-in  arrangements  in connection  with the
provision of any credit, property or services. Thus, a subsidiary of a financial
holding  company  may not extend  credit,  lease or sell  property,  furnish any
services or fix or vary the  consideration for these activities on the condition
that (1) the customer  obtain or provide  some  additional  credit,  property or
services from or to the financial  holding company or any subsidiary  thereof or
(2) the customer may not obtain some other  credit,  property or services from a
competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to insure the
soundness of credit extended.

The Federal Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  Improvement Act of 1991 established
five  capital  rating  tiers  ranging  from "well  capitalized"  to  "critically
undercapitalized".  A financial institution is considered to be well capitalized
if its  Leverage,  Tier 1 and  Total  Capital  ratios  are  at 5%,  6% and  10%,
respectively. Any institution experiencing significant growth or acquiring other
institutions  or branches is expected to maintain  capital ratios above the well
capitalized  level. At December 31, 2002, BOK Financial's  Leverage,  Tier 1 and
Total Capital ratios were 6.88%, 8.98% and 11.95%, respectively. At December 31,
2002,  BOK Financial had excess  regulatory  capital of $177 million under these
capital  guidelines.   Further  discussion  of  regulatory  capital,   including
regulatory   capital  amounts  and  ratios,  is  incorporated  by  reference  to
information set forth under the caption "Borrowings and Capital" (pages 26 - 27)
and Note 16 of "Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements"  (page 51 - 53) in
BOK Financial's 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders.

In January 2001, the Basel Committee  proposed its second draft of a new capital
adequacy  framework.  The new capital framework would consist of minimum capital
requirements,  a  supervisory  review  process and the  effective  use of market
discipline.  The  Committee  set out  options  from  which  banks  could  choose
depending  on the  complexity  of their  business  and  quality  of  their  risk
management. One approach is the standard approach which would refine the current
measurement  framework and introduce the use of external  credit  assessments to
determine a bank's  capital  charge.  Banks with more advanced  risk  management
capabilities  could make use of an  internal  risk-rating  based  approach.  The
Committee is also proposing an explicit  capital charge for operational  risk to
provide for problems like internal systems failure.

The  supervisory  review aspect of the new framework would seek to ensure that a
bank's  capital  position  is  consistent  with its  overall  risk  profile  and
strategy. The third aspect of the new framework,  market discipline,  would call
for detailed  disclosure of a bank's capital adequacy in order to encourage high
disclosure  standards  and  to  enhance  the  role  of  market  participants  in
encouraging banks to hold adequate capital.

Due to  concerns  within  the  banking  industry  that  compliance  with the new
framework would be costly and result in increased  regulatory  burden, the Basel
Committee is currently  evaluating the results of a quantitative impact study in
which the largest  banks in the world  completed a model of Basel II to evaluate
the impact and cost of implementation.  The results of this study were published
in October 2002 and are currently being evaluated. A third draft of the proposed
capital rules is expected to be issued during May 2003 and is expected to become
final towards the end of 2003.  Implementation of the new guidelines is expected
by the end of 2006.  BOK Financial  cannot  predict at this time whether the new
capital  adequacy  framework  will be adopted or in what form,  or the effect it
will have on the  financial  condition or results of operations of BOK Financial
or its subsidiary banks.

BANK SUBSIDIARIES

BOk,  Bank of Texas,  Bank of  Albuquerque,  and Bank of Arkansas  are  national
banking  associations  and are  subject to the  National  Banking  Act and other
federal statutes  governing national banks. Under federal law, the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency  ("Comptroller")  charters and serves as the primary
regulator of national banks. In addition,  the Comptroller  must approve certain
corporate  or  structural   changes,   including  an  increase  or  decrease  in
capitalization, payment of dividends, change of place of business, establishment
of a branch  and  establishment  of an  operating  subsidiary.  The  Comptroller
performs  its  functions   through  national  bank  examiners  who  provide  the
Comptroller  with  information  concerning the soundness of a national bank, the
quality of management and directors,  and compliance with applicable laws, rules
and regulations.  The National Banking Act authorizes the Comptroller to examine
every national bank as often as necessary.  Although the Comptroller has primary
supervisory  responsibility for national banks, such banks must also comply with
Reserve Board rules and regulations as members of the Federal Reserve System.

All bank  subsidiaries  must  comply  with the same  capital  guidelines  as the
holding company,  discussed above. Information set forth in Note 16 of "Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements"  (pages 51 - 53) is incorporated  herein by
reference,  including  each  individual  banks  regulatory  capital  amounts and
ratios.

Bank  of  Arkansas  is  also   subject  to  certain   consumer-protection   laws
incorporated  in the Arkansas  Constitution,  which,  among other  restrictions,
limit the  maximum  interest  rate on general  loans to five  percent  above the
Federal Reserve  Discount Rate. The rate on consumer loans is five percent above
the discount rate or seventeen percent, whichever is lower.


                   GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES AND ECONOMIC FACTORS

The operations of BOK Financial and its subsidiaries are affected by legislative
changes  and  by  the  policies  of  various  regulatory   authorities  and,  in
particular,  the credit policies of the Reserve Board. An important  function of
the Reserve Board is to regulate the national  supply of bank credit.  Among the
instruments  of  monetary  policy  used by the Reserve  Board to  implement  its
objectives are: open market operations in U.S. Government securities; changes in
the discount rate on bank  borrowings;  and changes in reserve  requirements  on
bank  deposits.  The effect of such  policies in the future on the  business and
earnings  of BOK  Financial  and  its  subsidiaries  cannot  be  predicted  with
certainty.

                               FOREIGN OPERATIONS

BOK Financial  does not engage in operations in foreign  countries,  nor does it
lend to foreign governments.
