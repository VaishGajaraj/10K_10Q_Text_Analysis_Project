General</FONT></H2>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The Company provides  contract  development  services and research  equipment to
many of the leading  global  pharmaceutical,  medical  device and  biotechnology
companies.  It has played a significant  role in  understanding  the  underlying
causes of central nervous system  disorders,  diabetes,  osteoporosis  and other
diseases  since  its  start in 1974,  when it was  formed  as a  corporation  in
Indiana. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The Company offers an efficient,  variable cost alternative to its clients&#146;
internal product development  programs.  Outsourcing  development work to reduce
overhead  and speed  drug  approvals  through  the Food and Drug  Administration
(&#147;FDA&#148;)  is a growing  trend  among  pharmaceutical  developers.  As a
result, the Company now derives its revenues from sales of its research services
and drug development  tools, both focused on determining the safety and efficacy
of drugs developed by its clients. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The Company supports the preclinical (pharmacokinetics,  toxicology,  pathology)
and clinical development  (formulations,  bioanalysis for clinical trials) needs
of researchers  and clinicians for small molecules  through large  biomolecules.
The Company  believes its  scientists  have the skills  necessary in  analytical
instrumentation   development,   chemistry,   computer   software   development,
physiology and  toxicology,  and the global  presence,  to make the services and
products it provides  increasingly  valuable  to the  worldwide  pharmaceutical,
medical device and biotechnology industries. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Scientists  engaged  in drug  metabolism  studies,  pharmacokinetics  and  basic
neuroscience  research at drug  development  organizations,  many of the largest
global  pharmaceutical  companies,  are the  Company&#146;s  principal  clients.

<i>PharmaKinetics Laboratories, Inc.</i></font></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
On June 20, 2002, the Company, PI Acquisition Corp., a Maryland  corporation and
a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the  Company  (&#147;Acquisition&#148;),   and
PharmaKinetics  Laboratories,  Inc., a Maryland  corporation  (&#147;PKLB&#148;)
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger  Agreement&#148;)
which provides for,  subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein,  the
Merger of PKLB and Acquisition (the &#147;Merger&#148;). </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
On July 24, 2002, the Company, Acquisition and PKLB executed an amendment to the
Merger  Agreement.  The  amendment  revised the  exchange  terms for the Class A
Preferred  shares  of PKLB to a set  amount  of $6.00  per  share  for  clarity,
provided  for the  conversion  of an  outstanding  warrant to a warrant  for the
purchase of common shares of the Company which had not been addressed, and added
as a  condition  to the  Merger  that  shareholders  holding  10% or more of the
outstanding PKLB common shares not exercise  dissenters&#146;  appraisal rights.
</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Between  June and August 2002,  the Company  loaned PKLB a total of $350,000 for
working  capital  purposes.  On  November  14,  2002,  PKLB  executed  a Secured
Convertible  Revolving Note in the principal amount of up to $925,000 payable to
the Company to replace the  existing  notes  payable to the Company and to allow
PKLB to borrow  additional  amounts to cover short-term  operating  requirements
(the  &#147;Note&#148;).  The Note  issued  to the  Company  carries  an  annual
interest rate of 8%, and all  principal and accrued  interest is due and payable
on May 1, 2003. The outstanding  principal  amount of the Note is convertible by
the Company at any time into PKLB common  stock at a price of $0.1585 per common
share,  which price represents the average of the closing prices for PKLB&#146;s
common  shares as  reported  by Nasdaq for the twenty  (20)  trading  days ended
November 8, 2002.  The Note to the Company is secured by a security  interest in
favor  of the  Company  in all of the  assets  of PKLB  pursuant  to a  Security
Agreement  between  PKLB,  as debtor,  and the  Company as secured  party.  PKLB
Limited Partnership,  a subsidiary of PKLB, guaranteed the repayment of the Note
to the Company,  pursuant to the terms of an Unconditional  Guaranty dated as of
November 15,  2002,  and pledged the real  property  located at 302 West Fayette
Street, Baltimore, Maryland to the Company as security for its guaranty pursuant
to the terms of an Indemnity Deed of Trust. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
On November  21,  2002,  the  Company,  Acquisition  and PKLB  executed a second
amendment  to the Merger  Agreement.  The second  amendment  revised  the Merger
Agreement  to provide  that all PKLB common  shares held by the Company  will be
canceled  automatically  as of the  effective  time of the  Merger.  The  second
amendment  further amended the Merger Agreement to provide that the Company will
have the right to terminate the Merger Agreement in the event that any holder of
PKLB&#146;s  Class A Preferred shares  exercises its conversion  rights prior to
the effective  time of the Merger.  The second  amendment also extended the date
upon which the parties will have the right to terminate the Merger  Agreement if
the Merger has not been  consummated  from  December 31, 2002 to March 31, 2003.
Finally, the second amendment modified the merger  consideration  payable to the
holders of Class A Preferred  shares by reducing the principal  amount of the 6%
Subordinated Convertible Note due 2008 from $6.00 per Class A Preferred share to
$4.80 per share and modified the form of the 6%  Subordinated  Convertible  Note
due  2008  to  insert   certain   subordination   provisions   required  by  the
Company&#146;s lender. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The board of directors of PKLB has  unanimously  approved the Merger  Agreement.
Each holder of PKLB common  shares  (other than the Company) will be entitled to
receive  one-twelfth (1/12) of one common share of the Company for each of their
PKLB  common  shares.  Each  holder of PKLB  Class A  Preferred  shares  will be
entitled to receive a 6%  Subordinated  Convertible  Note due 2009 issued by the
Company with a principal  amount equal to $4.80 per Class A Preferred share. The
notes are  convertible  into common  shares of the Company at any time after one
year after the date of issuance at a price of $16.00 per share.  The sole holder
of PKLB Class B Preferred shares will be entitled to receive  one-twelfth (1/12)
of one common  share of the Company  for each PKLB  common  share into which its
Class B  Preferred  shares  are  convertible.  Each Class B  Preferred  share is
convertible  into 1.00062 PKLB common shares.  In addition,  the warrant held by
the holder of the Class B  Preferred  shares to  purchase  100,000  PKLB  common
shares at a price of $6.00 per share will be exchanged for a warrant to purchase
8,333 BAS common shares at a price of $72.00 per share. As of the effective time
of the Merger, all PKLB common shares held by the Company will be cancelled. The
transaction  is subject to approval by the  Company&#146;s  board and  customary
closing conditions,  including registration of the Company&#146;s  securities to
be issued in the Merger and the approval of PKLB&#146;s shareholders. The Merger
is currently expected to close prior to March 31, 2003. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Holders of more than 85% of the Class A  Preferred  shares  have  agreed to vote
those  shares in favor of the  approval of the Merger and the Merger  Agreement.
The sole holder of the Class B Preferred  shares has advised the Company that it
intends to vote its shares in favor of the approval of the Merger and the Merger
Agreement.  Prior to the record date of the special meeting of the  shareholders
of PKLB, the Company intends to convert the  outstanding  balance under the Note
into  common  shares of PKLB.  Assuming  that the entire  balance of $925,000 is
outstanding as of the record date (without  accounting for any interest that may
also be outstanding),  BAS will own 5,836,962 common shares of PKLB. The Company
intends to vote all of these  shares in favor of  approval of the Merger and the
Merger  Agreement.  The votes  described in this  paragraph  are  sufficient  to
approve the Merger and the Merger Agreement under Maryland law. </FONT></P>

through the purchase by the Company of all of the outstanding  shares of LCR for
$2.5 million, subject to adjustment as described below. The Company paid cash of
$125,000 at closing. In addition,  the Company also delivered  $2,250,000 of the
purchase  price at the  closing  in the form of  promissory  notes  maturing  on
October 1, 2007 and bearing  interest at a rate of 10% per annum. The holders of
the notes will have the option to require  the Company to repay up to 20% of the
outstanding  principal balance of the notes on each October 1 prior to maturity,
commencing  October 1, 2003. The amount of the purchase price may be adjusted as
a result of certain  changes in the net tangible assets of LCR as of the closing
date.  The Company has 90 days from the closing date to determine  the amount of
the adjustment.  Finally,  the Company will pay an additional $125,000 either in
cash or by  increasing  the  principal  amount of the  promissory  notes,  to be
determined by the mutual  agreement of the parties when the net tangible  assets
of LCR are determined. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Certain  assets  comprising  separate  lines of  business of LCR were sold to an
unrelated third party prior to the closing of the purchase by the Company of the
outstanding shares of LCR, and the proceeds of that sale were distributed to the
LCR shareholders. </FONT></P>

Changing Nature of the Pharmaceutical Industry</FONT></H2>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The Company provides research services and products globally. The Company&#146;s
services and products are marketed to pharmaceutical, medical device and biotech
companies engaged in drug development.  The research services industry is highly
fragmented  among  hundreds  of  niche  vendors  and a small  number  of  larger
companies;  the  latter  offer  an  ever-growing  portfolio  of  cradle-to-grave
pharmaceutical  development  services.  The  Company&#146;s  products  are  also
marketed to academic and government  institutions.  The Company&#146;s  services
and products may have distinctly  different  customers (often separate divisions
in a single large pharmaceutical company) and requirements. It believes that all
clients are facing increased  pressure to outsource facets of their research and
development  activities  and that the  following  factors will  increase  client
outsourcing: </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><I>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accelerated Drug Development</I><br>
End users continue to demand faster, more efficient,  more selective development
of a larger pool of drug  candidates.  Clients demand fast, high quality service
in order to make  immediate,  well  informed  decisions to quickly  exclude poor
candidates  and speed  development  of successful  ones. The need for additional
development  capacity to exploit  more  opportunities,  accelerate  development,
extend  market  exclusivity  and  increase  profitability  drives the demand for
outsourced services. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><I>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Cost      Containment</i><br>
Pharmaceutical  companies  continue  to push for more  efficient  operations  to
optimize  profitability  as  development  costs  escalate,  generic  competition
challenges  previously  secure  profit  generators,  and  political  and  social
pressures mount to reduce health care costs. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><I>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patent     Expiration</i><br>
As exclusivity ends with patent expiry,  drug companies defend their proprietary
positions against generic  competition with various patent extension  strategies
(reformulation, drug combinations, chiral forms). Both the parent creating these
line extensions and the generic competitors will outsource development.
</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><I>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alliances</I><br>
Strategic  alliances allow  pharmaceutical  companies to share research know-how
and to develop and market new drugs faster in more diverse,  global markets. The
Company believes that alliances will lead to a greater number of potential drugs
in  testing,  many  under  study  by small  companies  lacking  broad  technical
resources. Those small companies add shareholder value by further developing new
products through outsourcing, reducing risk for potential allies. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><I>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mergers and Acquisitions</I><br>
Consolidation  in the  pharmaceutical  industry is  commonplace.  As firms blend
personnel,  resources and business  activities,  the Company  believes they will
continue to streamline  operations,  minimizing staffing which will lead to more
outsourcing.  This may  result in  short-term  disruption  in  placement  of, or
progress on, drug development  programs as merging  companies  rationalize their
respective pipelines. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><I>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biotechnology Industry and Virtual Drug Company Growth</I><br>
The biotech industry continues to grow and has introduced many new developmental
drugs.  Developers  do not  have  in-house  resources  to  conduct  development.
Strategically,  many new companies choose only to develop a product sufficiently
to attract a partner  who will  manufacture  and market the drug.  Many of these
virtual development companies will outsource drug development. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><I>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unique Technical Expertise</I><br>
The increasing  complexity of new drugs requires highly specialized  quality and
innovative,  solution-driven  research not  available  in all client  labs.  The
Company believes that this need for unique technical expertise will increasingly
lead to outsourcing of research activity. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><I>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Management Expertise</I><br>
The FDA is requiring more regulatory data and greater access to that data and is
encouraging use of computer-assisted  filings in an effort to expedite approval.
The Company is able to provide  clients with remote  access to Company  computer
systems while at the same time protecting client data from unauthorized  access.
The Company has also developed  proprietary validated online data entry software
enabling direct publication of data in unique client formats. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalization of the Marketplace</I><br>
Foreign firms are relying on independent  development  companies with experience
in the  United  States to  provide  integrated  services  through  all phases of
product  development and to assist in preparing complex regulatory  submissions.
Domestic drug firms are  broadening  product  availability  globally,  demanding
local regulatory approval.  The Company believes that domestic service providers
with  global  reach,  established  regulatory  expertise,  and a broad  range of
integrated  development services will benefit from this trend. The Company has a
significant  European  presence  and  domestic  skills  in  foreign  operations.

The Company&#146;s Role in the Drug Development Process</FONT></H2>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
After a new drug candidate is created and carried through preliminary screening,
the development process for new drugs has three distinct phases. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
<B>1)</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  <B><I>preclinical  phase</I></B> includes safety
testing to prepare an Investigational New Drug  (&#147;IND&#148;)  exemption for
submission to the FDA (Food and Drug  Administration).  The IND must be accepted
by the FDA  before the drug can be tested in  humans.  Once a  pharmacologically
active  molecule is fully analyzed to confirm its integrity,  the initial dosage
form for clinical trials is created. An analytical chemistry method is developed
to  enable  reliable  quantification.  Stability  of  the  formulation  is  also
determined. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Clients work with the  Company&#146;s  preclinical  services  group to establish
pharmacokinetics  and safety testing of the new drug. These safety studies range
from acute safety monitoring on drugs and medical devices to chronic, multi-year
oncogenicity studies.  Bioanalyses of blood sampled under these protocols by the
Company&#146;s bioanalytical services group provide kinetic, metabolism and dose
ranging data. Upon successful  completion of preclinical safety studies,  an IND
submission  is  prepared  and  provided  to the FDA for  review  prior  to human
clinical trials. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Many  of the  Company&#146;s  products  are  designed  for  use  in  preclinical
development.  The Culex<SUP>&#174;</SUP> ABS, a robotic automated blood sampler,
enables  researchers to develop  pharmacokinetic  profiles of drugs during early
screening in rodents quickly and cost  effectively.  Several  variations of this
technology  are in  development.  Clients and the  Company&#146;s  bioanalytical
services  group  used the  Company&#146;s  electrochemistry  and  chromatography
products  to  develop a single,  quick,  proprietary  method to screen  drugs in
biological samples. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
<B>2)</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The   second  <B><I>clinical   phase</I></B>  further
explores  the safety and  efficacy  of the  substance  in  humans.  The  sponsor
conducts  Phase  I  human  clinical  trials  in  a  limited  number  of  healthy
individuals to determine safety and tolerability. Bioanalytical assays determine
the   availability   and   metabolism   of  the  active   ingredient   following
administration.  Expertise in method  development  and  validation is essential,
particularly for new chemical entities. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
More exhaustive  safety,  tolerability and dosing regimens have been established
in sick humans in Phase II trials.  Phase III clinical  trials are  conducted to
verify efficacy and safety.  After  successful  completion of Phase III clinical
trials,   the  sponsor  of  the  new  drug   submits  a  New  Drug   Application
(&#147;NDA&#148;)  or Product License Application  (&#147;PLA&#148;)  to the FDA
requesting  that the  product be approved  for  marketing.  Early  manufacturing
demonstrates  production of the substance in accordance with the FDA&#146;s cGMP
guidelines.  Data  from  these  activities  are  compiled  in  an  NDA,  or  for
biotechnology  products a PLA, for submission to the FDA requesting  approval to
market the drug or product.  The  Company&#146;s  bioanalytical work per patient
grows  rapidly  from Phase I through  III.  The number of  samples  per  patient
declines  as the number of  patients  grows in later  studies.  Phase II and III
studies take several years,  practicing well-proven analytical protocols.  It is
unusual for a sponsor to change  laboratories  unless  there are problems in the
quality or timely delivery of results. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
<B>3)</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Post-approval</I></B>, the third phase, follows
FDA  approval  of  the  NDA or  PLA.  This  includes  production  and  continued
analytical  and clinical  monitoring of the drug. The  post-approval  phase also
involves the development and regulatory  approval of product  modifications  and
line extensions,  including improved dosage forms.  Following approval, the drug
manufacturer must comply with quality assurance and quality control requirements
throughout  production and must continue analytical and stability studies of the
drug during  commercial  production in order to continue to validate  production
processes and confirm product shelf life.  Samples from each manufactured  batch
must be tested prior to release of the batch for distribution to the public. The
Company  also  provides  services in all areas during the  post-approval  phase,
concentrating on bio-equivalence  studies of new formulations,  line extensions,
new disease indications and drug interaction studies. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview</I><br>
The Company operates in two principal  segments &#150;  analytical  services and
analytical products, both of which are aimed at addressing the bioanalytical and
preclinical  research needs of drug  developers.  Both segments arose out of the
Company&#146;s  expertise  in a  number  of  core  technologies,  out  of  which
state-of-the-art  equipment and procedures  designed to quantify trace chemicals
in complex  materials were  developed.  The Company  evaluates  performance  and
allocates resources based on these segments. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The Pharmaceutical  Research and Manufacturing  Association  (&#147;PhRMA&#148;)
states that  pharmaceutical  and  biotechnology  companies  spent $30.3  billion
worldwide on research and development in 2001. Analysts estimate that outsourced
research and development services will grow from $5 billion in 2000 to more than
$9 billion by 2004. The Company  believes this growing trend toward  outsourcing
will continue. </FONT></P>

Over the past five years, the Company has regularly provided its services and/or
products to most of the top 25 pharmaceutical  companies in the world, as ranked
by 2001 research and development spending.  The Company has been recognized as a
preferred vendor, or a tactical partner, to four of these firms. Since 2000, the
Company has been concentrating its business  development effort on the next tier
of smaller drug  development  companies.  The Company believes that companies of
this size are less likely to have resources comparable to the Company&#146;s and
will  consequently  be more  inclined  to  establish  a  consistent,  long-term,
strategic  relationship  with the  Company.  The Company  also  recognizes  that
increasing  its  dependence  on a larger  pool of  smaller  companies  demands a
broader,  more active and more fragmented  business  development effort, and the
Company has adapted accordingly. </FONT></P>

Approximately  24% of the  Company&#146;s  products  and  services  revenues are
generated from customers outside the United States.  During 2002, 2001 and 2000,
Pfizer accounted for approximately 19.0%, 18.9% and 21.0%, respectively,  of the
Company&#146;s  total  revenue  and  15.7%  and  23.6% of total  trade  accounts
receivable at September 30, 2002 and 2001,  respectively.  During 2002, 2001 and
2000, Pharmacia accounted for approximately 9.3%, 11.7% and 12.2%, respectively,
of the Company&#146;s total revenues, and 6.3% and 10.7% of total trade accounts
receivable at September 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2002, Pfizer and
Pharmacia  announced their intention to merge,  but to date, this merger has not
affected the Company&#146;s relationship with these former customers who now are
a single customer.  There can be no assurance that the  Company&#146;s  business
will not continue to be dependent on continued  relationships  with the combined
Pfizer/Pharmacia  or other clients or, that annual results will not be dependent
on the  performance  of a few  large  projects.  In  addition,  there  can be no
assurance  that  significant  clients  in any one  period  will  continue  to be
significant  clients in other periods. In any given year, there is a possibility
that  a  single  pharmaceutical  company  may  account  for  5% or  more  of the
Company&#146;s total revenue. Furthermore,  since the Company does not have long
term  contracts  with its clients,  the  importance  of a single client may vary
dramatically from year to year. </FONT></P>

Contractual Arrangements</FONT></H2>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The Company&#146;s  service contracts typically establish an estimated fee to be
paid for identified  services.  In most cases,  some  percentage of the contract
costs is paid in advance.  While the Company is  performing a contract,  clients
often  adjust the scope of  services  to be  provided  by the  Company  based on
interim  project  results.  Fees  are  adjusted  accordingly.   Generally,   the
Company&#146;s  fee-for-service  contracts  are  terminable  by the client  upon
written  notice  of 30 days or less for a  variety  of  reasons,  including  the
client&#146;s  decision  to forego a  particular  study,  the failure of product
prototypes to satisfy safety  requirements,  and unexpected or undesired results
of product testing. </FONT></P>

Backlog</FONT></H2>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Considering  that the  arrangements  pursuant to which the Company  provides its
services are terminable upon written notice of 30 days or less, the Company does
not disclose  backlog for the services it  provides.  The Company does  maintain
projections  based  on  bids  and  contracts  to  optimize  asset   utilization.
</FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Competition</FONT></H2>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
With respect to its  services,  the Company  competes  primarily  with  in-house
research, development,  quality control and other support service departments of
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. There are also full-service Contract
Research  Organizations  (&#147;CROs&#148;)  that compete in this industry.  The
largest CRO competitors  offering  similar  research  services  include Covance,
Inc.,  Pharmaceutical Product Development,  Inc., AAIpharma, Inc. and MDS Health
Group Ltd. CROs generally compete on the basis of previous  experience,  medical
and  scientific  expertise in specific  therapeutic  areas,  quality of contract
research,  ability to organize and manage  large-scale trials on a global basis,
medical database  management  capabilities,  ability to provide  statistical and
regulatory  services,  ability to recruit  investigators,  ability to  integrate
information  technology  with  systems to improve  the  efficiency  of  contract
research,  existence of an  international  presence with  strategically  located
facilities, financial viability and price. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
With respect to its products,  the Company competes with several large equipment
manufacturers,   including   Agilent,   Waters   Corporation  and  Perkin  Elmer
Corporation.  Competitive  factors  include market  presence,  product  quality,
reliability  and price.  The  Company  believes  it  competes  well in its niche
markets because of its reputation and the quality of its products, together with
the technical assistance and service it offers. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Many  of the  Company&#146;s  competitors  are  much  larger  and  have  greater
resources than the Company,  which makes it difficult for the Company to capture
business  from  clients  other  than  those who need the  Company&#146;s  unique
capabilities. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Government Regulation</FONT></H2>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The Company is subject to various regulatory requirements designed to ensure the
quality and integrity of its data and products.  These  regulations are governed
primarily  under  the  Federal  Food,  Drug  and  Cosmetic  Act,  as  well as by
associated Good Laboratory  Practice  (&#147;GLP&#148;)  and Good  Manufacturing
Practice (&#147;GMP&#148;)  guidelines administered by the FDA. The standards of
GLP and GMP are required by the FDA and by similar regulatory authorities around
the world.  These  guidelines  demand rigorous  attention to employee  training;
detailed,  authorized documentation;  equipment validation;  careful tracking of
changes and routine auditing of compliance.  Noncompliance  with these standards
could  result in  disqualification  of project  data  collected  by the Company.
Material  violation  of  GLP  or  GMP  guidelines  could  result  in  additional
regulatory sanctions and, in severe cases, could also result in a discontinuance
of selected Company operations. </FONT></P>

Laboratories  such as ours that  provide  information  that is included in INDs,
NDAs and PLAs must  conform to  regulatory  requirements  that are  designed  to
ensure  the  quality  and  integrity  of  the  testing  process.   Most  of  the
Company&#146;s  contract research  services are subject to government  standards
for  laboratory  practices  that are embodied in guidelines for GLP. The FDA and
other  regulatory  authorities  require  that  test  results  submitted  to such
authorities  be based  on  studies  conducted  in  accordance  with  GLP.  These
guidelines are set out to help the researcher  perform work in compliance with a
pre-established plan and standardized  procedures.  These guidelines include but

The Company&#146;s  animal research  facilities are also subject to a variety of
federal and state laws and regulations, including The Animal Welfare Act and the
rules and regulations  promulgated thereunder by the United States Department of
Agriculture  (&#147;USDA&#148;).  These regulations  establish the standards for
the humane  treatment,  care and  handling  of animals by dealers  and  research
facilities.  The  Company&#146;s  animal research  facilities  maintain detailed
standard  operating  procedures and the  documentation  necessary to comply with
applicable  regulations for the humane  treatment of the animals in its custody.
Besides being licensed by the USDA as a research facility, this business is also
accredited by the  Association  for Assessment and  Accreditation  of Laboratory
Animal Care  International  and has registered  assurance with the United States
National Institutes of Health Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
To  help  assure  compliance  with  applicable  regulations,   the  Company  has
established  quality assurance  programs at its facilities that audit test data,
train  personnel and review  procedures  and regularly  inspect  facilities.  In
addition, FDA regulations and guidelines serve as a basis for the Company&#146;s
standard operating procedures where applicable. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Some of the Company&#146;s development and testing activities are subject to the
Controlled   Substances  Act  administered  by  the  Drug   Enforcement   Agency
(&#147;DEA&#148;),  which  strictly  regulates  all narcotic  and  habit-forming
substances.  The Company maintains  restricted-access  facilities and heightened
control  procedures for projects  involving such  substances due to the level of
security and other  controls  required by the DEA. In  addition,  the Company is
subject  to other  federal  and state  regulations  concerning  such  matters as
occupational safety and health and protection of the environment. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The  Company&#146;s  activities  also  involve the  controlled  use of hazardous
materials and chemicals.  The Company is subject to foreign,  federal, state and
local laws and regulations governing the use, storage,  handling and disposal of
such materials and certain waste  products,  as well as the safety and health of
laboratory employees. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Our United States  laboratories  are subject to licensing and  regulation  under
federal,  state and local laws  relating to hazard  communication  and  employee
right-to-know  regulations,  the handling and disposal of medical  specimens and
hazardous waste, as well as the safety and health of laboratory  employees.  All
of our  laboratories  are  subject  to  applicable  federal  and state  laws and
regulations  relating to the storage and  disposal of all  laboratory  specimens
including the regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department
of  Transportation,  the  National  Fire  Protection  Agency  and  the  Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act. Although we believe that the Company is currently
in compliance in all material respects with such federal,  state and local laws,
failure to comply  could  subject  the Company to denial of the right to conduct
business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions. </FONT></P>

In addition to its  comprehensive  regulation  of safety in the  workplace,  the
Occupational  Safety  and  Health   Administration  has  established   extensive
requirements  relating  to  workplace  safety for health  care  employers  whose
workers may be exposed to blood-borne  pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B
virus.  These regulations,  among other things,  require work practice controls,
protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and
other measures designed to minimize  exposure to chemicals,  and transmission of
blood-borne  and  airborne  pathogens.  Furthermore,  relevant  employees of the
Company  receive  initial and  periodic  training  focusing on  compliance  with
applicable  hazardous  materials  regulations and health and safety  guidelines.

The  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  recently   promulgated  final
regulations  under the Health Insurance  Portability and  Accountability  Act of
1996 (&#147;HIPAA&#148;) that will govern the disclosure of confidential medical
information in the United States.  The Privacy Rule, which governs disclosure of
confidential  information,  was  effective  beginning  April 14,  2001,  and all
companies  subject to the Privacy  Rule must comply  with its  provisions  on or
before  April 14,  2003.  We have had a global  privacy  policy  in place  since
January 2001, which includes a designated  privacy officer,  and believe that we
are in compliance with the current EU (European  Union) and HIPAA  requirements.
Nevertheless,  we will  continue  to  monitor  our  compliance  with  these  new
regulations and will take  appropriate  steps to ensure  compliance as these and
other privacy regulations come into effect. </FONT></P>

Product Liability and Insurance</FONT></H2>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The Company maintains  product  liability and professional  errors and omissions
liability  insurance,  providing  approximately  $6.0  million in  coverage on a
claims-made basis.  Additionally,  in certain circumstances the Company seeks to
manage its liability risk through contractual  provisions with clients requiring
the Company to be indemnified by the client or covered by clients&#146;  product
liability insurance policies.  Also, in certain types of engagements the Company
seeks to limit  its  contractual  liability  to  clients  to the  amount of fees
received by the Company. The contractual arrangements are subject to negotiation
with  clients,  and the  terms  and  scope  of such  indemnification,  liability
limitation and insurance coverage vary by client and project. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Research and Development</FONT></H2>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
In fiscal year 2002, the Company spent  $1,521,000 on research and  development.
Separate  from the  Company&#146;s  contract  research  services  business,  the
Company maintains  applications research and development to enhance its products
business. Expenditures cover hardware and software engineering costs, laboratory
supplies, animals,  drugs/reagents,  labor, prototype development and laboratory
demonstrations of new products and applications for those products. Hardware and
software  engineering  and  prototype  development  in 2002  generated  multiple
Culex&#174;-related  products (Bambino System, Raturn upgrade,  Vertical Sensor,
Metabolic Cage for Mice,  Empis  Automated  Infusion  System) and new techniques
which  can  be  offered  as  contract  services  (lung   microdialysis,   rodent
electrocardiography).  Laboratory  demonstrations are published in peer-reviewed
journals,   scientific  seminars  or  at  scientific   association  meetings  as
promotional tools for existing and new products.  Culex<SUP>&#174;</SUP>-related
products and demonstrations consumed roughly 80% of all research and development
dollars in 2002. The Company also makes small expenditures in novel research and
development,  some under partial grants,  such as its membership in the National
Institutes of Health  (&#147;NIH&#148;)  supported Botanicals Center with Purdue
University,  Indiana  University,  and the University of Alabama.  The Center is
focused on applying strict FDA safety and efficacy  guidelines to  plant-derived
chemicals  that are  claimed  to have  therapeutic  properties.  Seven  NIH SBIR
research grant  applications were filed in 2002 to support  development of other
products under consideration. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Intellectual Property</FONT></H2>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The  Company  believes  that  its  patents,  trademarks,  copyrights  and  other
proprietary rights are important to its business and,  accordingly,  it actively
seeks  protection  for those rights both in the United States and abroad.  Where
the Company deems it to be an appropriate  course of action,  it will vigorously
prosecute patent infringements.  The Company does not believe, however, that the
loss of any one of its  patents,  trademarks,  copyrights  or other  proprietary
rights would be material to its consolidated revenues or earnings. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The  Company  currently  holds  seven  registered  trademarks  and  one  pending
trademark, as well as one copyright.  The Company also maintains a small pool of
issued  and  pending  patents.   Most  of  these  patents  are  related  to  the
Company&#146;s Culex<SUP>&#174;</SUP> or in vivo product line. Of these patents,
most are either issued or pending in the United States,  although there are also
patents  pending in the European  Union,  Japan and with the World  Intellectual
Property Organization.  Although the Company believes that at least two of these
patents are important to the <SUP>Culex&#174;</SUP> product line, the success of
the  Culex<SUP>&#174;</SUP>  business  is not  dependent  on the  Company&#146;s
intellectual  property  rights because the Company also  generates  client value
through  continuing  client  support,  hardware  and software  upgrades,  system
reliability and accuracy. </FONT></P>

In  addition,  the Company  relies on trade  secrets,  unpatented  know-how  and
continuing  applications  research  which it seeks to protect  through  means of
reasonable business procedures,  such as confidentiality agreements. The Company
believes  that the greatest  value that it generates  for its clients comes from
these trade secrets, know-how and applications research. </FONT></P>

Raw Materials</FONT></H2>

Employees</FONT></H2>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
At September  30, 2002,  the Company had 267 full-time  employees,  163 of which
hold college  degrees,  including 41 at the doctoral level.  All employees enter
into   confidentiality   agreements   intended  to  protect  the  Company&#146;s
proprietary  information.  The  Company  believes  that its  relations  with its
employees are good.  None of the  Company&#146;s  employees are represented by a
labor union. The  Company&#146;s  performance  depends on its ability to attract
and retain qualified professional,  scientific and technical staff. The level of
competition  among employers for skilled personnel is high. The Company believes
that its employee benefit plans enhance employee morale, professional commitment
and work  productivity and provide an incentive for employees to remain with the
Company. </FONT></P>

Item 7A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk</FONT></H2>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The  Company&#146;s  primary  market  risk  exposure  with  regard to  financial
instruments is the changes in interest rates. The Credit  Agreement  between the
Company and The Provident  Bank dated October 29, 2002 bears  interest at a rate
of either the  bank&#146;s  prime rate plus 0 to 125 basis  points,  or at LIBOR
plus 200 to 350  basis  points,  depending  in each  case  upon the ratio of the
Company&#146;s interest-bearing indebtedness (less subordinated debt) to EBITDA,
at the Company&#146;s option. Historically,  the Company has not used derivative
financial  instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes.  The Company
estimates  that a  hypothetical  10% adverse  change in interest rates would not
affect the consolidated  operating  results of the Company by a material amount.
</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The Company operates  internationally and is, therefore,  subject to potentially
adverse  movements in foreign currency rates change.  The effect of movements in
the exchange rates was not material to the consolidated operating results of the
Company in fiscal years 2002 and 2001. The Company estimates that a hypothetical
10%  adverse  change in foreign  currency  exchange  rates  would not affect the
consolidated operating results of the Company by a material amount. </FONT></P>
