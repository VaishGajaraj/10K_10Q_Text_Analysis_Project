</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE Group Ltd. is an insurance holding company organized in Bermuda. We provide reinsurance
products and services to a worldwide marketplace through our wholly owned subsidiary operations
located in Bermuda, Europe and the United States. Our primary business has been catastrophe and
risk excess reinsurance, which accounted for substantially all of our net premiums written for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;16, 2006, we announced that we would be increasing our estimates of the net
pre-tax impact of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma on our results of operations for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2005. We also announced our intention to explore strategic alternatives due to
concerns about the hurricane losses and the resulting potential negative impact on our credit
ratings. Following these announcements, in February&nbsp;2006 our counterparty

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">credit and financial strength ratings were downgraded by the major rating agencies to a level
that was unacceptable to many of our reinsurance clients. These ratings downgrades have had a
significant negative impact on our results of operations and profitability because they have
impaired our ability to retain and renew our existing reinsurance business. In light of the
negative consequences of rating downgrades, our Board of Directors determined that we should
evaluate strategic alternatives to our operating approach at that time and decided to retain Lazard
Fr&#232;res &#038; Co. LLC (&#147;Lazard&#148;) (which has since been succeeded by Keefe, Bruyette &#038; Woods, Inc.
(&#147;KBW&#148;)) as a financial advisor to assist in the strategic exploration process.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the downgrade and withdrawal of our credit ratings in early 2006, we have not
underwritten any material new reinsurance contracts or renewed any of our expiring reinsurance
contracts. During 2006, most of our clients exercised their contractual rights to terminate their
reinsurance contracts with us as a result of the decline in our ratings and capital. In order to
manage our peak zone catastrophe exposures, the Company had also selectively allowed
extra-contractual cancellations on certain contracts that do not contain cancellation provisions
triggered by rating downgrades. As of January&nbsp;1, 2007, virtually all of our in-force assumed
reinsurance contracts had expired and we have no remaining material exposure to future catastrophe
events at that date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had net income before convertible preferred share dividends of $28.5&nbsp;million in 2006
compared to a net loss before convertible preferred share dividends of $697.6&nbsp;million in 2005. The
primary cause of the 2005 net loss was the net impact of catastrophe losses arising from Hurricanes
Katrina, Rita and Wilma of $806.9&nbsp;million, after reinsurance recoveries on our outwards reinsurance
program and the impact of inwards and outwards reinstatements and additional premiums. The Company
had $84.5&nbsp;million in net premiums earned during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, as compared to
$388.3&nbsp;million in the prior year.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
March 14, 2007, the Board of Directors concluded its strategic alternative evaluation
process and announced that we had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger
Agreement&#148;) with Argonaut Group, Inc. (&#147;Argonaut&#148;). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
Argonaut will merge into a newly formed PXRE Group Ltd. subsidiary, PXMS, Inc. Upon completion of
the merger, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement which has been
unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both companies, Argonaut stockholders will
receive subject to certain adjustments 6.4672 PXRE common shares in exchange for each share of Argonaut common stock. Upon
closing of the transaction, approximately 73% of PXRE&#146;s outstanding common shares will be owned
by former Argonaut stockholders, and approximately 27% by former holders of PXRE&#146;s common shares
and convertible voting preferred shares. Argonaut stock options and other equity awards will
automatically convert upon completion of the merger into stock options and equity awards with
respect to PXRE common stock, subject to adjustment to reflect the exchange ratio.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon completion of the merger, PXRE will be renamed &#147;Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd.&#148;
and its common shares will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and relisted on the NASDAQ
Global Market (&#147;NASDAQ&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completion of the merger, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2007, is subject
to various conditions, including (1)&nbsp;receipt of approvals of the holders of PXRE and Argonaut
common stock, (2)&nbsp;receipt of regulatory approvals, and (3)&nbsp;effectiveness of the Form S-4
registration statement relating to the PXRE common stock to be issued in the merger and (4)&nbsp;listing
of the PXRE common stock on the NASDAQ.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and Argonaut. Under
certain circumstances, including those relating to competing business combination proposals,
termination of the merger agreement could obligate PXRE to pay a termination fee of $20&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Argonaut underwrites specialty commercial insurance in niche areas of the property and
casualty insurance market. Argonaut offers property and casualty insurance products through eleven
wholly-owned insurance companies. Collectively, the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to write
insurance in all fifty states and in the District of Columbia, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands and
are authorized to write insurance on a surplus lines basis in all fifty states.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Argonaut targets niches in which it can develop a leadership position and which Argonaut
believes will generate underwriting profits. Argonaut has stated that its growth has been achieved
both organically through an operational strategy focused on underwriting discipline and as a result
of acquisition activity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently with the announcement of the merger, we also announced the formation of a new
Bermuda based reinsurance subsidiary, Peleus Reinsurance Ltd. (&#147;Peleus Re&#148;).
Peleus Re has been rated &#147;A-&#148; by A.M. Best &#038; Company (&#147;A.M. Best&#148;) and is expected to begin writing
reinsurance business. Peleus Re will focus on underwriting medium to small commercial property
reinsurance risks on a pro rata and risk excess basis, and property catastrophe reinsurance risk on
a controlled basis. It is also expected to reinsure casualty risks; initially through a quota
share of Argonaut&#146;s existing casualty business. Peleus Re will initially be capitalized with $213
million contributed from the existing surplus of PXRE Bermuda. PXRE Bermuda and PXRE Reinsurance
will be placed into an orderly runoff, but will provide intercompany reinsurance support to Peleus
Re.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors believes that the merger with Argonaut and resumption of reinsurance
business through Peleus Re will provide shareholders with an expected return that is superior to
both the potential value that shareholders would have realized if the Board of Directors had
elected to pursue other non-runoff alternatives considered during the strategic evaluation process
or the potential value that shareholders were likely to realize if the Company were to be
liquidated after the conclusion of an orderly runoff and winding up process.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately following our February&nbsp;16, 2006 announcement, Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s Ratings Services
(&#147;S&#038;P&#148;), a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies,
Inc., downgraded its counterparty credit and financial strength rating on PXRE Reinsurance and PXRE Bermuda from &#147;A-&#148; to &#147;BBB&#043;&#148;
and placed these ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. A.M. Best, an independent
insurance industry rating organization, also downgraded its financial strength rating from &#147;A-&#148; to
&#147;B&#043;&#043;&#148; with a negative outlook. On February&nbsp;17, 2006, Moody&#146;s Investor Services (&#147;Moody&#146;s&#148;)
downgraded its insurance financial strength rating of PXRE Reinsurance from &#147;Baa1&#148; to &#147;Baa2&#148; and
placed this rating under review for possible further downgrade.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;22, 2006, we announced our financial results for the quarter ended December&nbsp;31,
2005. We also announced a further increase in our estimates of the net pre-tax impact of
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. <I>See Item&nbsp;7 &#150; Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations &#150; Comparison of 2005 with 2004 &#150; Losses and Loss Expenses.</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently in February, 2006, S&#038;P further downgraded its counterparty credit and financial
strength rating on PXRE Reinsurance and PXRE Bermuda from &#147;BBB&#043;&#148; to &#147;BBB-&#148;, and A.M. Best further
downgraded its financial strength rating on these entities from &#147;B&#043;&#043;&#148; to &#147;B&#043;&#148; with a negative
implication. Moody&#146;s further downgraded its insurance financial strength rating of PXRE
Reinsurance from &#147;Baa2&#148; to &#147;Baa3&#148; and placed this rating under review for possible further
downgrade. <I>See Item&nbsp;1 &#150; Business: Ratings.</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April, 2006, after finding that operational ratings below the critical &#147;A&#148; category
provided little value for a reinsurer, we announced that we had requested that the major credit
rating agencies withdraw their financial strength and claims paying ratings of the Company and its
operating subsidiaries. In the wake of this request, A.M. Best downgraded its financial strength
ratings of PXRE Reinsurance and PXRE Bermuda from &#147;B&#043;&#148; to &#147;B&#148; and withdrew these ratings; S&#038;P
downgraded its counterparty credit and financial strength rating on PXRE Reinsurance and PXRE
Bermuda from &#147;BBB-&#148; to &#147;BB&#043;&#148; and then withdrew these ratings; and Moody&#146;s downgraded its insurance
financial strength rating of PXRE Reinsurance from &#147;Baa3&#148; to &#147;Ba2&#148; and then withdrew this rating.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position
of reinsurance companies. Due to these ratings downgrades and withdrawal in 2006 of the
operational ratings of our reinsurance subsidiaries by A.M. Best, S&#038;P and Moody&#146;s, our competitive
position in the reinsurance industry has suffered, with ceding companies and brokers having moved
business to other reinsurers with higher ratings. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, virtually all of the
Company&#146;s reinsurance contracts had either been cancelled, non-renewed or expired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
March 15, 2007, Peleus Re received a rating of &#147;A-&#148; from A.M. Best. Our existing
reinsurance subsidiaries, PXRE Bermuda and PXRE Reinsurance were also re-rated &#147;B&#043;&#148; by A.M. Best on
March 15, 2007.

Argonaut&#146;s business, see Argonaut&#146;s Annual Report of Form 10-K for the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, which

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our catastrophe and risk excess business included property catastrophe excess of loss,
property pro-rata, property catastrophe retrocessional, property risk excess, and marine excess and
aerospace excess reinsurance products. Catastrophe and risk excess business has been our primary
focus since our predecessor company was formed in 1986. This means that we primarily focused, in
the year 2006 and prior, on providing reinsurance in respect of events which do not tend to occur
frequently, but when they do occur, have the potential to generate a large amount of losses per
occurrence. This focus on high-severity, relatively low frequency lines of business exposed us to
short term volatility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinsurance is a contractual arrangement in which an insurance company, usually referred to as
the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurance company, usually referred to as the ceding
company, against all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under
one or more insurance contracts. Reinsurance can provide a ceding company with several benefits,
including a reduction in net liability on individual or classes of risks, catastrophe protection
from large or multiple losses, assistance in maintaining acceptable financial ratios, and
additional underwriting capacity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two basic types of reinsurance arrangements: treaty and facultative reinsurance.
All of our business was written as treaty reinsurance. In treaty reinsurance, the ceding company
is obligated to cede and the reinsurer is obligated to assume a specified portion of a type or
category of risks insured by the ceding company. Under treaty reinsurance, reinsurers do not
generally separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under their treaties and,
consequently, after a review of the ceding company&#146;s underwriting practices, are largely dependent
on the original risk underwriting decisions made by the ceding company. In facultative
reinsurance, the ceding company cedes and the reinsurer assumes all or part of the risk under a
single insurance contract. Facultative reinsurance is negotiated separately for each insurance
contract that is reinsured. Facultative reinsurance normally is purchased by ceding companies for
individual risks not covered by their reinsurance treaties, for amounts in excess of the dollar
limits of their reinsurance treaties and for unusual risks.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both treaty and facultative reinsurance can be written on either an excess of loss basis or a
pro rata basis. Under excess of loss reinsurance arrangements, the reinsurer indemnifies the
ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses and expenses in excess of a specified
dollar amount, known as the reinsurer&#146;s attachment point, generally subject to a negotiated
reinsurance contract limit. This means that the reinsurer does not begin to pay its client&#146;s
claims until its claims exceed a certain contractually specified amount and its obligation to pay
those claims is limited to a contractually specified aggregate amount. Under pro rata reinsurance
arrangements, the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as the losses and
expenses in an agreed proportion.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pro rata reinsurance, the reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission.
The ceding commission generally is based on the ceding company&#146;s cost of acquiring the business
being reinsured (commissions, premium taxes, assessments and miscellaneous administrative expense).
Premiums paid by the ceding company to a reinsurer for excess of loss reinsurance are not directly proportional to the premiums that the ceding
company receives because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinsurance can be written through intermediaries, generally professional reinsurance brokers,
or directly with ceding companies. From a ceding company&#146;s perspective, both the broker and the
direct distribution channels have advantages and disadvantages. A ceding company&#146;s decision to
select one distribution channel over the other will be influenced by its perception of such
advantages and disadvantages relative to the reinsurance coverage being placed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property catastrophe reinsurance generally covers claims arising from large catastrophes
around the world such as hurricanes, windstorms, hailstorms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,
fires, industrial explosions, freezes, riots, floods and other man-made or natural disasters. In
underwriting our property catastrophe portfolio, we sought to diversify our exposures
geographically and by peril in order to manage the risks assumed and maximize the return on our
portfolio. In 2006, approximately 99% of our property catastrophe reinsurance and retrocessional
products were written on an excess-of-loss basis based on net premiums written. All of our
reinsurance contracts contained aggregate limits on our exposure to losses. For the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2006, approximately 79% of our property catastrophe and risk excess net premiums
written emanated from clients located outside of North America, including clients located in the
United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, Bermuda, Australia and Asia.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We provided property catastrophe products to both insurers and reinsurers. As of December&nbsp;31,
2006, insurance and reinsurance companies comprised approximately 67% and 33%, respectively, of our
total number of clients, based on client count. The reinsurance of a reinsurer or retrocedent is
referred to as retrocessional reinsurance. Retrocessional reinsurance allows a reinsurer to cover
its own risk exposure and can act to reduce net liability on individual or classes of risks,
protect against catastrophic losses and create additional underwriting capacity. Retrocessional
business generally carries substantially higher risk premiums than property catastrophe reinsurance
business. We believe this risk premium is required because retrocessional coverage is
characterized by higher volatility, principally due to the fact that retrocessional contracts
expose a reinsurer to an uncertain level of correlation with other existing reinsurance contracts.
In addition, the information available to retrocessional underwriters concerning the original
primary risk is often less precise than the information received from primary insurers directly.
The lack of precision in the information received from retrocessional clients also increases the
difficulty of estimating losses in the immediate aftermath of a catastrophe event. Moreover,
exposures from retrocessional business can change within a contract term as the underwriters of a
retrocedent alter their book of business after retrocessional coverage has been bound. There are
substantially fewer competitors offering this type of coverage due to the risks entailed in
underwriting retrocessional business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also offered our clients property-per-risk, marine and aerospace reinsurance and
retrocessional products. Unlike property catastrophe reinsurance, which protects against the
accumulation of a large number of related losses arising out of one catastrophe, per-risk excess of
loss reinsurance protects our clients against a large loss arising from a single risk or location.
Substantially all of our property-per-risk was written on an
excess-of-loss basis with contractual aggregate limits on our exposure to losses. Our aerospace reinsurance business included both
excess of loss aviation business and excess of loss and pro rata satellite reinsurance business.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property reinsurance market has historically been a very cyclical market, with pricing
improving significantly in the wake of major insured catastrophe losses. For example, the events
of September&nbsp;11, 2001, combined with industry-wide reserve deficiencies recognized subsequently and
generally poor investment performance of recent years, resulted in increases in pricing in
conjunction with improved terms and conditions for the insurance industry for the underwriting
years 2002 through 2004. As a direct result, we experienced significant rate increases and strong
profitability in our core property catastrophe and risk excess segment, which is reflected in our
results of operations for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2002 and 2003. Operating in this favorable
environment, we had net income before convertible preferred share dividends of $64.5&nbsp;million in
2002 and $96.6&nbsp;million in 2003.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underwriting environment remained favorable in 2004, but our underwriting results were
negatively impacted by losses arising from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne that
occurred during the third quarter of 2004. As a result, net income before convertible preferred
share dividends for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 was $22.8&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, the underwriting environment generally remained favorable, but reinsurance rates in
certain international territories had begun to soften. The unprecedented severity of Hurricane
Katrina, followed by Hurricanes Rita and Wilma, however, resulted in a net loss before convertible
preferred share dividends of $697.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005. As a result of
the unprecedented size of the industry-wide losses from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, rates
and limitations in coverage were favorable for each of the lines of business that we underwrote in
2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conduct our business primarily through our principal operating subsidiaries, PXRE Bermuda,
PXRE Reinsurance, and PXRE Europe. PXRE Bermuda is a broker-market reinsurer with $564.2&nbsp;million
of statutory capital and surplus as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, which, prior to the ratings downgrades
referenced above, principally underwrote treaty reinsurance for property (including marine and
aerospace) risks. PXRE Bermuda&#146;s reinsurance business was supported by an unlimited parental
guarantee from the Company and an excess of loss reinsurance treaty from PXRE Reinsurance that
provided $100.0&nbsp;million of reinsurance protection in excess of $110.0&nbsp;million in the period January
1, through March&nbsp;31, 2006 and $40.0&nbsp;million of reinsurance protection in excess of $150.0&nbsp;million
at April&nbsp;1, 2006. PXRE Bermuda is neither licensed nor admitted as an insurer in any jurisdiction
other than Bermuda.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE Reinsurance is a broker-market reinsurer with $138.0&nbsp;million of statutory capital and

principally underwrote treaty reinsurance for property (including marine and aerospace) risks.
PXRE Reinsurance is licensed, accredited or permitted to do business in each of the 50 states and

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company was formed in 1999 as part of the reorganization of PXRE Delaware, a Delaware
corporation. Prior to the reorganization, PXRE Delaware was the ultimate parent holding company of
the various PXRE companies and its common shares were publicly-traded on the New York Stock
Exchange. As a result of the reorganization, the Company became the ultimate parent holding
company of PXRE Delaware and the holders of PXRE Delaware common stock automatically became holders
of the same number of the Company&#146;s common shares. The reorganization was consummated at the close
of business on October&nbsp;5, 1999 and, on October&nbsp;6, 1999 the Company&#146;s common shares commenced
trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#147;PXT.&#148; The reorganization also involved
the establishment of a Bermuda-based reinsurance subsidiary, PXRE Bermuda, and a Barbados based
reinsurance subsidiary, PXRE Barbados.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s predecessor, PXRE Delaware, was organized in July&nbsp;1986 to succeed, through PXRE
Reinsurance, to the property and casualty reinsurance business carried on since 1982 by Phoenix
General Insurance Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company effected an internal reorganization of our subsidiaries on March&nbsp;15, 2005. The
purpose of the reorganization was to consolidate all of our non-Bermudian subsidiaries under a
newly formed holding company established in Ireland, PXRE Ireland. PXRE Ireland is a wholly owned
subsidiary of PXRE Bermuda. In the reorganization, PXRE Barbados distributed all of the common
shares of PXRE Delaware to PXRE Bermuda. PXRE Bermuda then contributed the common shares of PXRE
Delaware and the common shares of PXRE Europe to PXRE Ireland. Following the reorganization, PXRE
Barbados ceased writing any new reinsurance business and is expected to be wound up in an orderly
fashion during 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophe and risk excess business has been our primary focus since our predecessor company
was formed in 1986. Beginning in 1997, the pricing and terms in our core property reinsurance
markets began to deteriorate, resulting in a soft reinsurance market that only began to recover in
late 2000. During that time, we decided to pursue a variety of diversification efforts to enhance
our competitiveness and growth opportunities in that soft reinsurance market environment that
included: the establishment of a corporate member (&#147;PXRE Limited&#148;) at Lloyd&#146;s of London
(&#147;Lloyd&#146;s&#148;), an underwriting syndicate (&#147;PXRE Lloyds Syndicate 1224&#148;) and managing agent; the
establishment of an excess and surplus lines operation; the addition of a reinsurance platform
offering primarily casualty products directly to insurance companies (rather than through
reinsurance brokers); the enhancement of our international broker market reinsurance platform to
include additional lines of business, including casualty and credit risks; an acceleration of
business offerings to one of our managed business participants; and the formation of a finite
reinsurance unit.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake of the events of September&nbsp;11, 2001, we decided to return our focus to our core
property catastrophe, property per-risk, marine and aerospace reinsurance and retrocessional
products. Accordingly, we exited all of the non-property catastrophe and risk businesses other
than our finite business. In the first half of 2004, market conditions for finite risk
deteriorated sufficiently to cause us to exit this line of business as well. As a result of this
strategic realignment, we became solely focused on our catastrophe and risk excess business. This,
combined with the affects of our ratings downgrades, reduced the number of our employees from a
high of 103 in December&nbsp;1999 to 45 at December&nbsp;31, 2006.

and risk excess and (ii)&nbsp;exited lines &#150; based on PXRE&#146;s approach to managing the business. The
exited lines segment includes business previously written and classified by the Company as direct
casualty, Lloyd&#146;s, international casualty and finite.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, PXRE operated in two geographic segments in 2006 &#150; North American, representing
North American based risks written by North American based clients, and International (principally
worldwide risks including the United States, United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Latin America, the
Caribbean, Bermuda, Australia and Asia), representing all other premiums written.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of January&nbsp;1, 2007, virtually all of our in-force assumed reinsurance contracts had
expired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2006, unpaid net loss and loss expense reserves in the exited lines segment decreased
from $93.5&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2005 to $48.2&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2006 as a result of both
the payment of loss and loss expenses and commutations in this segment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no differences among the accounting policies of the segments as compared to PXRE&#146;s
consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE does not maintain separate balance sheet data for its operating segments nor does it
allocate net investment income, net realized investment gains or losses, other fee income, other
reinsurance related expense, operating expenses, foreign exchange gains and losses, or interest
expense to these segments. Accordingly, PXRE does not review and evaluate the financial results of
its operating segments based upon balance sheet data and these other income statement items.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our primary business during 2006 was our catastrophe and risk excess business. Our
catastrophe and risk excess portfolio consisted principally of property catastrophe excess of loss,
property pro-rata, property catastrophe retrocessional, property risk excess, and marine excess and
aerospace excess reinsurance coverages. The catastrophe and risk excess segment accounted for
substantially all of our net premiums earned for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.
This portfolio can be characterized as being comprised of coverages involving higher expected
margins and volatility.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net premiums earned in this segment were $84.9&nbsp;million, $389.6&nbsp;million and $301.8&nbsp;million for
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in premium volume in
2006 was due to cancellation and non-renewal of many of our reinsurance contracts due to our
ratings downgrades in February&nbsp;2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in premium volume for the catastrophe and risk excess segment from 2001 through
to 2005 was largely attributable to increases in the volume of business underwritten, and the rates
charged, as a result of large losses from catastrophic events (including the events of September
11, 2001 and Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne that occurred in 2004). The increase in
2005 can also be attributed to net reinstatement and additional premiums of $43.9&nbsp;million
associated with Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The catastrophe and risk excess segment produced underwriting income of $59.8&nbsp;million for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. This underwriting income was primarily attributable to the absence
of any significant loss events during 2006 as well as net favorable development on our prior year
losses and loss expenses, offset by a decrease in net premiums earned due to the cancellation and
non-renewal of the majority of our reinsurance portfolio following our ratings downgrades in
February&nbsp;2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The catastrophe and risk excess segment produced an underwriting loss of $664.4&nbsp;million for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005. The primary cause of this underwriting loss was the impact of
catastrophe losses arising from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma of $806.9&nbsp;million, after
reinsurance recoveries on our outwards reinsurance program and the impact of inwards and outwards
reinstatements and additional premiums. The underwriting loss from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and
Wilma affected both the North American and International segments due to treaties with worldwide
coverage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Largely as a result of the occurrence of Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, the
catastrophe and risk excess segment produced underwriting income of only $70.2&nbsp;million for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2004. The hurricane losses impacted both North American and International
geographic segments as reinsurance being assumed from non-U.S. based clients was exposed to North
American and Caribbean perils.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2006, 2005 and 2004, approximately 79%, 70% and 75%, respectively, of our property
catastrophe and risk excess net premiums written were derived from clients located outside of North
America, including clients located in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Latin America, the

Coast earthquakes. The perils underlying the International portion of this segment emanated
principally from European, Japanese and Caribbean windstorm, flood
and earthquake risks. In addition, we were exposed to major oil rig explosions, cruise ship disasters, satellite
failures, commercial airplane crashes and similar risks throughout the world. This business was
generally comprised of reinsurance contracts that incur losses only when events occur that impact
more than one risk or insured. Coverage for other perils can be negotiated on a case-by-case
basis. Protection under property catastrophe treaties was generally provided on an occurrence
basis, allowing our ceding company clients to combine losses that have been incurred in any single
event from multiple underlying policies.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance business operates on a subscription basis,
with the reinsurance intermediaries seeking participation for specific treaties among a number of
reinsurers. All subscribing reinsurers participate at substantially the same pricing, terms, and
conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Property Catastrophe Retrocessional Reinsurance</I>. We entered into retrocessional contracts
that provide property catastrophe coverage to other reinsurers or retrocedents. In providing
retrocessional coverage, we focused on reinsurance that covers the retrocedent on an excess of loss
basis when aggregate claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence of a covered peril and from
a multiple number of reinsureds exceed a contractually specified attachment point. The coverage
provided under excess of loss retrocessional contracts may be on a worldwide basis or limited in
scope to selected geographic areas. Coverage can also vary from &#147;all property&#148; perils to limited
coverage on selected perils, such as &#147;earthquake only&#148; coverage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrocessional coverage is characterized by high volatility, principally because
retrocessional contracts expose a reinsurer to an uncertain level of correlation with other
existing reinsurance contracts. In addition, the information available to retrocessional
underwriters concerning the original primary risk can be less precise than the information received
from primary companies directly. The lack of precision in the information received from
retrocessional clients also increases the difficulty of estimating losses in the immediate
aftermath of a catastrophe event. Moreover, exposures from retrocessional business can change
within a contract term if the underwriters of a retrocedent dramatically alter their book of
business after retrocessional coverage has been bound.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Property Risk Excess Reinsurance</I>. Our property risk excess business reinsured individual
property risks of ceding companies on a treaty basis. This business was comprised of a highly
diversified portfolio of property risk excess reinsurance contracts covering claims from individual
insurance policies issued by our ceding company clients. Loss exposures in this business included
the perils of fire, explosion, collapse, riot, vandalism, wind, tornado, flood and earthquake. For
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, 100% of the clients reinsured by us in this business were located
internationally, based on net premiums written.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the reinsurance contracts written in this business are exposed to losses on an
individual policy basis, we underwrote and priced the agreements based on anticipated claims
frequency. We used actuarial techniques to examine our ceding companies&#146; underwriting results as
well as the underwriting results from the ceding companies with comparable books of business and
pertinent industry results. These experience analyses were compared against actuarial exposure
analyses to refine our pricing assumptions. Our pricing also took
into account our variable and fixed expenses and our assessment of an appropriate return on the capital
required to support each individual contract relative to our portfolio of risks.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinsurance contracts that provide coverage of individual underlying insurance policies may
contain significant risk of accumulation of exposures to natural and other perils. Our
underwriting process recognizes these exposures. Natural perils, such as windstorm and earthquake,
are analyzed through our modeling systems. Other perils, such as fire, terrorism events and flood,
are considered on a contract-by-contract basis and monitored for cumulative aggregate exposure.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This property per risk business operates as a subscription market. Those reinsurers that
ultimately subscribe to any given treaty participate at substantially the same pricing, terms, and
conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Aerospace Reinsurance</I>. Our aerospace business included hull, aircraft liability, aircraft
products and space coverages. We wrote all of these exposures as reinsurance and retrocessional
coverages. In all cases, we track our exposures by original insured in order to monitor our
maximum exposures by major airline and by major manufacturer. The space business includes
satellite launch and in-orbit coverage. We had chosen to write space business predominately on a
proportional reinsurance basis where we sought to provide retrocessional support to underwriters
that have demonstrated a positive track record in this business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Marine Reinsurance</I>. The marine portfolio was very limited and provided retrocessional
coverage primarily against large insured market losses in the offshore energy, protection and
indemnity, and pollution business segments. In 2006 and 2005, we did not underwrite any marine
reinsurance contracts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Operating Segments-Exited Lines</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our exited lines segment consists principally of North American general liability, commercial
and personal auto liability, risk excess and other liability coverages; International pro rata
casualty coverages; all business written through PXRE Lloyd&#146;s Syndicate 1224; and credit coverages
and finite risk coverages. In the third quarter of 2000, we ceased accepting new and renewal risks
at PXRE Lloyd&#146;s Syndicate 1224. We ceased underwriting virtually all of the other non-finite
business within the exited lines segment in 2001 and all premiums written and earned relate to
reinsurance contracts that were entered into prior to September&nbsp;2001, but for which coverage had
not expired. We ceased underwriting finite risk business in 2004.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exited lines segment accounted for negative $0.4&nbsp;million, negative $1.3&nbsp;million and $2.4
million of net premiums written in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Virtually all of the
premiums under these contracts have now been earned and we do not expect to report a material
amount of premiums in this segment in 2007. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the exited lines segment
produced underwriting losses of $6.6&nbsp;million, $7.7&nbsp;million and $22.8&nbsp;million, respectively.
Underwriting losses for the exited lines segment in 2004 related primarily to adverse loss
development on a finite contract with Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company (&#147;LMC&#148;). During the
fourth quarter of 2004, this contract was commuted.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of 2005, we sold PXRE Limited, the sole corporate capital provider to
PXRE Lloyd&#146;s Syndicate 1224, to Chaucer Holdings PLC (&#147;Chaucer&#148;) and agreed terms for the
reinsurance to close of the liabilities of PXRE Lloyd&#146;s Syndicate 1224 into a Lloyd&#146;s syndicate
controlled by Chaucer. As part of the transaction, PXRE Bermuda entered into a stop loss
reinsurance contract with the Chaucer Syndicate, pursuant to which PXRE Bermuda is obligated to
indemnify the Chaucer Syndicate if reinsurance liabilities arising from the PXRE Lloyd&#146;s Syndicate
1224 exceed &#163;6.0&nbsp;million (approximately $11.6&nbsp;million), subject to an aggregate limit of liability
of &#163;12.0&nbsp;million (approximately $23.2&nbsp;million). Prior to the sale, net loss reserves for Lloyd&#146;s
Syndicate 1224 were $11.1&nbsp;million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, PXRE Bermuda has $1.1&nbsp;million
of net loss reserves related to the stop loss reinsurance contract.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, we have pursued a core strategy of short-tail, high-severity, low frequency lines
of business. Reinsurance treaties were reviewed for compliance with our general underwriting
standards and nearly all treaties were evaluated in part based upon our internal quantitative
analysis using our proprietary, internally developed models as well as third party models. We
sought to manage our risk of loss through a combination of aggregate exposure limits, underwriting
guidelines that take into account risks, prices and coverage and retrocessional agreements. As we
underwrote risks from a large number of clients based on information generally supplied by
reinsurance brokers, there was a risk of developing a concentration of exposure to loss in certain
geographic areas prone to specific types of catastrophes. We developed systems and software tools
to monitor and manage the accumulation of our exposure to such losses. We established guidelines
for maximum tolerable losses from a single or multiple catastrophic events based on historical data
and probabilistic risk limits. No assurance, however, can be given that these guidelines for
probabilistic risk limits will not be exceeded in an actual event. In fact, these guidelines for
probabilistic risk limits for a single event were exceeded by the unprecedented accumulation of
exposures in the Hurricane Katrina loss.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Risk Limits</U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sought to manage our risk of loss through a combination of aggregate exposure limits,
underwriting guidelines that take into account risks, prices and coverage and retrocessional
agreements. As we underwrote risks from a large number of clients based on information generally
supplied by reinsurance brokers, there was a risk of developing a concentration of exposure to loss
in certain geographic areas prone to specific types of catastrophes. We developed systems and
software tools to monitor and manage the accumulation of our exposure to such losses. We
established guidelines for maximum probabilistic tolerable losses from a single or multiple
catastrophic events based on historical data. However, no assurance can be given that these
maximums will not be exceeded in some future catastrophe.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the probabilistic risk limit is to seek to constrain the maximum amount of net
loss the Company could incur from a catastrophe event with a given mathematical probability. For
calendar year 2006 and prior periods, the Company had established internal risk parameters whereby
the Company did not want to lose more than 25% of its beginning of calendar year total &#147;capital&#148;
(&#147;capital&#148; being defined as the sum of shareholders&#146; equity and subordinated debt) from a single
large catastrophic event after adjusting the income statement effect of the gross loss from such an
event for (a)&nbsp;reinsurance recoveries and net reinstatement premiums received associated with the
catastrophic event and (b)&nbsp;the expected profitability of the Company for the calendar year
excluding the catastrophic event. Because it is probabilistic, the single event probabilistic risk
limit did not seek to be the maximum that could be lost from a particular event. What it did seek
to do, based on internal and third-party catastrophe models, was to estimate the amount of loss
from an event in each zone with a remote annual probability.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest assumption made in calculating the amount of exposure which could be accepted in
compliance with the single event probabilistic risk limit is the perils that are simulated in the
third party catastrophe models. The next largest assumption is the frequency assumptions for
catastrophes with given physical characteristics. Finally, the exposure information provided by
our clients is subject to change throughout the contract term. We assumed that the information we
had was correct and made assumptions for any missing data and expected changes in the portfolio
during the contract term. All of these assumptions could give rise to potential differences
between any actual event and the single event probabilistic risk limit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has never exceeded its single event probabilistic risk limit in any event other
than Hurricane Katrina. Under the guidelines of the probabilistic risk limits in place during
2005, we sought to limit our gross loss and loss expenses from any single event to $683.0&nbsp;million.
Our gross losses and loss expenses arising from Hurricane Katrina were $771.0&nbsp;million as of
December&nbsp;31, 2005, which was $88.0&nbsp;million over our guidelines for the probabilistic risk limits.
Several factors contributed to the Company&#146;s exceeding its probabilistic risk limits in Hurricane
Katrina. In setting probabilistic risk limits, we are heavily reliant on third party catastrophe
models, which did not include flood damage assessments other than storm surge associated with wind
events in the US. Although we attempt to account for the flood uncertainty in setting our risk
limits, the losses arising from flood coverage provided by our cedents to their policyholders for
Hurricane Katrina were more widespread than in past hurricanes. In certain cases, losses were
larger than expected for those treaties which saw increases in cedents exposures in the US Gulf
Coast from the time they purchased reinsurance from us to the time of Hurricane Katrina. Finally,
the unprecedented characteristics of Hurricane Katrina resulted in significant losses under
treaties which would not normally be expected to trigger such losses in a hurricane.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We utilized a two-tier approach to risk management, including both overall risk limits and a
portfolio optimization system. Our portfolio optimization system incorporates third-party
catastrophe modeling software and internally developed models. Our software tools use exposure
data provided by our ceding company clients to simulate catastrophic losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data output from the commercial modeling software is incorporated in our proprietary model for
multiple purposes. First, the data is used to estimate the amount of reinsurance premium that is
required to pay the long-term expected losses under the proposed contracts. Second, the data is
used to estimate correlation among the contracts we have written. The degree of correlation is
used to estimate the incremental capital required to support our participation on each proposed
contract. Finally, the data is used to monitor our cumulative exposure to individual perils across
all of our businesses. This system is used to price each reinsurance contract based on marginal
capital requirements, and enables our underwriters to dynamically evaluate potential new business
and exposures against the background of our existing business to optimize the overall portfolio.
Any new business bound is incorporated in this analytical approach to enable a real-time assessment
of the portfolio.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our pricing of property catastrophe reinsurance contracts is based on a combination of modeled
loss estimates, actual ceding company loss history, surcharges for potential unmodeled exposures
(such as flooding), fixed and variable expense estimates and profit
requirements. The profit requirements are based on incremental capital usage estimates described above and our
required return on consumed capital.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our portfolio was also subject to probabilistic risk limits for the business as a whole, by
territory and by type of events.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We maintain strict limits on our departmental underwriting authority. All risks of up to $1.5
million per treaty program must be approved by a minimum of two underwriters, one of whom must be
the department head. All risks above $1.5&nbsp;million must be referred to our underwriting committee.
While the Company was underwriting in 2006, the committee was comprised of our Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Operating Officer and two senior underwriters. The number of committee members
required for approval of a program increases with the amount of risk involved. One underwriter and
at least one member of the underwriting committee other than the underwriter&#146;s department head must
approve treaty program lines in excess of $1.5&nbsp;million and up to $5.0&nbsp;million. At least two
members of the underwriting committee must approve any treaty program lines that are greater than
$5.0&nbsp;million or any programs that are deemed outside the predominant risk distribution of the
overall portfolio.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2006, we provided reinsurance for international insurance and reinsurance companies
headquartered, principally, in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Latin America, the
Caribbean, Bermuda, Australia and Asia. In the United States, we reinsured national and regional
insurance and reinsurance companies and specialty insurance companies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, we have obtained substantially all of our reinsurance business through
reinsurance intermediaries, which represent our clients in negotiations for the purchase of
reinsurance. None of the reinsurance intermediaries through whom we obtain this business are
authorized to arrange any business in our name without our approval. We pay commissions to these
intermediaries or brokers that vary in size based on the amount of premiums and type of business
ceded. These commission payments constitute part of our total acquisition costs and are included
in our underwriting expenses. We generally pay reinsurance brokerage commissions believed to be
comparable to industry norms.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both 2006 and 2005, substantially all of gross premiums written were written in the broker
market. Approximately 100% of gross premiums written for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 were
arranged through brokers individually representing 10% or more of gross premiums written including
Benfield Greig Ltd. (approximately 41%), the worldwide branch offices of Guy Carpenter &#038; Company,
Inc., a subsidiary of Marsh &#038; McLennan Companies, Inc. (approximately 22%), Willis Re Inc.
(approximately 14%), and Aon Group Ltd. (approximately 12%). The commissions we paid to these
intermediaries are generally at the same rates as those paid to other intermediaries. The
Company&#146;s policy is not to pay different commission rates based on volume.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our counterparty credit and financial strength ratings were downgraded by the major rating
agencies in February&nbsp;2006 to a level that is generally
unacceptable to most of our reinsurance clients. These ratings downgrades had a significant negative impact on our competitive
position within all of our lines of reinsurance business.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position
of reinsurance companies. Due to the ratings downgrades in February&nbsp;2006 of our reinsurance
subsidiaries by A.M. Best, S&#038;P and Moody&#146;s, our competitive position in the reinsurance industry
suffered, and we were unable to retain our reinsurance portfolio or renew existing reinsurance
agreements. The downgrades resulted in the loss of virtually all of our reinsurance business as
ceding companies and brokers that place such business moved to other reinsurers with higher
ratings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitive forces in the property and casualty reinsurance industry are substantial. We
operate in an industry that is highly competitive and is undergoing a variety of challenging
developments. The industry has in recent years placed increased importance on credit ratings, size
and financial strength in the selection of reinsurers. This trend became more pronounced in the
wake of September&nbsp;11, 2001, with the formation at that time and subsequently, particularly
following the losses resulting from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, of many new large,
well-capitalized reinsurance companies in Bermuda.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these start-ups are focusing on the short tail property reinsurance markets in which
PXRE has historically competed. Other existing competitors have also formed &#147;side car&#148; reinsurers
to supplement their existing capacity to underwrite short tail property reinsurance business.
Additionally, reinsurers are tapping new markets and complementing their range of traditional
reinsurance products with innovative new products that bring together capital markets and
reinsurance experience.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We compete with numerous major reinsurance and insurance companies. These competitors, many
of whom have higher credit ratings, substantially greater financial, marketing and management
resources than us, include independent reinsurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of
established worldwide insurance companies, reinsurance departments of certain commercial insurance
companies and underwriting syndicates. We also may face competition from new market entrants or
from market participants that decide to devote greater amounts of capital to the types of business
written by us.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, we compete with reinsurers that provide property-based lines of reinsurance,
such as ACE Tempest Reinsurance Ltd., Arch Reinsurance Ltd., Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited, AXIS
Reinsurance Company, Endurance Specialty Insurance Ltd., Everest Reinsurance Company, IPC Re
Limited, Lloyd&#146;s of London syndicates, Montpelier Reinsurance Ltd., Munich Reinsurance Company,
Partner Reinsurance Company Ltd., Platinum Underwriters Reinsurance, Inc., Renaissance Reinsurance
Ltd., Swiss Reinsurance Company and XL Re Ltd. Competition varies depending on the type of
business being insured or reinsured.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to accurately measure the annual industry premium related to catastrophe and
risk excess reinsurance; and therefore, it is difficult to measure PXRE&#146;s share of this market.
Several factors contribute to this lack of market information, including the fact that catastrophe
reinsurance is often written by non-public reinsurance companies and public multi-line reinsurance
companies often do not disclose the amount of catastrophe and risk
excess reinsurance that they write. While we have access to the transactions presented to us, we do
not have access to all of the transactions in the market. Furthermore, we may not know the final
outcomes of all business submitted to PXRE due to (i)&nbsp;not receiving allocations on all business
authorized and (ii)&nbsp;not authorizing all business submitted. As a result of our 2006 ratings
downgrades, it is not possible to predict our market share in 2007, but we expect it will be
significantly less than 2005.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Business: Ceded Reinsurance Agreements</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We selectively managed our catastrophe exposures and increased our underwriting commitments by
retroceding some of our underwritten risks to other reinsurers through various retrocessional
arrangements. Our ceded reinsurance underwriting committee consisted of our Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and one senior underwriter responsible for the selection of
reinsurers as quota share reinsurers or as participating reinsurers in the catastrophe coverage
protecting us. Proposed reinsurers are evaluated at least annually based on consideration of a
number of factors including the management, financial statements and the historical experience of
the reinsurer. This procedure is followed whether or not a rating has been assigned to a proposed
reinsurer by any rating organization. All reinsurers, whether obtained through direct contact or
the use of reinsurance intermediaries, are subject to our approval. Although management carefully
selects our retrocessionaires, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our retrocessionaires
because the ceding of risk to retrocessionaires does not relieve us of our liability to clients.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table sets forth certain information regarding the volume of premiums we ceded
to other reinsurers pursuant to retrocessional agreements for the periods indicated:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in reinsurance ceded premiums written during 2006 as compared to 2005 was
largely due to ceded reinstatement and additional premiums related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and
Wilma recognized during 2005 compared to virtually none in 2006, offset, in part, by an increase of
$57.7&nbsp;million in ceded premiums written associated with excess of loss retrocessional catastrophe
coverage during 2006, including one of the collateralized catastrophe facilities entered into
during the fourth quarter of 2005 to protect the Company against a severe catastrophe event and the
related early termination charge of approximately $17.6&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2005, PXRE sponsored a catastrophe bond transaction
which was determined to be a derivative and recorded at fair value. During 2006, the increase of
$16.9&nbsp;million in other reinsurance related expense was due to the change in fair value of this
derivative, principally due to the passage of one year of the
transaction&#146;s risk coverage for calendar year 2006. The derivative will also provide $125.0&nbsp;million of coverage for the period
from January&nbsp;1, 2007 to December&nbsp;31, 2008 for second event losses in the same calendar year arising
from hurricanes in the Eastern and Gulf coasts of the United States, windstorms in northern Europe
and earthquakes in California. The recovery is based on modeled losses and is not limited to
PXRE&#146;s ultimate net loss from the loss event.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had reinsurance recoverables of $38.7&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, which represents a
65% decrease from the reinsurance recoverables of $111.9&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2005.
Approximately 92% of our reinsurance recoverables at December&nbsp;31, 2006 are either fully
collateralized or reside with entities rated &#147;A-&#148; or its equivalent or higher by A.M. Best or S&#038;P
(as of January&nbsp;2007).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For reported losses, we establish liabilities when we receive notice of the claim. It is our
general policy to establish liabilities for reported losses in an amount equal to the liability set
by the reinsured. In certain instances, we will conduct an investigation to determine if the
amount established by the reinsured is appropriate or if it should be adjusted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For incurred but not reported losses, a variety of methods have been developed in the
insurance industry for use in determining our provision for such liabilities. In general, these
methods involve the extrapolation of reported loss data to estimate ultimate losses. Our loss
calculation methods generally rely upon a projection of ultimate losses based upon the historical
patterns of reported loss development. Additionally, we establish provisions through our
liabilities for incurred but not reported losses for any identified deficiencies in the liabilities
for reported losses set by our reinsureds.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reserving for catastrophe losses, our estimates are influenced by underwriting information
provided by our clients, industry catastrophe models and our internal analyses of this information.
This reserving approach can cause significant development for an accident year. As an event
matures, we rely more on our own development patterns by type of event as well as contract
information to project ultimate losses for the event. Our loss estimation methods are described in
more detail under Item&nbsp;7. &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations &#150; Critical Accounting Policy Disclosures &#150; Estimation of Losses and Loss Expenses.&#148;
Reserving for catastrophe losses is an inherently uncertain process and there is a risk that our
ultimate liability for a catastrophe event will exceed our best estimate of such liability.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reserving for non-catastrophe losses from recent years, we are usually required to make
assumptions concerning the expected loss ratio usually for broad lines of business, but sometimes
on an individual contract basis. We consider historical loss ratios for each line of business and
utilize information provided by our clients and estimates provided by underwriters and actuaries
concerning the impact of pricing and coverage changes. As experience emerges, we revise our prior
estimates concerning pricing adequacy and non-catastrophe loss potential for our coverages and we
will eventually rely solely on our estimated development pattern in projecting ultimate losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management believes that our overall liability for losses and loss expenses recorded as of
December&nbsp;31, 2006 is adequate. There is a risk that our liability for losses and loss expenses
could prove to be greater than expected in any year, because of the inherent uncertainty in the
reserving process with a consequent adverse impact on future earnings and shareholders&#146; equity.
Estimating the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses is an imprecise science subject to
variables that are influenced by both internal and external factors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our liability for losses and loss expenses has an average expected duration of 2&nbsp;years for the
catastrophe and risk excess segment and an average duration of 5&nbsp;years for the exited lines
segment.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, we have focused on property-related coverages. In contrast to casualty losses,
which frequently are slow to be reported and may be determined only through the lengthy,
unpredictable process of litigation, property losses tend to be reported more promptly and usually
are settled within a shorter time period. However, the estimation of losses for catastrophe
reinsurers is inherently less reliable than for reinsurers of risks
that have an established historical pattern of losses. In addition, we are required to make estimates of losses based on
limited information from ceding companies as well as our own underwriting data due to the
significant reporting delays that normally occur under our retrocessional book of business
and with respect to insured losses that occur near the end of a reporting period.
Additionally, our estimates are subject to a high level of uncertainty due to the short period of
time that has passed since Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma occurred, and the extremely complex
and unique causation and coverage issues associated with Hurricane Katrina, including the
appropriate attribution of losses to wind or flood damage as opposed to other perils such as fire,
business interruption or civil commotion. The underlying personal lines policies generally contain
exclusions for flood damage; however, water damage caused by wind may be covered. We expect that
causation and coverage issues may not be resolved for a considerable period of time and may be
influenced by evolving legal and regulatory developments. Our loss estimation methods for these
hurricanes are described in more detail under <I>Item&nbsp;7. &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#150; Critical Accounting Policy Disclosures &#150; Estimation
of Losses and Loss Expenses.&#148;</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, we have underwritten a small amount of casualty reinsurance. In 1998, we began
underwriting new casualty lines of business and, in 1999 and 2000 we substantially expanded our
casualty and finite businesses. In September&nbsp;2001, we ceased underwriting non-finite casualty
business. In the first half of 2004, we ceased underwriting finite risk business. With respect to
our casualty business, significant delays, ranging up to several years or more, can be expected
between the reporting of a loss to us and settlement of our liability for that loss. As a result,
such future claim settlements could be influenced by changing rates of inflation and other economic
conditions, changing legislative, judicial and social environments and changes in our claims
handling procedures. In addition, most of the risks reinsured in our finite business are also
casualty risks and are subject to some of the same risks as our casualty business. While the
reserving process is difficult and subjective for ceding companies, the inherent uncertainties of
estimating such reserves are even greater for a reinsurer, due primarily to the longer time between
the date of the occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer, the
diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties, the necessary
reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing reserving
practices among ceding companies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our difficulty in accurately predicting casualty losses may also be exacerbated by the limited
amount of statistically significant historical data regarding losses on our casualty lines of
business. We must therefore rely on the inherently less reliable historical loss patterns reported
by ceding companies and industry loss standards in calculating our casualty reserves. Thus, the
actual casualty losses and loss expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from estimates of
liabilities reflected in our consolidated financial statements.

incurred losses. During 2006, there was less than $0.5&nbsp;million of adverse development to our
estimate of net losses and loss expenses for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately ninety-five percent of our projected net ultimate incurred loss for Hurricanes
Katrina, Rita and Wilma has been formally reported to us as paid or case reserves. However, as of
December&nbsp;31, 2006, we have paid less than 60% of our net incurred loss amounts with respect to
these hurricanes. Accordingly, the liability for loss and loss expenses incurred with respect to
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma represents management&#146;s best estimate of our ultimate liability
for claims arising from these catastrophes. Our estimation of loss and loss expense liability
involves significant uncertainties and is based on complex and subjective judgments. Because of
the uncertainty in the process of estimating our losses from catastrophe events, there is a risk
that our liability for losses and loss expenses could prove to be inadequate, with a consequent
adverse impact on our future earnings and shareholders&#146; equity. <I>See Item&nbsp;7. &#147;Management&#146;s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#150; Update on Critical
Accounting Policy Disclosures &#150; Estimation of Losses and Loss Expenses.&#148;</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our incurred loss for these events represents our best estimate, which is primarily based on
reported claims, modeling, a review of affected contracts and discussions with our clients;
however, some of our cedents who have incurred losses from multiple events, may have the ability to
choose which losses to cede, and as such, in future periods they may reallocate losses amongst the
2005 events.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table presents the development of our GAAP balance sheet liability for losses
and loss expenses for the period 1996 through 2006. The top line of the table shows the
liabilities at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This reflects the estimated
amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in that year and all prior years that are
unpaid at the balance sheet date, including losses incurred but not yet reported to us. The upper
portion of the table shows the cumulative amounts subsequently paid as of successive years with
respect to such liabilities. The lower portion of the table shows the re-estimated amount of
previously recorded liabilities based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. These
estimates change as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for
individual years. A redundancy (deficiency)&nbsp;exists when the re-estimated liability at each
December&nbsp;31 is less (greater)&nbsp;than the prior liability estimate. The &#147;cumulative redundancy
(deficiency)&#148; depicted in the table, for any particular calendar year, represents the aggregate
change in the initial estimates over all subsequent calendar years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each amount in the table below includes the
effects of all changes in amounts for prior
periods. For example, if a loss determined
in 1998 to be $150,000 was first reserved in
1996 at $100,000, the $50,000 deficiency
(actual loss minus original estimate) would
be included in the cumulative redundancy
(deficiency)&nbsp;in each of the years 1996-1997
shown below. This table does not present
accident or policy year development data.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calendar year 2006, we experienced net favorable development of $10.4&nbsp;million. In
calendar years 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002 we experienced net adverse development of $23.9&nbsp;million,
$12.0&nbsp;million, $44.7&nbsp;million and $23.9&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2006, we experienced net favorable development of $10.4&nbsp;million for prior-year losses
and loss expenses, comprised of $16.3&nbsp;million of favorable development on our catastrophe and risk
excess segment and $5.9&nbsp;million of adverse development on our exited lines segment. The $16.3
million of prior year favorable development in the catastrophe and risk excess segment was
primarily related to favorable reported loss activity on our prior-year non-significant catastrophe
losses. During 2006, there was no material change to our estimate of net losses and loss expenses
for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Prior year losses in the exited lines segment increased
because of higher than expected reported claims.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2005, we experienced net adverse development of $23.9&nbsp;million for prior-year losses and
loss expenses, comprised of $17.3&nbsp;million of adverse development on our catastrophe and risk excess
segment and $6.6&nbsp;million of adverse development on our exited lines segment. The $17.3&nbsp;million of
prior-year catastrophe and risk excess losses were primarily related to re-estimation of the 2004
storm losses following additional claim reports from cedents. Prior year losses in the exited
lines segment increased because of higher than expected reported claims.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2004, we experienced net adverse development of $12.0&nbsp;million for prior-year losses and
loss expenses, comprised of $11.4&nbsp;million catastrophe and risk excess net favorable development and
$23.4&nbsp;million exited lines net adverse development. The favorable development in the catastrophe
and risk excess business was primarily related to case reserve takedowns from past significant
catastrophes, such as the 2002 European floods. The $23.4&nbsp;million net adverse development related
to exited lines was due primarily to $13.7&nbsp;million of adverse loss development related to an
adverse litigation outcome concerning one aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contract (the &#147;LMC
XOL Contract&#148;) that was commuted during the fourth quarter of 2004 following an adverse ruling in
litigation. We also experienced $19.7&nbsp;million of adverse development on our exited direct casualty
reinsurance operations. The primary cause of the adverse development was higher than expected
reported losses in 2004. Favorable development in other exited lines partially offset the adverse
development experienced on the LMC XOL Contract and our exited direct reinsurance operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2003, we experienced net adverse development of $44.7&nbsp;million for prior-year losses and
loss expenses, $21.8&nbsp;million of which was due to loss development on our exited direct casualty
reinsurance operations, $8.8&nbsp;million adverse development from aerospace claims arising to a
significant degree from our first receipt of notice that the increase in industry losses related to
a 1998 air crash had resulted in the exhaustion of deductibles under three aerospace contracts
between PXRE and Reliance Insurance Company and $8.2&nbsp;million of development from finite contracts,
$7.3&nbsp;million of which related to the LMC XOL Contract noted above.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $21.8&nbsp;million of 2003 adverse development attributable to our exited direct casualty
reinsurance operations was primarily caused by $16.4&nbsp;million of general liability development, with
$15.3&nbsp;million of this development attributable to the 2001 and
2000 accident years. In addition to the explicit recognition of more than expected reported losses during the year,
there was a shift in actuarial methods with the maturing of the underwriting years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2002, we experienced net adverse development of $23.9&nbsp;million for prior-year losses and
loss expenses, with $16.9&nbsp;million from our exited lines segment, $16.2&nbsp;million of which was due to
adverse loss development on our exited direct casualty reinsurance operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In each of the calendar years 2001 to 2006, our exited direct casualty business had sustained
losses beyond what was originally estimated. We underwrote this business primarily from 1999 to
2001. Initially, as described in <I>&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations &#150; Critical Accounting Policy Disclosures &#150; Estimation of Losses and Loss
Expenses,&#148; </I>we utilized several loss reserving techniques, including those which were dependent on
industry loss reporting patterns as provided by various industry sources, estimates of pricing
adequacy as measured by the expected loss ratio, and earned premiums. As the data and the business
have matured, we have placed more weight on loss development techniques that rely on the loss
reporting pattern and reported losses. As a result of shifting to actuarial methodologies more
appropriate to a seasoned portfolio as well as new information from both the industry and clients,
we have re-estimated our incurred losses recorded related to our direct casualty business for
several years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2000, we experienced net adverse development of $59.6&nbsp;million for prior-year losses and
loss expenses, $43.4&nbsp;million of which was due to loss development from catastrophic events that
occurred late in 1999. In the last week of December&nbsp;1999, French storms Lothar and Martin resulted
in significant losses to several of our reinsureds. Because of the lateness in the year of the
storms&#146; occurrences and the unprecedented nature of the catastrophes, only limited relevant data
could be obtained from both our clients and the industry by the time the loss reserving estimates
were required to be determined. As a result, our reserves (which utilize industry data as a check
on client-supplied data) were increased in subsequent years due to the events that occurred at
year-end 1999. There was a similar result in the estimation of losses due to Hurricane George,
which occurred in 1998, in that industry wide losses were significantly underestimated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large portion of our adverse development of our exited direct casualty business during the
previous years was due to significant industry-wide underpricing of underwriting years 1998 to
2001. The complete effect of the soft market during that period was not initially reflected in the
historical industry loss ratios. We estimate that the underpricing of these underwriting years
amounted to $21.2&nbsp;million of the $44.7&nbsp;million of 2003 adverse development, $17.0&nbsp;million of the
$23.9&nbsp;million of 2002 adverse development, $9.0&nbsp;million of the $19.3&nbsp;million of adverse development
in 2001 and $10.5&nbsp;million of the $59.6&nbsp;million of adverse development in 2000.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adverse development in each of the years discussed above is due to a variety of factors
outlined in the section <I>&#147;Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations &#151; Critical Accounting Policy Disclosures &#150; Estimation of Losses and Loss Expenses&#148;</I>,
including late reporting by clients (particularly retrocedents) and the imprecise nature of the
actuarial science accentuated when the risk is catastrophe coverage rather than large numbers of
homogeneous small dollar risks. Our reserving assumptions are updated
on an ongoing basis as new information becomes available to minimize this residual adverse
development, which arises from many causes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditions and trends that have affected reserve development in the past may not necessarily
occur in the future. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to extrapolate the future adequacy

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006, our investment strategy focused on maintaining the majority of our investment
portfolio in high quality fixed income investments and short-term securities. As of December&nbsp;31,
2006, approximately 98.7% of our investment portfolio was comprised of fixed maturity and
short-term securities with a weighted average credit rating of AAA and approximately 1.3% of our
portfolio was comprised of investments in four different hedge funds and other limited
partnerships. One of our goals with respect to the investment portfolio is to achieve a low
correlation between risks in our underwriting operation and risks in our investment portfolio. We
utilize outside portfolio managers to manage our investments, with strict oversight by management
and our Board of Directors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have established general procedures and guidelines for our investment portfolio. General
Re-New England Asset Management, Inc. (&#147;NEAM&#148;) and Mariner Investment Group, Inc. (&#147;Mariner&#148;), a
specialist in alternative investments, are our principal investment managers. Our investment
policies stress conservation of principal, diversification of risk and liquidity. As of December
31, 2006, our invested assets consist primarily of bonds with fixed maturities and short-term
investments, but also include limited amounts of hedge funds and other non-hedge fund limited
partnership investments. Our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as
well as to risks inherent in particular securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2006, we had, at fair value, $517.8&nbsp;million in fixed maturities, $671.2
million in short-term investments (which we define as investments which have an original maturity
of one year or less), $12.8&nbsp;million in hedge funds, and $2.4&nbsp;million in other invested assets that
are comprised of other limited partnerships. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. <I>See also, Item&nbsp;7, &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations &#150; Critical Accounting Policy Disclosures &#150; Valuation of Investments&#148; and Item
7A. &#147;Investments&#148; </I>for further information regarding our investment portfolio, including our hedge
fund portfolio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to, and as a result of, the downgrades in our ratings that occurred in February
2006, we sold approximately $490.5&nbsp;million of fixed income securities held by PXRE Bermuda, and
additionally executed redemption orders for all of the Company&#146;s hedge fund investments. The
proceeds of the sales of the fixed income securities were all received by the first week of March
2006 and were reinvested in commercial paper and other short term investments. With respect to the
proceeds of the sales of the hedge fund investments, approximately 92% of such proceeds were
received by December&nbsp;31, 2006. The remainder is expected to be received by June&nbsp;30, 2007. As a
result of these steps, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet the currently foreseen needs
of our counterparties.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, PXRE recorded $7.3&nbsp;million in other than
temporary impairment charges, $0.4&nbsp;million of which was recovered due to sales of securities during
the third and fourth quarters of 2006. The other than temporary impairment charges recorded in the
current year relate to investments that the Company may not have the ability to hold to maturity or
recovery as a result of the ratings downgrades of PXRE that occurred in February&nbsp;2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unrealized losses amounting to $1.1&nbsp;million of the total unrealized loss on fixed maturity
investments as of December&nbsp;31, 2006 relate to investments that PXRE has deposited in a trust for
the benefit of a cedent in connection with certain finite reinsurance transactions. The remaining
unrealized losses are primarily due to increases in interest rates since the purchase dates for
individual securities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.M. Best maintains a letter scale rating system ranging from &#147;A&#043;&#043;&#148; (superior)&nbsp;to &#147;F&#148; (in
liquidation). S&#038;P maintains a letter scale rating system ranging from &#147;AAA&#148; (extremely strong) to
&#147;R&#148; (under regulatory supervision).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property catastrophe reinsurance market is highly sensitive to the ratings assigned by the
rating agencies. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, each of the major rating agencies placed
the credit ratings of our reinsurance subsidiaries on CreditWatch negative or the equivalent. On
February&nbsp;16, 2006, A.M. Best downgraded its financial strength ratings on PXRE Reinsurance and PXRE
Bermuda from &#147;A-&#148; to &#147;B&#043;&#043;&#148; with a negative outlook. In February, 2006, A.M. Best further
downgraded its financial strength ratings on these entities from &#147;B&#043;&#043;&#148; to &#147;B&#043;&#148; with a negative
implication and S&#038;P downgraded its counterparty credit and financial strength ratings on PXRE
Reinsurance and PXRE Bermuda from &#147;A-&#148; to &#147;BBB&#043;&#148; and placed these ratings on CreditWatch with
negative implications. Thereafter S&#038;P further
downgraded its counterparty credit and financial strength ratings on
PXRE Reinsurance and PXRE
Bermuda from &#147;BBB&#043;&#148; to &#147;BBB-&#148; and Moody&#146;s downgraded its insurance financial strength rating of
PXRE Reinsurance from &#147;Baa1&#148; to &#147;Baa2&#148; and placed this rating under review for possible further
downgrade. Subsequently, Moody&#146;s further downgraded its insurance financial strength rating of
PXRE Reinsurance from &#147;Baa2&#148; to &#147;Baa3&#148; and placed this rating under review for possible further
downgrade. In April, 2006, after finding that operational ratings below the critical &#147;A&#148; category
provided little value for a reinsurer, we announced that we had requested that the major credit
rating agencies withdraw their financial strength and claims paying ratings of the Company and its
operating subsidiaries. In the wake of this request, A.M. Best downgraded its financial strength
ratings of PXRE Reinsurance and PXRE Bermuda from &#147;B&#043;&#148; to &#147;B&#148; and withdrew these ratings; S&#038;P
downgraded its counterparty credit and financial strength rating on PXRE Reinsurance and PXRE
Bermuda from &#147;BBB-&#148; to &#147;BB&#043;&#148; and then withdrew these ratings; and Moody&#146;s downgraded its insurance
financial strength rating of PXRE Reinsurance from &#147;Baa3&#148; to &#147;Ba2&#148; and then withdrew this rating.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position
of reinsurance companies. Due to the ratings downgrades and withdrawal of the operational ratings
of our reinsurance subsidiaries by A.M. Best, S&#038;P and Moody&#146;s, our competitive position in the
insurance industry has suffered and we have been unable to retain our reinsurance portfolio and
renew many of our existing reinsurance agreements. These downgrades resulted in a substantial loss
of business as ceding companies and brokers that place such business moved to other reinsurers with
higher ratings. A change in any such rating is at the discretion of the respective rating
agencies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is increasingly common for our assumed reinsurance contracts to contain terms that would
allow our clients to cancel the contract if we are downgraded below various rating levels by one or
more rating agencies. Whether a client would exercise such rights would depend, among other
things, on the reasons for such a downgrade, the extent of the downgrade, the prevailing market
conditions, and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage. As of January&nbsp;1,
2006, more than 75% of our business (by premium volume) was subject to contractual provisions
allowing clients additional rights upon a decline in PXRE&#146;s ratings or capital. As of December&nbsp;31,
2006, almost all of the Company&#146;s reinsurance contracts had either been cancelled, non-renewed or
expired.

March 14, 2007, we announced a merger with Argonaut and the formation of Peleus Re. A.M.
Best has granted a financial strength rating of &#147;A-&#148; to Peleus Re and has re-rated PXRE Bermuda and
PXRE Reinsurance &#147;B&#043;.&#148; No assurance can be given that these ratings will be retained if the merger

oversight by the BMA. We agreed that effective March 12, 2007 PXRE Bermuda will not write
any insurance business other than intra-group reinsurance in support of Peleus Re without the
approval of the BMA.</DIV>




<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also agreed with the BMA that
effective March 12, 2007, PXRE Bermuda,
before reducing its total statutory capital by 10% or more, in the aggregate, as set out in its
previous year&#146;s financial statements, in any calendar year, shall apply to the BMA for its
approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PXRE Bermuda may reduce its total statutory capital,
as set out in its previous year&#146;s financial statements, by less
than 10%, in the aggregate in any
calendar year, provided that at least fourteen days before payment of such distribution it files with
the BMA a certificate signed by the insurer&#146;s principal representative and two of its directors

statutory capital will not cause the insurer to fail to meet its relevant margins.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, PXRE Bermuda may declare and pay dividends in respect of any

exceed the amount of its general business liabilities by an amount greater than the prescribed
minimum solvency margin. PXRE Bermuda, as a Class&nbsp;4 insurer, is required to maintain a minimum
solvency margin equal to the greatest of: (a) $100.0&nbsp;million, (b)&nbsp;50% of net premiums written
(with a deduction for ceded reinsurance from gross premiums written not exceeding 25% of gross
premiums written) or (c)&nbsp;15% of loss reserves. In addition, PXRE Bermuda is prohibited from
declaring or paying any dividends during any financial year it is in breach of its minimum solvency
margin or minimum liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of such dividends would cause it
to fail to meet such margin or ratio. If it fails to meet its minimum solvency margin or minimum
liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year, the insurer will be prohibited, without the
approval of the BMA, from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year. If its
total statutory capital and surplus falls to $75.0&nbsp;million or less, it will have to comply with
additional reporting requirements as mandated by the BMA.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act provides a minimum liquidity ratio for general business. An insurer engaged in
general business is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than 75% of
the amount of its relevant liabilities. Relevant assets include cash and time deposits, quoted
investments, unquoted bonds and debentures, first liens on real estate, investment income due and
accrued, accounts and premiums receivable and reinsurance balances receivable. There are certain
categories of assets that, unless specifically permitted by the BMA, do not automatically qualify
as relevant assets such as unquoted equity securities, investments in and advances to affiliates,
real estate and collateral loans. The relevant liabilities are total general business
insurance reserves and total other liabilities less deferred income tax and sundry liabilities
(by interpretation, those not specifically defined).

investments, deposits of securities for the benefit of a reinsured, methods of accounting, periodic
examinations of the financial condition and affairs of reinsurers, the form

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Company and PXRE Delaware are subject to regulation under the insurance
holding company statutes of various U.S. states, including Connecticut. These laws and regulations
vary from state to state, but generally require an insurance holding company and reinsurers that
are subsidiaries of an insurance holding company to register with the state regulatory authorities
and to file with those authorities certain reports including
information  concerning their capital structure, ownership, financial condition, and general business operations. Moreover, PXRE
Reinsurance may not enter into certain transactions, including certain reinsurance agreements,
management agreements, and service contracts, with members of its insurance holding company system,
unless it has first notified the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner of its intention to enter into
any such transaction and the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner does not disapprove of such
transaction within the period specified by the Connecticut insurance statute. Among other things,
such related company transactions are subject to the requirements that their terms be fair and
reasonable, charges or fees for services performed be reasonable and the interests of policyholders
not be adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State laws also require prior notice or regulatory agency approval of direct or indirect
changes in control of an insurer, reinsurer, or its holding company, and of certain significant
inter-corporate transfers of assets within the holding company structure. An investor who acquires
or attempts to acquire shares representing or convertible into more than 10% of the voting power of
the securities of the Company would become subject to at least some of such regulations, would
require approval by the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner prior to acquiring such shares and would
be required to file certain notices and reports with the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner prior
to such acquisition. <I>See &#147;Market for Registrant&#146;s Common Equity and Related Shareholder Matters&#148;</I>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal sources of cash for the payment of operating expenses, debt service obligations,
and dividends by the Company are the receipt of dividends from PXRE Reinsurance, PXRE Bermuda and
PXRE Ireland. Under the Connecticut insurance laws, the maximum amount of dividends or other
distributions that PXRE Reinsurance may declare or pay within any twelve-month period from
unassigned surplus, without regulatory approval, is limited to the lesser of (a)&nbsp;earned surplus or
(b)&nbsp;the greater of 10% of policyholders&#146; surplus at December&nbsp;31 of the preceding year or 100% of
net income for the twelve-month period ended December&nbsp;31 of the preceding year, all determined in
accordance with SAP. Accordingly, the Connecticut insurance laws could limit the amount of
dividends available for distribution by PXRE Reinsurance without prior regulatory approval,
depending upon a variety of factors outside our control, including the frequency and severity of
catastrophe and other loss events and changes in the reinsurance market, in the insurance
regulatory environment and in general economic conditions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Connecticut has adopted regulations respecting certain minimum capital
requirements for property and casualty companies, based upon a model adopted by the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (the &#147;NAIC&#148;). The NAIC assists state insurance supervisory
officials in achieving insurance regulatory objectives, including the maintenance and improvement
of state regulation. The risk-based capital regulations adopted provide for the use of a formula
to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risk
characteristics of a company&#146;s products and investment portfolio to identify weakly capitalized companies. As of December&nbsp;31,
2006, PXRE Reinsurance&#146;s statutory capital and surplus was $138.0&nbsp;million and substantially
exceeded its calculated risk-based capital authorized control level, which was $15.4&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NAIC&#146;s Insurance Regulatory Information System (&#147;IRIS&#148;) was developed by a committee of
state insurance regulators and is primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in
executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies
operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies
&#147;usual values&#148; for each ratio. Departure from the usual values on four or more of the ratios can
lead to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an
insurer&#146;s business. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, PXRE Reinsurance&#146;s
results were within the usual values for each of the thirteen ratios, except for one ratio in 2006,
five ratios in 2005 and three ratios in 2004. The one ratio that fell outside the range in 2006, a
two year average operating ratio, was due to increased losses primarily due to losses incurred from
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, including an $80.0&nbsp;million full limit loss on an excess of loss
agreement where PXRE Reinsurance reinsured PXRE Bermuda. The five ratios that fell outside the
range in 2005 were due to (a)&nbsp;decreases in net writings in 2005 due to an increase in net premiums
written by PXRE Bermuda previously written by PXRE Reinsurance, (b)&nbsp;decreased investment yield
associated with general market conditions and (c)&nbsp;increased losses and decreased surplus primarily
due to losses incurred from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, including an $80.0&nbsp;million full
limit loss on an excess of loss agreement where PXRE Reinsurance reinsured PXRE Bermuda. The three
ratios that fell outside the range in 2004 were due to (a)&nbsp;decreases in net writings in 2004 due to
a decrease in finite premiums in 2004 compared to 2003 and net premiums written by PXRE Bermuda
previously written by PXRE Reinsurance, (b)&nbsp;decreased investment yield associated with general
market conditions and (c)&nbsp;decreased surplus primarily due to dividends paid and distributions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the U.S.
insurance industry, some of which could have an effect on reinsurers and insurers. Among the
proposals that have in the past been or are at present being considered are the possible
introduction of federal regulation in addition to, or in lieu of, the current system of state
regulation of insurers, an initiative to create a federally guaranteed disaster reinsurance pool
pre-funded by insurers and proposals in various state legislatures (some of which have been
enacted) to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted
by the NAIC. We are unable to predict what effect, if any, the foregoing developments may have on
our operations and financial condition in the future.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under current Bermuda law, no income, withholding or capital gains taxes are imposed on the
Company or PXRE Bermuda. The Company and PXRE Bermuda have each received an assurance from the
Minister of Finance under The Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act, 1966 of Bermuda, to the
effect that in the event of there being enacted in Bermuda any legislation imposing tax computed on
profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature
of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of any such tax shall not be applicable to
the Company or PXRE Bermuda or to any of their operations or their shares, debentures or other
obligations until March&nbsp;28, 2016. These assurances are subject to the proviso that they are not to
be construed so as to prevent the application of any tax or duty to such persons as are ordinarily
resident in Bermuda (the Company and PXRE Bermuda are not currently so designated) or to prevent
the application of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of The Land Tax Act of 1967 of
Bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to the land leased to the Company or PXRE Bermuda. The
Company and PXRE Bermuda each pay annual Bermuda government fees and PXRE Bermuda pays annual

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE Ireland is an Irish incorporated company established as a holding company and will
coordinate the administration, finances and activities of any future non-Bermudian subsidiary
companies. PXRE Ireland is governed by the Companies Acts 1963 to 2003. Under Irish law, PXRE
Ireland is subject to tax on its worldwide income. The tax rate is a function of the nature of the
income of PXRE Ireland. Income in respect of trading (active income) is subject to tax at the rate
of 12.5%. Income arising in respect of investments (passive income) is subject to tax in Ireland
at a rate of 25%. In relation to a company which acts as a holding company in Ireland, certain
exemptions and reliefs are available in respect of gains produced by the disposal of qualifying
subsidiaries and the receipt of dividend income from such subsidiaries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that PXRE Ireland and PXRE Delaware will be entitled to the benefits provided by
the income tax treaty between Ireland and the United States, which reduce the rate of withholding
tax applicable to dividends paid by a U.S. corporation to an Irish shareholder from the generally
applicable rate of 30% to 5%. If PXRE Delaware and/or PXRE Ireland were determined not to be
eligible for these benefits and should PXRE Delaware pay dividends to PXRE Ireland, the consequent
increase in withholding tax to the generally applicable 30% rate could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PXRE U.S. Companies carry on business, and are subject to taxation, in the United States.
The Company believes that it and its subsidiaries, other than the PXRE U.S. Companies, have
operated and will continue to operate their business in a manner that will not cause them to be
treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States. Tax conventions between the
United States and Bermuda may provide relief to PXRE Bermuda if it is
deemed to be engaged in the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. Under the tax convention between Bermuda and the United
States (the &#147;Bermuda Treaty&#148;), a Bermuda company predominantly engaged in the insurance business,
which meets certain ownership requirements, such as PXRE Bermuda, is subject to U.S. income tax on
its insurance income found to be effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business only if that
trade or business is conducted through a permanent establishment in the United States. As a
holding company that is not predominantly engaged directly in an insurance business, the Company is
not entitled to the benefits of the Bermuda Treaty. Similar benefits are provided under the tax
convention between the United Stated and Ireland (the &#147;Irish Treaty&#148;) although that treaty is not
limited to insurance companies. Each of the Company, PXRE Bermuda and PXRE Ireland operates under
guidelines that are intended to minimize the risk that they will be treated as engaged in a U.S.
trade or business; and PXRE Bermuda and PXRE Ireland each operates under guidelines that are
intended to minimize the risk that it will be found to have a U.S. permanent establishment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis, we do not expect that the Company or our subsidiaries, other than the PXRE U.S.
Companies, will be required to pay U.S. federal corporate income taxes (other than withholding
taxes on certain U.S. source investment income and excise taxes on reinsurance premiums as
described below). However, because there is uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being
engaged in a trade or business in the United States even if the guidelines are complied with in all
aspects, there can be no assurance that (i)&nbsp;the IRS will not contend successfully that the Company
or a non-U.S. subsidiary is engaged in a trade or business in the United States, that (ii)&nbsp;PXRE
Bermuda will qualify for the Bermuda Treaty or PXRE Ireland will qualify for the Irish Treaty now
or in the future, or that (iii)&nbsp;the Bermuda Treaty and/or Irish Treaty will not be terminated or
revised in a manner that could adversely affect any protection from U.S. corporate tax that they
currently provide.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such case, the income considered to be &#147;effectively connected&#148; with such U.S. trade or
business (both underwriting income and a portion of investment income), or income attributable to a
U.S. permanent establishment if treaty benefits are claimed, would be subject to U.S. federal
income tax at regular corporate rates. The maximum federal income tax rate for corporations is
currently 35%. Such U.S. federal income tax, if imposed, would be based on effectively connected
income computed in a manner generally analogous to that applied to the income of a U.S.
corporation. The IRS takes the position that a non-U.S. corporation can generally claim deductions
and credits only if it timely files a U.S. income tax return and that penalties may be assessed for
the failure to timely file tax returns. The U.S. Tax Court recently held, however, that foreign
corporations determined to be doing business in the United States may claim deductions and credits
even if they have not timely filed a return. In addition, the U.S. imposes a branch profits tax of
30% each year on a non-U.S. corporation&#146;s earnings and profits (reduced by the regular corporate
tax and with certain other adjustments) effectively connected with its U.S. trade or business that
are deemed repatriated out of the United States.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A report issued in 2005 by the Joint Committee on Taxation contains a legislative proposal
that, if enacted, would treat a foreign corporation as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, and therefore subject to U.S. federal income tax on all of its income, if its primary
place of management and control is located within the United States. A corporation&#146;s primary place
of management and control would be where the executive officers and senior management of the
corporation exercise their day-to-day responsibility for the strategic, financial
 and operational policy decision making for the corporation. The proposal is proposed to be effective two years

Bermudian or holder of a permanent resident certificate) is available who meets the minimum
standards for the advertised position. The Bermuda government has a policy that limits the
duration of work permits to six years, subject to certain exemptions for key employees. A
significant number of our key officers, including our Chief Executive Officer, an executive vice
president and key reinsurance underwriters are working in Bermuda under work permits that will
expire over the next year. The Bermuda government could refuse to extend these work permits. If

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Item&nbsp;3. Legal Proceedings</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between May&nbsp;3, 2006 and June&nbsp;16, 2006, several class action lawsuits were filed against PXRE,
Jeffrey Radke, the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, and John Modin, the Company&#146;s former Chief
Financial Officer, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of a
putative class consisting of investors who purchased the publicly traded securities of PXRE between
July&nbsp;28, 2005 and February&nbsp;16, 2006. Each of the class action complaints asserts nearly identical
claims and alleges that during the purported class period certain PXRE executives made a series of
materially false and misleading statements or omissions about PXRE&#146;s business, prospects and
operations, thereby causing investors to purchase PXRE&#146;s securities at artificially inflated
prices, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the &#147;1934 Act&#148;), and Rule&nbsp;10b-5 promulgated under the 1934 Act. The class action complaints
allege, among other things, that the Company failed to disclose and misrepresented the following
material adverse facts: (1)&nbsp;the full impact on PXRE&#146;s business of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and
Wilma (the &#147;2005 Hurricanes&#148;); (2)&nbsp;the doubling of PXRE&#146;s cost of the 2005 Hurricanes to an
estimated $758&nbsp;million to $788&nbsp;million; and (3)&nbsp;the magnitude of the loss to PXRE and PXRE&#146;s
potential loss of its financial-strength and credit ratings from A.M. Best . Further, the
complaints allege, based on the foregoing asserted facts, that PXRE&#146;s statements with respect to
its loss estimates for the 2005 hurricane season lacked any reasonable basis. The class actions
seek an unspecified amount of damages, as well as other forms of relief. A motion to appoint a
lead plaintiff and consolidate all of the class actions into a single proceeding is currently
pending before the court.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;21, 2007, PXRE entered into a Tolling and Standstill Agreement with certain
institutional investors in connection with potential claims arising out of the Private Placement of
Series&nbsp;D Perpetual Non-voting Preferred Shares of PXRE that were sold pursuant to the Private
Placement Memorandum dated on or about September&nbsp;28, 2005.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Preferred Shares, the payment of dividends on the Company&#146;s common
shares is subject to the following limitations: (i)&nbsp;no dividend may be paid upon the common shares
if the dividends payable upon the Preferred Shares are overdue, (ii)&nbsp;the amount of dividends paid
with respect to the common shares may not be increased by a cumulative annualized rate of more than
10% at any time prior to April&nbsp;4, 2005 (the &#147;Permitted Dividend Amount&#148;) without the consent of the
majority of holders of the Preferred Shares; and (iii)&nbsp;at any time on or after April&nbsp;4, 2005, no
dividend may be paid that would result in payment of any dividend or other distribution with respect to common shares or result in a redemption, offer to purchase, tender offer or other
acquisition of capital shares of the Company involving consideration having an aggregate fair value
in excess of the greater of the Permitted Tender Offer Amount and the Permitted Dividend Amount.
For this purpose, the term &#147;Permitted Tender Offer Amount&#148; means an amount equal to 20% of the
cumulative amount by which our consolidated net income in any calendar year commencing with the
year ending December&nbsp;31, 2002 exceeds $50.0&nbsp;million minus the sum of all cash and the fair value of
all non-cash consideration paid in respect of redemptions, offers to purchase, tender offers or
other acquisitions of our capital shares on or after December&nbsp;10, 2001.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a holding company, the Company is dependent upon dividend payments from its subsidiaries,
including PXRE Bermuda and PXRE Reinsurance, to pay dividends to the Company&#146;s shareholders. PXRE
Bermuda is subject to Bermuda law, which may restrict its ability to distribute dividends. PXRE
Reinsurance is subject to the insurance laws of the State of Connecticut, which currently prohibit
the payment of any dividends without the prior approval of the Insurance Commissioner of the State
of Connecticut. <I>See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations &#150; Capital Resources&#148; and &#147;Business &#150; Regulation&#148; </I>for further information concerning
restrictions under Bermuda and U.S. law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Company&#146;s Bye-Laws, subject to certain exceptions and to waiver by the Company&#146;s
Board of Directors on a case by case basis, no transfer of the Company&#146;s shares is permitted if
such transfer would result in a shareholder owning, directly or indirectly, more than 9.9% of the
voting power of the outstanding shares, including common shares, of the Company or more than 9.9%
of the outstanding shares of any class of the Company&#146;s shares. Ownership is broadly defined in the
Company&#146;s Bye-Laws.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company may refuse to register any such transfer on the Company&#146;s share transfer records.
A transferee will be permitted to promptly dispose of any of the Company&#146;s shares purchased that
violate the restriction and as to the transfer of which registration is refused. The transferor of
such shares of the Company will be deemed to own such shares for dividend, voting and reporting
purposes until a transfer of such shares has been so registered.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in the event that the Company becomes aware of a shareholder owning more than
9.9% of the voting power of the Company&#146;s outstanding shares after a transfer of shares has been
registered, the Company&#146;s Bye-Laws provide that, subject to the same exceptions and waiver
procedures, the voting rights with respect to the shares of the Company owned by any such
shareholder will be limited to a voting power of 9.9%. The Board of Directors has determined to
waive this requirement with respect to Capital Z Financial Services Fund II, L.P. (including, for
such purpose, certain of its affiliates).

Convertible Voting Common Shares, Class&nbsp;B Convertible Voting Common Shares and Class&nbsp;C Convertible
Voting Common Shares.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each series, each Preferred Share, in whole or in part, is convertible at any time at the
option of the holder into Convertible Common Shares for such series. The number of Convertible
Common Shares per Preferred Share issuable upon any conversion will be determined by dividing a
liquidation preference for the series equal to the aggregate original purchase price of the
Preferred Shares plus accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, by the conversion price then in effect.
As of December&nbsp;31, 2006 the adjusted conversion price was $11.28.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversion price is subject to adjustment to avoid dilution in the event of
recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, consolidation, merger, amalgamation or other
similar event or an issuance of additional Common Shares in a private placement below the fair
market value or in a registered public offering below 95% of fair market value (in each case, fair
market value being the value immediately prior to the date of announcement of such issuance) or
without consideration. As a result of the issuance of 8,843,500 Common Shares in October&nbsp;2005 at
the price of $13.25 per share pursuant to a public offering of Common Shares and the issuance of
34,090,906 Common Shares upon the exchange of the Series&nbsp;D Preferred Shares at the exchange price
of $11.00 per share, the conversion price on the Preferred Shares was adjusted downwards by $1.75
in accordance with the terms of the underlying Share Purchase Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the conversion price is subject to adjustment, for certain loss and loss expense
development on reserves for losses incurred on or before September&nbsp;30, 2001 (and loss adjustment
expenses related thereto) and for any liability or loss arising out of pending material litigation
(other than legal fees and expenses), on an after-tax basis, equal to an amount computed in
accordance with a formula as set forth in the Description of Stock. Adjustments occur if the
development exceeds a deductible after-tax threshold of $7.0&nbsp;million and, with respect to all
reserves other than reserves for certain discontinued operations and the events of September&nbsp;11,
2001 and liability arising out of pending litigation, the adjustment is limited to $12.0&nbsp;million of
further development. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, PXRE has incurred $40.5&nbsp;million of net adverse
development above this $7.0&nbsp;million threshold. As a result of this, and the anti-dilution
adjustment discussed above, as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the adjusted conversion price was $11.28.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Series of Preferred Shares were sub-divided into two sub-series. On March&nbsp;31, 2005,
5,840.6 Series&nbsp;A1 convertible voting preferred shares, 3,143.6 Series&nbsp;B1 convertible voting
preferred shares and 1,393.6 Series&nbsp;C1 convertible voting preferred shares were mandatorily
converted into 4.4&nbsp;million class A convertible voting common shares, 2.4&nbsp;million
class B convertible voting common shares and 1.0&nbsp;million class C convertible voting common
shares, respectively. The conversion was effected based upon a conversion price of $13.27, which
conversion price was agreed between the Company and holders of the Company&#146;s convertible voting
preferred shares pursuant to a letter agreement dated as of March&nbsp;31, 2005. These shares were
originally scheduled to convert on April&nbsp;4, 2005, but in the interest of presenting a balance sheet
reflecting the conversion on March&nbsp;31, 2005, PXRE reached an agreement with the preferred
shareholders to convert four days early.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the proposed merger with Argonaut, the Preferred Shareholders have agreed
to consent to the merger, forego future dividends and convert their preferred shares into common shares upon the closing of

$11.28 to $6.24 provided that such reduction shall be null and void if the merger is not
consummated.

D Preferred Shares upon affirmative vote of the shareholders&#146; on November&nbsp;18, 2005. Except as
otherwise provided, each class of Convertible Common Shares shall have the same rights, preferences

common shares on a one-for-one basis upon a transfer of record ownership thereof to any person
other than the original purchasers, or any of their respective affiliates or limited partners
(including, without limitation, in connection with a public offering of such shares), or a person
approved by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion. Convertible Common Shares may be
converted at the option of the holder thereof into common shares on a one-for-one basis at any time
that such holder would be entitled to vote Preferred Shares generally in the election of directors
in accordance with the Description of Stock. Our Class&nbsp;IV directors are designated solely by
holders of our convertible common shares and preferred shares. The holders of convertible common
shares do not vote for any other class of directors.

Interpretation No.&nbsp;46 (revised December&nbsp;2003), &#147;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities&#148;

purpose trusts which issued PXRE&#146;s trust preferred securities. As a result, the subordinated
loans from the trusts are reflected as liabilities under</TD>

assets under the caption &#147;Other assets&#148; with a corresponding increase in liabilities under the
caption &#147;Subordinated debt.&#148; FIN 46R did not permit these changes to be made retroactively. In
addition, gains on the repurchase of $5.2&nbsp;million of PXRE&#146;s trust preferred securities in prior
periods of $1.1&nbsp;million, net of tax, that were previously accounted for as extinguishments of
debt, were reversed during the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2004 and presented as a cumulative effect

statement as a liability or an asset in some circumstances. PXRE adopted this statement
during the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2003; however, due to certain parts of this statement
being deferred by the FASB, the adoption of this statement did not have any impact on PXRE&#146;s
Consolidated Financial Statements, financial position or results of operations until the

    <TD>At January&nbsp;1, 2006, PXRE adopted the FASB SFAS No.&nbsp;123R, &#147;Share-Based Payment&#148; (&#147;SFAS 123R&#148;)
issued in December&nbsp;2004, using the modified prospective application method. SFAS 123R
establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its
equity instruments for goods or services and for transactions in which an entity obtains
employee services in share-based payment transactions. Under SFAS 123R, compensation costs
are recognized for the fair value of all share-based compensation over their remaining vesting
period, including the cost related to the unvested portion of all outstanding share-based
compensation as of December&nbsp;31, 2005. Previously, PXRE accounted for its share-based
compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of the Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25, &#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees&#148;, and related
Interpretations. No share-based compensation cost related to the options granted under the
plans was reflected in net income (loss)&nbsp;prior to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. PXRE&#146;s
adoption of SFAS 123R did not and has not had a material effect on net income.</TD>

    <TD>In September, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;158, &#147;Employers&#146; Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans&#148; (&#147;SFAS 158&#148;), an amendment of SFAS No.&nbsp;87, 88, 106 and
132R. This statement represents the completion of the first phase in the FASB&#146;s
postretirement benefits accounting project and requires an entity to recognize in its
statement of financial position an asset for a defined benefit postretirement plan&#146;s
overfunded status or a liability for a plan&#146;s underfunded status, measure a defined benefit
postretirement plan&#146;s assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of
the employer&#146;s fiscal year and recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit
postretirement plan in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. The
statement does not change the amount of net periodic benefit cost included in net income or
address the various measurement issues associated with postretirement benefit plan accounting.
PXRE adopted the portion of the statement which requires recognition of the funded status of
a defined benefit postretirement plan and the disclosure requirements as of December&nbsp;31, 2006.
The adoption of this statement resulted in PXRE recording a charge of $0.7&nbsp;million in
&#147;Accumulated other comprehensive loss&#148; in its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December&nbsp;31,
2006. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the
employer&#146;s fiscal year-end balance sheet is effective for fiscal years ending after December

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Overview</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE Group Ltd. is an insurance holding company organized in Bermuda. We provide reinsurance
products and services to a worldwide marketplace through our wholly owned subsidiary operations
located in Bermuda, Europe and the United States. Our primary business has been catastrophe and
risk excess reinsurance, which accounted for substantially all of our net premiums written for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;16, 2006, we announced that we would be increasing our estimates of the net
pre-tax impact of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma on our results of operations for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2005. We also announced our intention to explore strategic alternatives due to
concerns about the hurricane losses and the resulting potential negative impact on our credit
ratings. Following these announcements, in February&nbsp;2006 our counterparty credit and financial
strength ratings were downgraded by the major rating agencies to a level that was unacceptable to
many of our reinsurance clients. These ratings downgrades have had a significant negative impact
on our results of operations and profitability because they have impaired our ability to retain and
renew our existing reinsurance business. In light of the negative consequences of rating
downgrades, our Board of Directors determined that we should evaluate strategic alternatives to our
operating approach at that time and decided to retain Lazard (which has since been succeeded by
KBW) as a financial advisor to assist in the strategic exploration process.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the downgrade and withdrawal of our credit ratings in early 2006, we have not
underwritten any material new reinsurance contracts or renewed any of our expiring reinsurance
contracts. During 2006, most of our clients exercised their contractual rights to terminate their
reinsurance contracts with us as a result of the decline in our ratings and capital. In order to
manage our peak zone catastrophe exposures, the Company had also selectively allowed
extra-contractual cancellations on certain contracts that do not contain cancellation provisions
triggered by rating downgrades. As of January&nbsp;1, 2007, virtually all of our in-force assumed
reinsurance contracts had expired and we have no remaining material exposure to future catastrophe
events at that date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had net income before convertible preferred share dividends of $28.5&nbsp;million in 2006
compared to a net loss before convertible preferred share dividends of $697.6&nbsp;million in 2005. The
primary cause of the 2005 net loss was the net impact of catastrophe losses arising from

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Proposed Merger with Argonaut Group, Inc.</U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
March 14, 2007, the Board of Directors concluded its strategic alternative evaluation
process and announced that we had entered into a Merger Agreement with Argonaut. Pursuant to the
terms of the Merger Agreement, Argonaut will merge into a newly formed PXRE Group Ltd. subsidiary,
PXMS, Inc. Upon completion of the merger, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement which has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both companies, Argonaut
stockholders will receive subject to certain adjustments, 6.4672 PXRE common shares in exchange for each share of Argonaut common
stock. Upon closing of the transaction, approximately 73% of PXRE&#146;s outstanding common shares
will be owned by former Argonaut stockholders, and approximately 27% by former holders of PXRE&#146;s
common shares and convertible voting preferred shares. Argonaut stock options and other equity
awards will automatically convert upon completion of the merger into stock options and equity
awards with respect to PXRE common stock, subject to adjustment to reflect the exchange ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon completion of the merger, PXRE will be renamed &#147;Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd.&#148;
and its common shares will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and relisted on the NASDAQ.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completion of the merger, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2007, is subject
to various conditions, including (1)&nbsp;receipt of approvals of the holders of PXRE and Argonaut
common stock, (2)&nbsp;receipt of regulatory approvals, and (3)&nbsp;effectiveness of the Form S-4
registration statement relating to the PXRE common stock to be issued in the merger and (4)&nbsp;listing
of the PXRE common stock on the NASDAQ.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and Argonaut. Under
certain circumstances, including those relating to competing business combination proposals,
termination of the merger agreement could obligate PXRE to pay a termination fee of $20&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Argonaut underwrites specialty commercial insurance in niche areas of the property and
casualty insurance market. Argonaut offers property and casualty insurance products through eleven
wholly-owned insurance companies. Collectively, the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to write
insurance in all fifty states and in the District of Columbia, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands and
are authorized to write insurance on a surplus lines basis in all fifty states.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Argonaut targets niches in which it can develop a leadership position and which Argonaut
believes will generate underwriting profits. Argonaut has stated that its growth has been achieved
both organically through an operational strategy focused on underwriting discipline and as a result
of acquisition activity.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently with the announcement of the merger, we also announced the formation of a new
Bermuda based reinsurance subsidiary, Peleus Re. Peleus Re has been rated &#147;A-&#148;
by A.M. Best and is expected to begin writing reinsurance business. Peleus Re will focus on
underwriting medium to small commercial property reinsurance risks on a pro rata and risk excess
basis, and property catastrophe reinsurance risk on a controlled basis. It is also expected to
reinsure casualty risks; initially through a quota share of Argonaut&#146;s existing casualty business.
Peleus Re will initially be capitalized with $213&nbsp;million contributed from the existing surplus of
PXRE Bermuda. PXRE Bermuda and PXRE Reinsurance will be placed into an orderly runoff, but will
provide intercompany reinsurance support to Peleus Re.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors believes that the merger with Argonaut and resumption of reinsurance
business through Peleus Re will provide shareholders with an expected return that is superior to
both the potential value that shareholders would have realized if the Board of Directors had
elected to pursue other non-runoff alternatives considered during the strategic evaluation process
or the potential value that shareholders were likely to realize if the Company were to be
liquidated after the conclusion of an orderly runoff and winding up process.

McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., downgraded its counterparty credit and financial strength rating on
PXRE Reinsurance and PXRE Bermuda from &#147;A-&#148; to &#147;BBB&#043;&#148; and placed these ratings on CreditWatch with
negative implications. A.M. Best, an independent insurance industry rating organization, also
downgraded its financial strength rating from &#147;A-&#148; to &#147;B&#043;&#043;&#148; with a negative outlook. On February
17, 2006, Moody&#146;s downgraded its insurance financial strength rating of PXRE Reinsurance from
&#147;Baa1&#148; to &#147;Baa2&#148; and placed this rating under review for possible further downgrade.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;22, 2006, we announced our financial results for the quarter ended December&nbsp;31,
2005. We also announced a further increase in our estimates of the net pre-tax impact of
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. <I>See Item&nbsp;7 &#151; Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Comparison of 2005 with 2004 &#151; Losses and Loss

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently in February&nbsp;2006, S&#038;P further downgraded its counterparty credit and financial
strength rating on PXRE Reinsurance and PXRE Bermuda from &#147;BBB&#043;&#148; to &#147;BBB-&#148;. A.M. Best further
downgraded its financial strength rating on these entities from &#147;B&#043;&#043;&#148; to &#147;B&#043;&#148; with a negative
implication. Moody&#146;s further downgraded its insurance financial strength rating of PXRE
Reinsurance from &#147;Baa2&#148; to &#147;Baa3&#148; and placed this rating under review for possible further
downgrade. <I>See Item&nbsp;1 &#151; Business: Ratings.</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April, 2006, after finding that operational ratings below the critical &#147;A&#148; category
provided little value for a reinsurer, we announced that we had requested that the major credit
rating agencies withdraw their financial strength and claims paying ratings of the Company and its
operating subsidiaries. In the wake of this request, A.M. Best downgraded its financial strength
ratings of PXRE Reinsurance and PXRE Bermuda from &#147;B&#043;&#148; to &#147;B&#148; and withdrew these ratings; S&#038;P
downgraded its counterparty credit and financial strength rating on PXRE

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position
of reinsurance companies. Due to these ratings downgrades and withdrawal in 2006 of the
operational ratings of our reinsurance subsidiaries by A.M. Best, S&#038;P and Moody&#146;s, our competitive
position in the reinsurance industry has suffered, with ceding companies and brokers having moved
business to other reinsurers with higher ratings. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, virtually all of the
Company&#146;s reinsurance contracts had either been cancelled, non-renewed or expired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On

PXRE&#146;s business operations during 2006 and prior. As discussed above, our Board of Directors
entered into a Merger Agreement with Argonaut. For a discussion of Argonaut&#146;s business, see
Argonaut&#146;s Annual Report of Form 10-K for the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, which was filed with
the SEC on March&nbsp;1, 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We incurred net income before convertible preferred share dividends of $28.5&nbsp;million in 2006
compared to a net loss before convertible preferred share dividends of $697.6&nbsp;million in 2005. Our
profitability in 2006 was attributable to the low level of insured catastrophe activity, offset by
the significant reduction in our premium volume due to cancellation and inability to renew expiring
policies in the wake of our ratings downgrades. The primary cause of the 2005 net loss was the net
impact on our financial position and results of operations of catastrophe losses arising from
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma of $806.9&nbsp;million, after reinsurance recoveries on our outwards
reinsurance program and the impact of inwards and outwards reinstatements and additional premiums.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industry sources have estimated that Hurricane Katrina, which struck the United States on
August&nbsp;30, 2005, caused insured industry losses from $41&nbsp;billion to $60&nbsp;billion. Hurricane Rita,
which struck Texas on September&nbsp;24, 2005, caused another $4&nbsp;billion to $7&nbsp;billion in insured
industry losses according to these same industry sources. As a result of these hurricanes, we
reported a net loss before convertible preferred share dividends of $317.3&nbsp;million during the
quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2005.

opportunities, the Board of Directors implemented a capital raising plan that resulted in the
Company receiving net proceeds of $474.0&nbsp;million from two separate transactions as described below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated as of September&nbsp;29, 2005, we agreed to issue and
sell 375,000 Series&nbsp;D Preferred Shares in a private placement exempt from registration under the
Securities Act of 1933. The Series&nbsp;D Preferred Shares were mandatorily exchangeable for common
shares upon the shareholders&#146; approval of the exchange. The private placement closed on October&nbsp;7,
2005. The gross proceeds from the private placement were $375.0&nbsp;million and proceeds, net of
agents&#146; discounts and commissions and offering expenses, were $359.3&nbsp;million. The Series&nbsp;D
Preferred Shares were mandatorily exchanged into 34,090,906 common shares following the affirmative
vote of the Company&#146;s shareholders at a special general meeting held on November&nbsp;18, 2005 approving
the exchange of the Series&nbsp;D Preferred Shares and the authorization of an additional 300.0&nbsp;million
of our common shares. Shortly after the exchange, S&#038;P affirmed our &#147;A-&#148; financial strength rating
and assigned us a stable outlook.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;7, 2005, we also completed a public offering of 8,843,500 of our common shares
including 1,153,500 shares sold upon exercise of the underwriter&#146;s over-allotment option in full,
at a public offering price of $13.25 per share. Credit Suisse First Boston LLC acted as sole
underwriter in the offering. Net proceeds to the Company from the common stock offering, after
deducting estimated expenses and underwriter&#146;s discounts and commissions, were approximately $114.7
million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We contributed the net proceeds of both offerings to PXRE Bermuda to support the underwriting
of reinsurance business during subsequent renewal periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after the completion of the foregoing capital raising transactions, Hurricane Wilma
occurred, making landfall in Mexico on October&nbsp;21, 2005 and Florida on October&nbsp;24, 2005. Industry
sources have estimated that Hurricane Wilma caused insured industry losses from $8&nbsp;billion to $12
billion in Florida. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, the net impact of Hurricane Wilma on our financial
position and results of operations was $138.0&nbsp;million, after reinsurance recoveries on our outwards
reinsurance program and the impact of inwards and outwards reinstatements and additional premiums.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our December&nbsp;31, 2005&nbsp;year-end closing process, we reassessed our liability for
claims arising from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As part of this year-end assessment, we
determined that claims reported by clients relating to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were
significantly higher than expected, especially following a significant influx of reported claims in
late November through January&nbsp;2006. Our year-end assessment of Hurricane Katrina and Rita also
included a review of the loss information included in the underwriting submission information
provided by clients as part of the January&nbsp;1, 2006 renewal process. As a result of this year-end
review, we recorded an additional net liability in the fourth quarter
of $238.1 million with respect to Hurricane Katrina and $48.2&nbsp;million with respect to Hurricane Rita, in
each case net of reinsurance recoveries on our outwards reinsurance program and the impact of
inwards and outwards reinstatements and additional premiums.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new loss estimates resulted from the Company&#146;s assessment of new loss reports, as well as
notifications received by the Company subsequent to the ratings downgrades from two counterparties
exercising their rights claimed under certain of the Company&#146;s reinsurance contracts to cancel and
commute retrocessional coverage based on ratings downgrades and material changes to the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have exhausted our retrocessional coverage with respect to Hurricane Katrina, leaving us
exposed to further losses from Hurricane Katrina.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately ninety-five percent of our projected net ultimate incurred loss for Hurricanes
Katrina, Rita and Wilma has been formally reported to us as paid or case reserves. However, as of
December&nbsp;31, 2006, we have paid less than 60% of our net incurred loss amounts with respect to
these hurricanes. Accordingly, the liability for loss and loss expenses incurred with respect to
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma represents management&#146;s best estimate of our ultimate liability
for claims arising from these catastrophes. Our estimation of loss and loss expense liability
involves significant uncertainties and is based on complex and subjective judgments. Because of
the uncertainty in the process of estimating our losses from catastrophe events, there is a risk
that our liability for losses and loss expenses could prove to be inadequate, with a consequent
adverse impact on our future earnings and shareholders&#146; equity. <I>See below, Update on Critical
Accounting Policy Disclosures &#151; Estimation of Losses and Loss Expenses.</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our incurred loss for these events represents our best estimate, which is primarily based on
claims notices, modeling, a review of affected contracts by our underwriters and discussions with
our clients; however, some of our cedents who have incurred losses from multiple events, may have
the ability to choose which losses to cede, and as such, in future periods they may reallocate
losses among the 2005 events.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our reserve review process, we retained a nationally recognized actuarial firm to
perform a third party review of all of our liabilities for loss and loss adjustment expenses
annually since year end 2004. As a result of our internal actuarial review and third party review,
management believes that the estimate of our liability for unpaid loss and loss expenses as of
December&nbsp;31, 2006 is adequate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><I>Retrocessional Reinsurance Protection</I></U>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006, the Company purchased $482.3&nbsp;million of single event reinsurance and catastrophe bond
protection, including catastrophe bonds accounted for as reinsurance and as a derivative. This
compares to $245.5&nbsp;million purchased in 2005. Additionally, the amount of coverage available upon
the occurrence of a second catastrophe event in 2006 was $275.0&nbsp;million, compared to the 2005
amount of $25.0&nbsp;million. This increased limit purchased increased ceded premiums over prior
periods, exclusive of reinstatement and additional premiums. Our risk management program for our
2006 assumed reinsurance portfolio forecast that we would have significant gross premiums written
during 2006.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to better protect PXRE against the risk of another severe catastrophe event or the
occurrence of multiple significant catastrophe events, we sponsored two catastrophe bond
transactions that closed during the fourth quarter of 2005. The first transaction was a $300.0
million collateralized reinsurance agreement with Atlantic &#038; Western Re Limited (&#147;A&#038;W I&#148;), a Cayman
Island reinsurance company. This reinsurance coverage was designed to protect PXRE from extreme
catastrophe losses arising from hurricanes in the Eastern and Gulf coasts of the United States,
windstorms in northern Europe and earthquakes in California. This reinsurance provided two layers
of protection over the next 5&nbsp;years to PXRE. The first layer provides $200.0&nbsp;million of coverage
for losses arising from hurricanes in the Eastern and Gulf coasts of the United States, windstorms
in northern Europe and earthquakes in California. The second layer provided $100.0&nbsp;million of
coverage for losses arising from hurricanes in the Eastern and Gulf coasts of the United States and
windstorms in northern Europe.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reinsurance coverage provided by A&#038;W I was based on a modeled loss trigger. PXRE created
a series of notional portfolios of reinsurance contracts designed to closely mimic the expected
exposures in PXRE&#146;s assumed reinsurance portfolio. Upon the occurrence of a hurricane, windstorm
or earthquake in the covered territories, the parameters of the catastrophe event are determined
and modeled against the notional portfolios. If the modeled loss to the notional portfolio
exceeded the attachment point for the peril at issue, then PXRE would have made a recovery under
the reinsurance agreement. The recovery was limited to PXRE&#146;s ultimate net loss from the loss
event. PXRE has the right to reset the notional portfolios after three years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;8, 2005, A&#038;W I financed the reinsurance coverage through the issuance and sale of
$300.0&nbsp;million in catastrophe bonds pursuant to Rule&nbsp;144A under the Securities Act of 1933.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to have realized any benefit from the coverage provided under the A&#038;W I reinsurance
agreement, PXRE would need to incur significant losses from a catastrophe event. Since the
downgrades and withdrawal of PXRE&#146;s credit ratings in early 2006, PXRE has not underwritten any new
reinsurance contracts or renewed any of its expiring reinsurance contracts. Effective as of
January&nbsp;1, 2007, virtually all of PXRE&#146;s in-force assumed reinsurance contracts had expired and
PXRE has no remaining material exposure to future catastrophe events. The Board of Directors of
PXRE Group Ltd. concluded that it was unlikely that PXRE Group Ltd. would ultimately pursue a
strategic alternative that would allow PXRE to utilize the coverage available under the A&#038;W I
reinsurance agreement in light of the extremely high attachment point under such reinsurance
agreement. Accordingly, on February&nbsp;8, 2007, PXRE did not pay the premium due to A&#038;W I. The
non-payment is expected to result in an event of default under the A&#038;W I reinsurance agreement,
which will trigger the early commutation of such reinsurance agreement. As a result of the early
commutation of the Reinsurance Agreement, PXRE recorded termination charges of approximately $17.6
million in its December&nbsp;31, 2006 consolidated financial statements. This amount is reflected as a
reduction to net premium earned in the Company&#146;s consolidated statement of operations and
comprehensive operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second transaction was a $250.0&nbsp;million collateralized transaction with Atlantic &#038; Western
Re II Limited (&#147;A&#038;W II&#148;), a Cayman Island reinsurance company, which is accounted for as a
derivative. It is designed to provide coverage to PXRE for second
event losses in the same calendar year arising from hurricanes in the Eastern and Gulf coasts of the United
States, windstorms in northern Europe and earthquakes in California. The agreement with A&#038;W II
provides two tranches of protection to PXRE for the risk that a second significant catastrophe loss
arising from a hurricane in the Eastern and Gulf coasts of the United States, a windstorm in
northern Europe or earthquake in California occurs following the occurrence of a first significant
hurricane, windstorm or earthquake loss. The coverage provided $250.0&nbsp;million of protection for
the period from January&nbsp;1, 2006 to December&nbsp;31, 2006 and provides $125.0&nbsp;million for the period
from January&nbsp;1, 2007 to December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The A&#038;W II coverage is based on a modeled loss trigger. PXRE created a series of notional

catastrophe event in the covered territories during the same calendar year, the parameters of the
catastrophe event are determined and modeled against the notional portfolios. If the modeled loss
to the notional portfolio for the second event exceeds the attachment point for the peril at issue,
then PXRE will make a recovery under the agreement. The recovery is based on modeled losses and,
unlike A&#038;W I, is not limited to PXRE&#146;s ultimate net losses from the loss event.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reinsurance companies that are the counterparties to these transactions are variable
interest entities under the provisions of FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;46, &#147;Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities&#148; (&#147;FIN 46R&#148;). The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these entities and
is therefore not required to consolidate these entities in its consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Board of Directors elects to pursue a strategic alternative that materially changes
PXRE&#146;s catastrophe risk profile, we may seek to assign or novate PXRE&#146;s rights and obligations
under the A&#038;W II collateralized catastrophe facility to another insurance or reinsurance company.
There can be no assurance that any other insurance or reinsurance company would be willing to
accept such an assignment or novation, that the note holders who funded the facilities would
consent to such an assignment or novation, or that the cost of such an assignment or novation would
not have a material adverse impact on PXRE. If PXRE was not able to successfully assign or novate
its rights and obligations under this collateralized catastrophe facility, PXRE could incur
material termination fees and liabilities. If the A&#038;W II facility is terminated prior to the end
of the scheduled termination date, these fees could be as much as $5.8&nbsp;million, and PXRE is
obligated to make all premium payments up to the date of termination.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has also purchased additional retrocessional reinsurance coverage at various
retention levels in addition to the coverage obtained in the above noted catastrophe bond
transactions. If the Board of Directors elects to pursue a strategic alternative that materially
changes PXRE&#146;s catastrophe risk profile, the Company will also need to evaluate its obligations
under two multi-year ceded reinsurance contracts that provide the
Company with reinsurance protection against catastrophic events in 2007 and 2008. In this regard, the Company will
need to evaluate whether it is likely that catastrophe loss exposure assumed by PXRE in 2007 and
2008 has the potential to result in losses that exceed the retention level under these ceded
reinsurance protections. The Company is currently obligated to cede reinsurance premiums of $15.0
million per annum in each of 2007 and 2008 under these multi-year contracts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Overview of Our Business</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a reinsurer, we generated income primarily through the premiums from clients who purchased
our reinsurance contracts and the investment income generated by our portfolio of invested assets.
Our primary expenses are the losses incurred under our reinsurance contracts, commissions and
brokerage paid to reinsurance brokers who place reinsurance contracts with us, our general
operating expenses such as salaries and rent, and interest expense on our debt. The two largest
variables that determine the profitability of our business from period to period are generally the
amount of premiums generated and the size of losses incurred.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we are able to implement a strategic alternative that would allow us to provide clients
with an acceptably rated counterparty, we do not anticipate being able to underwrite any material
amount of new reinsurance business in 2007 and would therefore not be able to generate any material
amount of net premiums earned during 2007. The reduction in premium income has and will have a
material adverse effect on our future operating results, liquidity and financial condition. Net
premiums earned were our primary source of revenue for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005,
accounting for 61% and 92% of our revenue, respectively. In 2006 and 2005, revenue from
non-premium sources was not sufficient to offset operating expenses and interest expenses. We
therefore expect to incur net operating losses in future periods unless we are successful in
executing a strategic alternative other than runoff. If such operating losses were to occur, this
would result in a decline in our shareholders&#146; equity. However, we currently expect that our
portfolio of short duration high credit quality fixed income securities, totaling $671.2&nbsp;million as
of December&nbsp;31, 2006, will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the currently foreseen needs of our
counterparties.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We disclose our significant accounting policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Certain of these policies are critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and
results since they require management to establish estimates based on complex and subjective
judgments. Our critical accounting policies include the estimation of losses and loss expenses,
estimation and recognition of premiums, valuation of investments and valuation of deferred tax
asset.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Estimation of Losses and Loss Expenses</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a property catastrophe reinsurer, incurred losses are inherently more volatile than those
of primary insurers and reinsurers of risks that have an established historical pattern of losses.
In addition, with respect to insured events that occur near the end of a reporting period, as well
as with respect to our retrocessional book of business, the significant delay in losses being
reported to insurance carriers, reinsurers and finally
retrocessionaires require us to make estimates of losses based on limited information from our clients, industry loss estimates and
our own underwriting data. Because of the uncertainty in the process of estimating our losses from
insured events, there is a risk that our liabilities for losses and loss expenses could prove to be
inadequate, with a consequent adverse impact on our earnings and shareholders&#146; equity in future
periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In establishing our loss and loss expense liabilities, PXRE records reserves as management&#146;s
best estimate of liabilities as of the balance sheet date. Management believes that the Company&#146;s
estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses as of December&nbsp;31, 2006 is adequate. Since
year-end 2004, all of our loss and loss expense estimates have been reviewed annually by an
independent internationally recognized actuarial firm, and their conclusions have not, in any
period, been materially different than those of the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Significant Uncertainties</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most significant uncertainty in our reserves involves our estimates of catastrophe losses.
In reserving for catastrophe losses, our estimates are influenced by underwriting information
provided by our clients, industry catastrophe models, industry loss estimates and our internal
analyses of this information. This reserving approach can cause significant development from
initial loss estimates in the immediate wake of a catastrophe event due to the limited information
available to us as a reinsurer and retrocessionaire regarding the actual underlying losses. This
process can cause our ultimate estimates to differ significantly from initial projections.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, there has been significant variability in the development of catastrophe losses
during the twelve month period immediately following the catastrophe event with such variability
reducing after the initial twelve month period. To further illustrate the variability of setting
catastrophe loss estimates, the following chart outlines the changes in the initial loss estimates
for recent costly catastrophes in the United States over a three-year period based on industry
insured loss:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Reserving Methodologies</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We establish loss and loss expense liabilities (to cover expenses related to settling claims,
including legal and other fees) to provide for the ultimate cost of settlement and administration
of claims for losses, including claims that have been reported to us by our reinsureds and claims
for losses that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For reported losses, we establish reserves (liabilities for formally reported claims) when we
receive notice of the claim, which we refer to as case reserves. It is our general policy to
establish liabilities for reported losses in an amount equal to the liability set by the reinsured.
In certain but infrequent instances, such as the receipt of inconsistent, incorrect or inadequate
supporting documentation, we will conduct an investigation to determine if the amount established
by the reinsured is appropriate or if it should be adjusted in the form of an additional case
reserve.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE also records reserves for losses that have been incurred but not yet reported, which are
referred to as IBNR reserves. For IBNR reserves, a variety of methods have been developed in the
insurance industry and are generally accepted for use in determining the appropriate provision for
such liabilities. In general, these methods involve the extrapolation of reported loss data to
estimate ultimate losses. Our loss calculation methods generally rely upon a projection of
ultimate losses based upon the historical patterns of reported loss development.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our methods for establishing loss and loss expense liabilities vary depending upon the nature
of the losses, which can generally be divided into three categories: (1)&nbsp;non-catastrophe losses in
our catastrophe and risk excess segment, (2)&nbsp;catastrophe losses in our catastrophe and risk excess
segment, and (3)&nbsp;losses in our exited lines segment. The Company generally considers reserves for
each of these categories to be &#147;mature&#148; as follows (1)&nbsp;for non-catastrophe losses in our
catastrophe and risk excess segment, generally anywhere between eighteen and thirty-six months
after the accident year, (2)&nbsp;for catastrophe losses in our catastrophe and risk excess segment,
generally anywhere between six to twelve months after the event occurs, and (3)&nbsp;losses in our
exited lines segment, depending upon the nature of the underlying business, generally anywhere from
five to seven years after the accident year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;Non-Catastrophe Losses
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reserving for non-catastrophe losses in our catastrophe and risk excess segment, we use
three different methods to estimate IBNR reserves: the loss ratio method; the incurred
Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, which we refer to as the BF method; and the incurred loss development
method, the latter two of which are &#147;loss development approaches.&#148; Initially, at the inception of
an accident year, when there is little reported loss information, we use the loss ratio method.
This method computes IBNR, as the product of an expected loss ratio and assumed earned premium
minus reported loss to date. The expected loss ratio is primarily established for each line of
business based on the Company&#146;s historical loss ratios. In determining the expected loss ratio, we
also consider information provided by our clients and estimates provided by our underwriters and
actuaries concerning the impact of pricing and coverage changes. As the accident year matures
further and reported loss activity begins to emerge (usually at the end of the second or third
quarter following the loss) we change to the BF method.
</DIV>

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BF method is a premium based method of computing IBNR which blends the loss ratio method
with the loss development method. The BF method computes IBNR for an accident year as the product
of expected loss (earned premium multiplied by an expected loss ratio) and an expected percentage
of unreported losses. This expected percentage of unreported loss is a function of the loss
development factors developed by our corporate actuaries from our annual analysis of the Company&#146;s
historical loss development patterns by line of business. As experience emerges and accident years
mature further (generally eighteen to thirty-six months after the accident year given the
short-tailed nature of these property reinsurance lines) we transition to the incurred loss
development method, which relies solely on our clients&#146; reported loss information and indicated
historical loss development patterns to estimate ultimate losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other alternate loss reserving methods developed in the insurance industry include the paid
loss development method and the paid Bornhuetter-Ferguson method. We do not use these methods to
establish our IBNR reserves. We believe that incurred loss methods are more reliable because they
rely on a much larger, more stable and credible source of information, which is not influenced by
the occurrence of one or more large payments. We do, however, use these alternate loss reserving
methods to evaluate the reasonableness of the IBNR reserves that we establish using the incurred
loss methods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our loss development factors and expected loss ratios are monitored regularly and updated as
appropriate but at least once a year. These are the key assumptions that materially affect our
estimates for reserves for losses and loss expenses. The expected loss ratio is primarily
established for each line of business based on the Company&#146;s historical loss ratios. In
determining the expected loss ratio, we also consider information provided by our clients and
estimates provided by our underwriters and actuaries concerning the impact of pricing and coverage
changes. Loss development factors are developed from our annual analysis of our Company&#146;s
historical loss development patterns by line of business. These key assumptions did not materially
change from December&nbsp;31, 2005 to December&nbsp;31, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;Catastrophe Losses
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reserving for catastrophe losses in our catastrophe and risk excess segment, there is
initially little reported loss information in the immediate wake of a catastrophe event, as was the
case with the 2005 Hurricanes, Katrina, Rita and Wilma (&#147;KRW&#148;). The loss estimation process begins
with the identification of events with characteristics similar to the recent catastrophe
(geographic location, wind speed, damageability etc.), which then results in a list of the expected
losses by contract from our proprietary risk management system. Third party modeling software is
embedded in our proprietary risk management system.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently, our underwriting team performs a thorough contract by contract analysis to
identify potential changes to the expected loss estimates including IBNR by contract. With respect
to the 2005 Hurricanes, our underwriters&#146; estimates were subject to a high level of uncertainty.
Specifically for Hurricane Katrina, this high level of uncertainty arose out of extremely complex
and unique causation and coverage issues, including the appropriate attribution of losses to wind
or flood damage as opposed to other perils such as fire, business interruption or civil commotion.
In order to address these uncertainties, at that time, for contracts exposed to Hurricane Katrina
losses in our most volatile lines of business (retrocessional and direct and facultative reinsurance) we posted reserves for a significant
percentage of occurrence limits as of December&nbsp;31, 2005. These lines of business represented
approximately 60% of our gross loss amount on Hurricane Katrina. The underwriters&#146; knowledge of
the clients&#146; underlying books of business is considered in establishing loss estimates by contract.
The combination of catastrophe modeling and underwriting review of affected contracts then forms
the basis of our initial loss estimates for catastrophe losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the limited loss data available from clients in the wake of catastrophes, our
actuary uses our most current internally generated catastrophe loss development factors to assess
the reasonableness and adequacy of our catastrophe loss reserves in the immediate wake of a
catastrophe. These significant catastrophe loss development factors reflect the historical
variability of prior catastrophe loss reserves in the industry and PXRE&#146;s specific experience.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of this initial process are updated when additional information is available.
This information comes in the form of publicly available announcements, informal contact with
brokers and/or clients, submission data and formal claim notices. As catastrophic events mature
and reporting loss methods become more credible (usually six to twelve months after the event)
actuarial methods implementing historical patterns can be assigned more credibility. In evaluating
the loss estimates for catastrophic events, our actuaries utilize our internal database to
establish projected reporting patterns and payment patterns. This database includes data dating
back to the 1980&#146;s consisting of well over one hundred catastrophic events, of which over twenty
are hurricanes. Our actuary also employs industry patterns from the Reinsurance Association of
America, an insurance industry organization. Using this information, we have developed loss
development factors for significant catastrophes. Our internal significant catastrophe loss
development factors are analyzed as appropriate and at least once per year to reflect updated
industry benchmarks and changes in PXRE&#146;s specific loss history. The volume of reported loss
activity in interim quarterly periods is monitored by the Company to determine consistency with
expected loss activity based on PXRE and industry historical patterns. For individual storms, PXRE
specific loss development factors are applied to reported losses to estimate IBNR reserves.
However these may be weighted with industry factors or judgmental adjustments for individual
significant catastrophes based upon the nature of the particular catastrophe and the underwriters&#146;
knowledge.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This catastrophe reserving process can cause our ultimate estimates to differ significantly
from initial projections. For example, as part of our year-end closing process for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2005, we reassessed our ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses arising from
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. During the course of our 2005&nbsp;year-end assessment, we
increased our estimate of the ultimate incurred gross losses and loss expenses arising from
Hurricane Katrina by $214.6&nbsp;million to $771.0&nbsp;million and from Hurricane Rita by $48.1&nbsp;million to
$68.9&nbsp;million, in each case as compared to the gross incurred losses recorded as of September&nbsp;30,
2005. Our initial loss estimates for each of the hurricanes were based, in part, on insured
industry loss estimates for each event, catastrophe modeling, preliminary discussions with clients
and a review of potentially exposed contracts by our underwriters. In our 2005&nbsp;year-end assessment
of the liability for the 2005 hurricane losses, we determined that claims reported by clients
relating to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were significantly higher than expected, especially
following a significant influx of reported claims from late November&nbsp;2005 to February&nbsp;2006. In
part, the additional claims arose from a reassessment by clients of their original loss estimates
for the hurricane events. For example, various clients, who advised our underwriters in the
immediate wake of the hurricanes that they did not expect to experience significant losses to the
reinsurance contracts in the upper layers of their reinsurance programs, reassessed their losses
and submitted notices of claim for the contracts that they had previously indicated would not be
impacted by the catastrophes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in reviewing underwriting information provided by clients during December&nbsp;2005 as
part of the January&nbsp;1, 2006 renewal process, we found that certain clients were anticipating higher
losses from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita than had been reported through the formal claims channels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, our estimate of ultimate incurred net losses and loss expenses
arising from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma is $851.2&nbsp;million. Approximately ninety-five
percent of our projected net ultimate incurred loss for these hurricanes has been formally reported
to us as paid or case reserves. However, as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, we have paid less than 60% of
our net incurred loss amounts with respect to these hurricanes. Initially, our estimate of the
ultimate liability arising from these catastrophes was based on preliminary claims notices received
from clients, catastrophe modeling, a review of exposed reinsurance contracts, discussions with
numerous clients and a review of the underwriting information provided by clients with reinsurance
contracts that renewed as of January&nbsp;1, 2006. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, these events are reasonably
mature to extrapolate projected ultimate loss based on historical reporting patterns, both industry
and company specific. Our estimates fall within a reasonable actuarial range produced by these
methods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, specifically for Hurricane Katrina, our estimates are subject to a high level of
uncertainty arising out of extremely complex and unique causation and coverage issues, including
the appropriate attribution of losses to wind or flood damage as opposed to other perils such as
fire, business interruption or civil commotion. The underlying personal lines policies generally
contain exclusions for flood damage; however, water damage caused by wind may be covered. We
expect that causation and coverage issues may not be resolved for a considerable period of time and
may be influenced by evolving legal and regulatory developments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our actual losses from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma may exceed our best estimate as a
result of, among other things, the receipt of additional information from clients, the attribution
of losses to coverages that for the purpose of our estimates we assumed would not be exposed, and
inflation in repair costs due to the limited availability of labor and materials, in which case our
financial results could be further materially adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing our best estimate for Hurricane Katrina, we have also assumed flood damage
exclusions contained in our cedent&#146;s underlying insurance policies will be effective. We
understand that various lawsuits are pending seeking to invalidate such flood damage exclusions on
various grounds. If such lawsuits were to successfully invalidate the underlying flood damage
exclusions or if the court or a jury were to find that an insurer had not adequately established
that a loss was attributable to flood rather than wind, our liabilities for losses and loss
expenses relating to Hurricane Katrina could prove to be inadequate, with a consequent adverse
impact on our earnings and shareholders&#146; equity in future periods. Based on reports in the press,
we understand that State Farm, one of the nation&#146;s largest
insurers, has been engaging in various settlement discussions concerning claims involving the controversies over the flood exclusion.
We do not reinsure State Farm, but it is unclear at this time how any potential settlements by
State Farm would impact or influence our cedents.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If clients report increased losses this may not result in a linear increase in PXRE&#146;s
assumed loss position as the Company&#146;s IBNR may cover such increases. In addition, the results are
showing limited amounts of development at the various FGU percentages presented for certain lines
of business due to the fact that as ground up losses are increased, an increasing number of
underlying contracts have reached their contractual limits. Additionally, total losses are shown
excluding risk excess business as this line primarily involves commercial exposures and is not
expected to experience material development due to adverse personal lines litigation results in
Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;Exited Lines Segment Losses
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reserving for losses on our exited lines segment, there is great uncertainty due to its
composition of casualty and finite businesses, which produce losses that are slower to be reported
and paid than the property losses of our catastrophe and risk excess segment. Moreover, given our
limited experience in the casualty and finite businesses, we do not have established historical
loss development patterns that can be used to estimate these loss liabilities. We must therefore
rely on the historical loss development patterns reported by our clients and industry loss
development data in estimating our liabilities including IBNR. Accident years for this segment
take a longer period of time to &#147;mature&#148; than for our catastrophe and risk excess segment,
therefore, we primarily utilize the loss ratio method and BF method to establish our initial exited
lines loss estimates including IBNR. When the amount of reported losses become a more reliable
means for setting reserve estimates, generally five to seven years after the relevant accident
year, PXRE places more weight on these reported losses to estimate its loss reserves including IBNR
and less weight on the BF method.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Additional Uncertainties</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE has historically been involved in very few disputes with ceding companies, especially
those that enter into contracts that the Company includes in its catastrophe and risk excess
segment; nevertheless contract disputes in the property casualty reinsurance industry have
increased in recent years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an additional risk of uncertainty in PXRE&#146;s estimation of losses due to the fact that
PXRE writes only reinsurance business and no insurance business. As a result, losses, unearned
premiums and premiums written are all recorded based on reports received from the ceding companies.
PXRE does not receive loss information from the underlying insureds; however, because the
Company&#146;s reinsurance business focuses on short-tail lines such as property catastrophe,
retrocessional property catastrophe, risk-excess and aerospace, the delay from the time of the
underlying loss to the report date to PXRE is not as significant a risk as it would be if the
Company underwrote a significant amount of casualty business. However, with respect to insured
events that occur near the end of a reporting period, as well as with respect to our retrocessional
book of business, a delay in losses being reported to insurance carriers, reinsurers and finally
retrocessionaires may require us to make estimates of losses based on limited information from our
clients, industry loss estimates and our own underwriting data.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a system of controls in place that assists us in evaluating the completeness of the
data received from cedents. PXRE derives almost all of its business from reinsurance
intermediaries. As a result, the ceding company reports claims to the intermediary and the
intermediary in turn reports the data to all the reinsurers included in the underlying program.
Controls in place require that certain claims must be approved by the underwriter or a member of
senior management to validate the reported loss data before recorded as a case reserve. The
underwriter, based on his knowledge and judgment, may question the broker or ceding company if he
did not expect a loss of a certain magnitude to impact a certain layer. Because many of PXRE&#146;s
losses are from events that are well known, such as large hurricanes and earthquakes, the
underwriter may in fact expect losses to pierce certain layers and therefore would not question the
accuracy of such loss reports. If the underwriter does question the loss data, PXRE may perform
audits at the underlying ceding company in order to determine the accuracy of the amounts ceded.
PXRE&#146;s risk management and underwriting systems provide a list of impacted or potentially impacted
contracts by peril and by geographic zone. This assists PXRE in determining the completeness of
losses, as we will contact intermediaries and the ceding companies for which we believe underlying
contracts are impacted subsequent to an event to request information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, PXRE does not have any backlog related to the processing of assumed reinsurance
information. When a large loss occurs, the Company shifts personnel from various functions to
assist the claims personnel in the processing and evaluation of claims data.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an overall basis, the low and high ends of our selected range of reasonable net loss
and loss expense reserves are $33.6&nbsp;million below and $49.8&nbsp;million above the $567.9&nbsp;million best
estimate. The range around the overall estimate is not the sum of the ranges about the component
segments due to the impact of diversification when the reserve levels are considered in total. The
impact of diversification reflects the fact that not all lines with very low correlations are
expected to develop well or poorly at the same time.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2005 Hurricanes, the range was calculated by varying key assumptions regarding
PXRE and industry loss reporting patterns. A low end was suggested by assuming one month
acceleration around expected historical patterns. A high end was suggested by analyzing PXRE
monthly reporting patterns exhibited by the 2004 Florida Hurricanes with the assumption that this
composite event may serve as a proxy for the 2005 Hurricanes. A selected range of $15.0&nbsp;million
below and $30.0&nbsp;million above our net carried reserves was determined in the aggregate for all
three events combined, after considering the sensitivity analysis outlined above, our best loss
estimates, and actuarial judgment. This range of reasonable estimates does not represent a range
of all possible outcomes, but it is intended to reflect the inherent variability in actuarial
reserving methodologies. Assuming the flood exclusion is effective, we believe that results
outside this range are unlikely, and can not assign probabilities with certainty to any points
within this range.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the remainder of our carried loss and loss expense liabilities, we used a statistical
model to simulate a range of results about our best estimates assuming probability distributions
believed to reasonably reflect potential for favorable and unfavorable loss development. The
simulation results indicate that a five percent probability exists that the net loss reserves will
be below the low estimate and a five percent probability exists that the net loss reserves will be
above the high estimate. However, no assurance can be given that our ultimate losses will not be
significantly different than the simulation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low end and high end of the range of reasonable net loss and loss expense reserves around
the best estimate have decreased from December&nbsp;31, 2005 principally because of the reduction in the
Company&#146;s net loss reserve amount due to the payment of claims during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2006, as well as the passage of time since the occurrences of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma
and the resulting increase in formal loss reports and decrease in actuarial variability surrounding
the best estimate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Estimation and Recognition of Premiums</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our premiums on reinsurance business assumed are recorded as earned evenly over the contract
period based upon estimated subject premiums. PXRE&#146;s assumed premium is comprised of both minimum
and deposit premium and an estimate of premium. Minimum and deposit premium is billed and
collected in accordance with the provisions of the contracts and is usually billed quarterly or semi-annually. A premium estimate is also recorded if the
estimate of the ultimate premium is greater than the minimum and deposit premium. The final or
ultimate premium for most contracts is the product of the provisional rate and the ceding company&#146;s
subject net earned premium income (&#147;SNEPI&#148;). Because this portion of the premium is reasonably
estimable, the Company records and recognizes it as revenue over the period of the contract in the
same manner as the minimum and deposit premium. The key assumption related to the premium estimate
is the estimate of the amount of the ceding company&#146;s SNEPI, which is a significant element of
PXRE&#146;s overall underwriting process. Because of the inherent uncertainty in this process, there is
the risk that premiums and related receivable balances may turn out to be higher or lower than
reported.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated premium receivable, net of commission and brokerage, included in &#147;Premiums
receivable, net&#148; on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December&nbsp;31, 2006 of $93.3&nbsp;million, is $75.1
million, including assumed reinstatement premiums of $69.5&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We record an allowance for doubtful accounts that we believe approximates the exposure for all
potential uncollectible assets, after considering other balances that mitigate the exposure.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premiums on reinsurance business ceded are recorded as incurred evenly over the contract
period. Certain ceded reinsurance contracts contain provisions requiring us to pay additional
premiums or reinstatement premiums in the event that losses of a significant magnitude are ceded
under such contracts. Under GAAP, we are not permitted to establish reserves for these potential
additional premiums until a loss occurs that would trigger the obligation to pay such additional or
reinstatement premiums. As a result, the net amount recoverable from our reinsurers in the event
of a loss may be reduced by the payment of additional premiums and reinstatement premiums.
Frequently, the impact of such premiums will be offset by additional premiums and reinstatement
premiums payable to us by our clients on our assumed reinsurance business. No assurance can be
given; however, that assumed reinstatement and additional premiums will offset ceded reinstatement
and additional premiums. For example, in the case of the September&nbsp;11, 2001 terrorist attacks, our
net premiums earned during 2001 were reduced by $26.3&nbsp;million as a result of net additional
premiums and reinstatement premiums. In the case of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma our net
premiums earned were increased by $43.9&nbsp;million in 2005 as a result of net additional premiums and
reinstatement premiums.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assumed reinstatement premiums that reinstate coverage are written and earned at the time the
associated loss event occurs. Under the contract terms of certain of our excess of loss contracts,
reinstatement premiums are mandatorily due PXRE following a ceding company&#146;s loss, based on
pre-defined contract terms. Terms principally include a pro-rata amount of the original contract
premium relative to the proportion of the contractual limit exhausted by the associated loss,
without respect to time remaining in the term of the original limit, that is, the amount due is
100% as to time and pro-rata as to amount. Less frequently, terms can vary to incorporate a
percentage of the original premium that is more or less than the original premium or can be
pro-rata as to time remaining in the term of the original limit.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We accrue assumed reinstatement premiums based upon contract terms applied to the amount
estimated to settle ultimate incurred losses. The primary factor that could affect our estimate of
assumed reinstatement premiums is management&#146;s best estimate of ultimate incurred losses. <I>See
&#147;Critical Accounting Policy Disclosures &#151; Estimation of Losses and Loss Expenses&#148; </I>with regards to
the uncertainty, historical accuracy and sensitivity of this estimate. While premiums stated
relative to limit (&#147;rates on line&#148;) have an effect on the estimate of assumed reinstatement
premiums, those associated with case reserves are based on actual contract rate on line terms, and
those estimates associated with IBNR are based on weighted average rate on line terms of the book
of business for a given underwriting year by line of business. Therefore the primary factor that
could change our estimate of assumed reinstatement premium is management&#146;s best estimate of
ultimate incurred losses and the mix of treaties along with their respective rate on lines that
ultimately incur losses. Assumed reinstatement premiums receivable are settled on a net basis when loss payments are made to cedents. Accordingly, there is an
insignificant amount of credit risk associated with this asset as of any given period end date.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Valuation of Investments</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair values for our investments in hedge funds and other privately held fixed income
securities generally are established on the basis of the valuations provided monthly or quarterly
by the managers of such investments. These valuations generally are determined based upon the
valuation criteria established by the governing documents of such investments or utilized in the
normal course of such manager&#146;s business. Such valuations may differ significantly from the values
that would have been used had readily available markets existed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hedge funds and other limited partnership investments are accounted for under the equity
method whereby both the investment income and any change in the fair value are recorded through the
net investment income line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Operations. The fair value of hedge funds approximates redemption values. Foreign denominated
fixed maturities are accounted for as part of a trading portfolio, whereby both the investment
income and a portion of the change in the fair value are recorded through the net investment income
line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We utilize the valuations provided to us by managers of our hedge funds and other privately
held fixed income securities in preparing our financial statements. The carrying values used in
such financial statements may not reflect the value we receive when liquidating our investment in a
hedge fund or other privately held security. If liquidity is by redemption, the valuations
supplied quarterly by the manager of the hedge fund or other privately held security will generally
be the values used by the manager to set the redemption prices. However, to the extent a manager
has discretion in pricing holdings, should substantial redemptions occur in a limited period of
time, that discretion may be used to price at lower values than would otherwise be used, thus
reducing the redemption price. If liquidation of our investment occurs by virtue of a liquidation
of a hedge fund or other privately held securities, we may receive substantially less than the
valuation method used by the manager because the valuation method used by the manager is unlikely
to use liquidation values. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of our hedge fund and other
privately held investments does not necessarily represent the amount that could be realized upon
future sale, including in the event we need liquidity to fund catastrophic losses or loss payments.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We regularly monitor the difference between the estimated fair values of our investments and
their cost or book values to identify underperforming investments and whether declines in value are
temporary in nature, or &#147;other than temporary.&#148; If we believe a decline in the value of a
particular investment is temporary, we record the decline as an unrealized loss, net of tax, in
other comprehensive operations as a separate component of
shareholders&#146; equity. If we believe the decline is &#147;other than temporary,&#148; we write down the carrying value of the investment and
record a realized loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Operations.
We formally review each quarter the unrealized losses by value, and all investments that have been
in an unrealized loss position for more than six months. In assessing whether an investment is
suffering a decline in value that is &#147;other than temporary&#148; we pay particular attention to those
trading at 80% or less of original cost, and those investments that have been downgraded by any of
the major ratings agencies, general market conditions, and the status of principal and interest
payments. If we conclude that a decline is &#147;other than temporary,&#148; we recognize a realized
investment loss for the impairment. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, PXRE
recorded $7.3&nbsp;million and $11.8&nbsp;million, respectively, in &#147;other than temporary&#148; impairment
charges. The &#147;other than temporary&#148; impairment charges recorded in 2006 and 2005 relate to
investments that the Company may not have the ability to hold to maturity or recovery as a result
of the ratings downgrades of PXRE in February&nbsp;2006. In 2004 we recognized $0.1&nbsp;million of
impairment losses on investment securities whose value had fallen below 80% of face value for more
than six months.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the expected tax consequences of temporary
differences between carrying amounts and the tax bases of PXRE&#146;s United States subsidiaries assets
and liabilities. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, PXRE had a deferred tax asset net of deferred income tax
liability of $50.3&nbsp;million, offset by a valuation allowance of $50.3&nbsp;million. Management reviewed
the net deferred tax asset as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, and as a result of the ratings downgrades of
PXRE that occurred subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2005, and the related uncertainty with respect to the
amount of future taxable income that will be generated by the Company, have concluded that the full
valuation allowance established at December&nbsp;31, 2005 continues to be required for the entire
deferred tax asset as of December&nbsp;31, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE&#146;s management will evaluate this valuation allowance on an ongoing basis and will make any
necessary adjustments to it based upon any changes in management&#146;s expectations of future taxable
income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If PXRE were to implement the merger with Argonaut resulting in a change of control,
utilization of the net operating loss carry-forward included in deferred tax assets would be
limited in future periods.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, net income before convertible preferred share dividends
was $28.5&nbsp;million compared to net loss before convertible preferred share dividends of $697.6
million for 2005. Our net income in 2006 reflected the absence of any significant loss events
during 2006 as well as net favorable development on our reserves for prior years. This was offset
by a $303.8&nbsp;million, or 78%, decrease in net premiums earned during 2006 as compared to 2005 due to
the cancellation and non-renewal of many of our reinsurance contracts due to our ratings downgrades
in February&nbsp;2006. The primary cause of the net loss in 2005 was the net impact of catastrophe
losses arising from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma of $806.9
million, after reinsurance recoveries on our outwards reinsurance program and the impact of
inwards and outwards reinstatements and additional premiums.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net
income per diluted common share was $0.33 for 2006, compared to net loss per diluted
common share of $21.65 for 2005, based on diluted average shares
outstanding of approximately 72.0
million in 2006 and 32.5&nbsp;million in 2005. In accordance with
SFAS No.&nbsp;128, &#147;Earnings Per Share,&#148; for 2006 and 2005
it did not include 5.1 million and 11.0

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in both ceded premiums written and ceded premiums earned during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2006 as compared to the prior year was largely due to $107.8&nbsp;million of ceded
reinstatement and additional premiums related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma recognized
during 2005 compared to virtually none in 2006. The decrease was offset, in part, by an increase
of $57.7&nbsp;million and $57.0&nbsp;million in ceded premiums written and ceded premiums earned,
respectively, largely associated with excess of loss retrocessional catastrophe coverage during
2006, including one of the collateralized catastrophe facilities entered into during the fourth
quarter of 2005 to protect the Company against a severe catastrophe event.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in both net premiums written and net premiums earned during 2006 was a result of
the decrease in gross premiums written and gross premiums earned of $403.5&nbsp;million and $354.6
million, respectively, which were primarily a result of the cancellation and non-renewal of the
majority of our reinsurance contracts as well as reinstatement premiums written and earned from
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005, offset, in part, by the decrease in ceded premiums
written and ceded premiums earned of $50.1&nbsp;million and $50.8&nbsp;million, respectively that were
incurred in 2005 primarily in connection with Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underwriting results of a property and casualty insurer are discussed frequently by
reference to its loss ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio. The loss ratio is the result of
dividing losses and loss expenses incurred by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is the result
of dividing underwriting expenses (including amortization of expenses previously deferred,
commission and brokerage, net of fee income, and operating expenses) by net premiums earned. The
combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio less than 100%
indicates underwriting profits and a combined ratio greater than 100% indicates underwriting
losses. The combined ratio does not reflect the effect of net investment income, other reinsurance
related expense or other fee income on underwriting results. The ratios discussed below have been
calculated on a GAAP basis.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Losses and loss expenses incurred amounted to $12.4&nbsp;million in 2006 compared to $1,011.5
million in 2005. The loss ratio was 14.7% for 2006 compared to 260.5% for 2005. The decrease in
our loss ratio was due to the absence of any significant property catastrophe losses during 2006
compared to net losses and loss expenses incurred of $850.8&nbsp;million from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita
and Wilma which occurred in 2005. In addition, there was net favorable development of $10.4
million on prior year losses during 2006 compared to $23.9&nbsp;million of adverse development for prior
year losses in 2005.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net favorable development of $10.4&nbsp;million for prior-year losses and loss expenses was
comprised of $16.3&nbsp;million of favorable development in the catastrophe and risk excess segment
and $5.9&nbsp;million of adverse development in the exited lines segment. The $16.3&nbsp;million of
prior-year favorable development in the catastrophe and risk excess segment was primarily related
to favorable reported loss activity on our prior-year non-significant catastrophe losses. During
2006, there was approximately $0.5&nbsp;million of adverse development to our estimate of net losses and
loss expenses for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Prior year losses in the exited lines
segment increased because of higher than expected reported claims.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was $22.8&nbsp;million of net incurred losses from current-year losses and loss expenses
during 2006 associated with non-significant catastrophe loss activity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2005, we experienced net adverse development of $23.9&nbsp;million for prior-year losses and
loss expenses, comprised of $17.3&nbsp;million of adverse development on our catastrophe and risk excess
segment and $6.6&nbsp;million of adverse development on our exited lines segment. The $17.3&nbsp;million of
prior-year catastrophe and risk excess losses was primarily related to re-estimation of the 2004
storm losses following additional claim reports from cedents. Prior year losses in the exited
lines segment increased because of higher than expected reported claims.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Underwriting Expenses</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expense ratio was 73.7% for 2006 compared with 21.9% for 2005. The commission and
brokerage ratio, net of fee income, was 22.4% for 2006 compared with 12.6% for 2005. The increase
in the commission and brokerage ratio, net of fee income, is primarily attributable to the increase
in ceded premium amounts which decreased net premiums earned without decreasing brokerage expenses,
thus causing our commission and brokerage ratio to increase.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operating expense ratio was 51.3% for 2006 compared with 9.3% for 2005. The increase in
the operating expense ratio can be attributed to the decrease in net premiums earned and an
increase in operating costs in 2006. Other operating expenses increased $7.2&nbsp;million, or 20%, to
$43.4&nbsp;million for 2006 from $36.2&nbsp;million in 2005 largely as a result of an increase in fees to
attorneys and financial advisors, which have been incurred as a result of our ratings downgrades,
the Board of Directors&#146; decision to explore strategic alternatives for the Company and class action
securities lawsuits filed against the Company during the second quarter of 2006.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of 2005, PXRE sponsored a catastrophe bond transaction which was
determined to be a derivative and recorded at fair value. During 2006 the increase of $16.9
million in other reinsurance related expense was due to the change in fair value of this
derivative, principally due to the passage of one year of the transaction&#146;s risk coverage for
calendar year 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Net Investment Income</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net investment income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 increased $15.4&nbsp;million, or 34%, to
$60.7&nbsp;million from $45.3&nbsp;million for 2005. This increase was primarily due to a $20.2&nbsp;million
increase in income from our fixed maturity and short-term investment
portfolios, offset, in part,
by a $6.6&nbsp;million decrease in income from our hedge funds. The average invested balances in our
fixed maturity and short-term investment portfolio increased due to cash flows
from proceeds from a public offering and private placement of $474.0&nbsp;million in the fourth
quarter of 2005 as discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as well as from the
proceeds from the redemptions of hedge fund investments during 2006. The net return of the fixed
maturity and short-term investment portfolios, excluding realized and unrealized capital gains,
increased to 4.9% for 2006, on an annualized basis, compared to 3.7% for 2005 due to improved
yields throughout the portfolio, but particularly within our short-term portfolio. Investment
income related to our hedge fund portfolio decreased to $5.2&nbsp;million in 2006 from $11.9&nbsp;million in
2005. Investments in hedge funds produced a return of 9.1% for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006
compared with 8.5% for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005. Subsequent to, and as a result of the
ratings downgrades in February&nbsp;2006, redemption orders were executed for all of the Company&#146;s hedge
fund investments and as a result income from hedge funds is expected to continue to decrease in
future periods as we receive the proceeds from our various hedge funds.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 was affected by various other
reinsurance contracts where premiums payable under such contracts were retained on a funds withheld
basis. In order to reduce credit risk or to comply with regulatory credit for reinsurance
requirements, a portion of premiums paid under such reinsurance contracts is retained by the cedent
pending payment of losses or commutation of the contract. Investment income on such withheld funds
is typically for the benefit of the reinsurer and the cedent may provide a minimum investment
return on such funds. On September&nbsp;30, 2006, one remaining ceded reinsurance contract was commuted
and the underlying funds withheld balances were settled with the reinsurers that were parties to
this contract. Prior to this commutation and as of December&nbsp;31, 2005, we held premiums and accrued
investment income of $86.4&nbsp;million due to reinsurers. On this ceded reinsurance contract we
recognized a reduction to gross investment income of $4.7&nbsp;million and $6.7&nbsp;million during the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. On a net basis, this reduction to investment
income was $1.4&nbsp;million and $3.0&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, representing the difference between the stated investment return under such contracts
and the overall yield achieved on our total investment portfolio for the period. The weighted
average contractual investment return on the funds held by PXRE is 7.1% and 7.7% for the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As a result of the commutation, in future periods
the Company will not experience a reduction to gross or net investment income with respect to this
contract.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net realized investment losses for 2006 were $7.8&nbsp;million. The losses were primarily the
result of the write down of $7.3&nbsp;million of investment securities due to other than temporary
impairment following the downgrades of PXRE&#146;s credit ratings in February&nbsp;2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net realized investment losses for 2005 were $14.7&nbsp;million. The losses were primarily the
result of the write down of $11.8&nbsp;million of investment securities due to other than temporary
impairment following the downgrades of PXRE&#146;s credit ratings in February&nbsp;2006 and the sale of PXRE
Limited, the sole member of PXRE Lloyd&#146;s Syndicate 1224, during the fourth quarter of 2005.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE recognized a tax expense of $0.6&nbsp;million in 2006 compared to a tax expense of $5.9

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management has reviewed PXRE&#146;s deferred tax asset and due to uncertainty with respect to the

rating in February&nbsp;2006, has concluded that a full valuation allowance of $50.3&nbsp;million is required
for all of its deferred tax asset, $48.5&nbsp;million of which relates to tax benefits that otherwise
would have been, with respect to 2005, or have been, with respect to years prior to 2005,
recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2005 and prior periods. The remainder
relates to the tax consequences of temporary differences in Other Comprehensive Operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, net loss before convertible preferred share dividends
was $697.6&nbsp;million compared to net income before convertible preferred share dividends of $22.8
million for 2004. The primary cause of this net loss was the net impact of catastrophe losses
arising from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma of $806.9&nbsp;million, after reinsurance recoveries on
our outwards reinsurance program and the impact of inwards and outwards reinstatements and
additional premiums. Our net income in 2004 was materially impacted by losses arising from the
occurrence of Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net loss per diluted common share was $21.65 for 2005 compared to net income per diluted
common share of $0.59 for 2004, based on diluted average shares outstanding of approximately 32.5
million in 2005 and 15.0&nbsp;million in 2004. In accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;128, &#147;Earnings Per
Share,&#148; for 2005 and 2004 the Company did not include 11.0

December&nbsp;31, 2005 was primarily driven by reinstatement premiums of $159.5&nbsp;million in 2005,
including $151.7&nbsp;million of reinstatement premiums from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma,
compared to $35.1&nbsp;million of reinstatement premiums in 2004 which were primarily a result of the
2004 Florida hurricanes and Asian typhoons. Before the effects of reinstatement premiums, PXRE
experienced growth in gross premiums written and gross premiums earned of 23% and 16%,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the Company&#146;s reinsurance recoverable related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and
Wilma are either fully collateralized or reside with entities presently rated &#147;A&#148; or higher.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2005 current year net losses incurred of $987.6&nbsp;million is mainly due to the 2005
hurricanes which amounted to $638.0&nbsp;million from Hurricane Katrina, $68.9&nbsp;million from Hurricane
Rita and $143.9&nbsp;million from Hurricane Wilma.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2005, we experienced net adverse development of $23.9&nbsp;million for prior-year losses and
loss expenses, consisting of $17.3&nbsp;million of adverse development on our catastrophe and risk
excess segment and $6.6&nbsp;million of adverse development on our exited lines segment. The $17.3
million of prior-year catastrophe and risk excess losses was primarily related to re-estimation of
the 2004 storm losses following additional claim reports from cedents. Prior year losses in the
exited lines segment increased because of higher than expected reported claims.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2004, we experienced net adverse development of $12.0&nbsp;million for prior-year losses and
loss expenses, comprised of $11.4&nbsp;million catastrophe and risk excess net favorable development and
$23.4&nbsp;million exited lines net adverse development. The favorable development in the catastrophe
and risk excess business was primarily related to case reserve takedowns from past significant
catastrophes, such as the 2002 European floods. The $23.4&nbsp;million net adverse development related
to exited lines was due primarily to $13.7&nbsp;million of adverse loss development on the LMC XOL
Contract. During the fourth quarter of 2004, this contract was commuted. We also experienced
$19.7&nbsp;million of adverse development on our exited direct casualty reinsurance operations. The
primary cause of the adverse development was higher than expected reported losses in 2004.
Favorable development in other exited lines partially offset the adverse development experienced on
the LMC XOL Contract and our exited direct reinsurance operations. During the third and fourth
quarters of 2004, we completed commutations of two of the largest exited direct general liability
reinsurance programs, the first resulting in a $2.0&nbsp;million reduction in incurred losses and the
second in a $1.0&nbsp;million increase in incurred losses.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expense ratio was 21.9% for 2005 compared with 24.5% for 2004. The commission and
brokerage ratio, net of fee income, was 12.6% for 2005 compared with 11.1% for 2004. The increase
in the commission and brokerage ratio is primarily attributable to the increase in ceded
reinstatement and additional premium amounts incurred in connection with the Company&#146;s ceded
reinsurance program as a result of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. While these ceded
reinstatement and additional premium amounts decreased earned premium, they did not decrease
brokerage expenses on assumed reinsurance business, thus causing our commission and brokerage ratio
to increase. In addition, commission and brokerage includes costs associated with reinsurance
protection through a collateralized catastrophe bond transaction of $3.6&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operating expense ratio was 9.3% for 2005 compared with 13.4% for 2004. The decrease is
the result of increased net premiums earned and decreased operating costs in 2005. Operating
expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005 decreased $5.1&nbsp;million, or 12%, to $36.2&nbsp;million from
$41.3&nbsp;million in 2004 as a result of a 10% reduction in personnel and the curtailment of the
Company&#146;s retirement plans during 2004 and decreases in various operating expenses such as costs
associated with Sarbanes-Oxley Section&nbsp;404 compliance and consulting costs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net investment income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005 increased $19.1&nbsp;million, or 73%, to
$45.3&nbsp;million from $26.2&nbsp;million for 2004. This increase was primarily due to a $13.8&nbsp;million
increase in income from our fixed maturity and short-term investment portfolios resulting from the
increase in the average invested balance due to cash flows from financing activities, including the
$474.0&nbsp;million of net proceeds from the two equity offerings which were completed in the fourth
quarter of 2005 and net proceeds of $98.2&nbsp;million from a common share offering in the fourth
quarter of 2004. Additionally, the book yield of our fixed maturity and short-term investment
portfolios increased to 3.7% for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005 from 3.2% for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2004. Lastly, investment income related to our hedge fund portfolio increased to
$11.9&nbsp;million in 2005 from $8.7&nbsp;million in 2004 as investments in hedge funds produced a return of

other reinsurance contracts where premiums payable under such contracts were retained on a funds
withheld basis. In order to reduce credit risk or to comply with regulatory credit for reinsurance
requirements, a portion of premiums paid under such reinsurance contracts is retained by the cedent
pending payment of losses or commutation of the contract. Investment income on such withheld funds
is typically for the benefit of the reinsurer and the cedent may provide a minimum investment
return on such funds. We have both ceded and assumed reinsurance contracts that involve the
withholding of premiums by the cedent. On assumed reinsurance contracts, cedents held premiums and
accrued investment income for which we have recognized $0.9&nbsp;million of investment income for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004. On ceded reinsurance contracts, we held premiums and accrued
investment income of $86.4&nbsp;million due to reinsurers as of both December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004 for

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Capital Resources</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and PXRE Delaware rely primarily on dividend payments and capital distributions
from PXRE Bermuda and PXRE Reinsurance to pay its operating expenses, to meet its debt service
obligations and to pay dividends. In the wake of losses incurred as a result of Hurricanes
Katrina, Rita and Wilma which occurred in 2005, PXRE Reinsurance has
an accumulated deficit and, therefore, may not declare and pay any dividend without regulatory
approval. Based on the total statutory capital of PXRE Bermuda as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the
aggregate capital distribution that is available to be paid during 2007, without prior regulatory
approval is $104.6&nbsp;million. Since our ratings downgrades in February&nbsp;2006, we have been actively
communicating with the BMA and we do not intend to make any further dividends or capital
distributions without prior notification to the BMA. <I>See Item&nbsp;I &#150; Business: Regulation. </I>PXRE
Bermuda paid a capital distribution of $27.0&nbsp;million to the Company during 2006. PXRE Reinsurance
did not pay any dividends in 2006. We anticipate that this dividend and capital distribution
capacity (with notification to the BMA) will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs during 2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Liquidity</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary sources of liquidity for our principal operating subsidiaries have historically
been net cash flows from operating activities (including interest income from investments), the
maturity or sale of investments, borrowings, capital contributions and advances. Funds are applied
primarily to the payment of claims, operating expenses and to the purchase of investments.
Premiums are typically received in advance of related claim payments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following our February&nbsp;2006 ratings downgrades and the resulting level of contract
terminations from our assumed book of business, in conjunction with paid losses primarily from
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, resulted in net cash used by operating activities. Subsequent
to, and as a result of, the downgrades, we sold approximately $490.5&nbsp;million of fixed income
securities held by PXRE Bermuda, and additionally executed redemption orders for all of the
Company&#146;s hedge fund investments. The proceeds of the sales of the fixed income securities were
all received by the first week of March&nbsp;2006 and were reinvested in commercial paper and other
short term investments. With respect to the proceeds of the sales of the hedge fund investments,
approximately 92% of such proceeds were received by December&nbsp;31, 2006. The remainder is expected
to be received by June&nbsp;30, 2007. As a result of these steps, we believe we have sufficient
liquidity to meet the currently foreseen needs of our counterparties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the merger with Argonaut is not consummated and our Board of Directors concludes that no
other feasible strategic alternative would be in the best interests of our shareholders, it may
determine that the best course of action is to place the reinsurance operations of PXRE into
runoff. If runoff is chosen, the only sources of liquidity for our principal operating
subsidiaries will be the maturity or sale of investments, as we will no longer expect to have net
positive cash flows from operating activities, borrowings, capital contributions or advances. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2006, we have $671.2&nbsp;million of short term investments and $532.9&nbsp;million of other
invested assets. Based upon our current estimates of losses and loss expenses and other
liabilities on our December&nbsp;31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet, we believe we have sufficient
liquidity to meet the currently foreseen needs of our counterparties should we elect to go into
runoff, however the nature and timing of cash flows could be highly uncertain in this scenario.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;7, 2005, PXRE completed the public offering of 8,843,500 of its common shares,
including 1,153,500 shares sold upon exercise of the
underwriter&#146;s over-allotment option in full, at a public offering price of $13.25 per share. Net proceeds to the Company from the
common share offering, after deducting estimated expenses and underwriter&#146;s discounts and
commissions, were approximately $114.7&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated as of September&nbsp;29, 2005, PXRE agreed to issue
and sell 375,000 Series&nbsp;D Preferred Shares in a private placement exempt from registration under
the Securities Act of 1933. The Series&nbsp;D Preferred Shares were mandatorily exchangeable for common
shares upon the shareholders&#146; approval of the exchange. The private placement closed on October&nbsp;7,
2005. The gross proceeds from the private placement were $375.0&nbsp;million, and proceeds net of
agents&#146; discounts and commissions and offering expenses were $359.3&nbsp;million. The Series&nbsp;D
Preferred Shares were mandatorily exchanged into 34,090,906 common shares following the affirmative
vote of the Company&#146;s shareholders at a special general meeting held on November&nbsp;18, 2005 approving
the exchange of the Series&nbsp;D Preferred Shares and the authorization of an additional 300.0&nbsp;million
common shares.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE contributed the $474.0&nbsp;million net proceeds of the public offering and the private
placement to PXRE Bermuda to support the underwriting of reinsurance business during subsequent
renewal periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;23, 2004, PXRE completed a public offering of 5.2&nbsp;million of its common shares at
$23.75 per share, consisting of 3.7&nbsp;million shares offered by the Company and 1.5&nbsp;million shares
offered by certain selling shareholders. On December&nbsp;2, 2004, the underwriters exercised in-full
the overallotment option to purchase 0.8&nbsp;million additional common shares, consisting of 0.7
million shares from the Company and 0.1&nbsp;million shares from the selling shareholders. After giving
effect to the sale of the overallotment shares, a total of 6.0&nbsp;million shares were sold in the
offering.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
shareholders. The selling shareholders converted 2,208 preferred shares, including accrued
dividends, to 1.6&nbsp;million common shares sold in the public offering, including the overallotment.
Net proceeds to the Company from the sale of common shares sold by the Company were approximately
$98.2&nbsp;million, including the overallotment. PXRE used its net proceeds for general corporate
purposes, including contributions to the capital of PXRE Bermuda to support growth in its business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;4, 2002, the Company raised $150.0&nbsp;million of additional capital through the issuance
of 15,000 Convertible Voting Preferred Shares (the &#147;Preferred Share Investment&#148;). As of December
31, 2006, 5,813 Preferred Shares were issued and outstanding. The Preferred Shares are entitled to
receive, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors and to the extent of funds legally
available for the payment of dividends, cumulative dividends per share at the rate per annum of 8%
of the sum of the stated value on each share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, payable
on a quarterly basis. Commencing in the second quarter of 2005, the dividends paid on such
convertible voting preferred shares are paid in cash, rather than in additional convertible voting
preferred shares. No dividends were paid in the first quarter of 2006 and therefore overdue
dividends were accrued at 10% per annum from April&nbsp;1, 2006 until paid on May&nbsp;30, 2006. Dividends
to preferred shareholders, paid in cash, during 2006 and 2005 amounted to $4.9&nbsp;million and $3.7&nbsp;million, respectively, and paid in kind during 2005 amounted
to $3.4&nbsp;million.

Deferrable Interest Debentures due February&nbsp;1, 2027 (the &#147;Subordinated Debt Securities&#148;). At
December&nbsp;31, 2006, obligations to PXRE Capital Trust amount to $102.7&nbsp;million. On April&nbsp;23, 1997,
PXRE Delaware and PXRE Capital Trust completed the registration with the SEC of an exchange offer
for these securities and the securities were exchanged for substantially similar securities (the
&#147;Capital Securities&#148;). Distributions on the Capital Securities (and interest on the related
Subordinated Debt Securities) are payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1 of
each year, commencing August&nbsp;1, 1997. On or after February&nbsp;1, 2007, PXRE Delaware has the right to

provided by operations of $27.3&nbsp;million in 2005 primarily due to an increase in net paid losses,
mainly attributable to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, and the decrease in premiums collected

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net cash provided by investing activities were $436.5&nbsp;million in 2006 compared to net cash
flows used by investing activities of $490.5&nbsp;million in 2005. This increase was primarily due to
the sale of investment securities in order to meet the Company&#146;s currently foreseen liquidity
needs. As discussed above, in February&nbsp;2006 we sold approximately $490.5&nbsp;million of fixed income
securities held by PXRE Bermuda, and additionally executed redemption orders for all of the
Company&#146;s hedge fund investments. Because of the nature of the coverages we provided, which
typically can produce infrequent losses of high severity, it is not possible to accurately predict
our future cash flows from operating activities. As a consequence, cash flows from operating
activities may fluctuate, perhaps significantly, between individual quarters and years.

companies if such LOC is required under the terms of the contract. All of the facilities require
the Company to provide collateral in the form of fixed maturity securities or cash to the issuing
bank as security for outstanding LOCs. The first is a $110.0&nbsp;million committed facility with
Barclays Bank plc under which the Company pays the issuing bank an annual standby commitment fee of
0.15% per annum. The second is a $200.0&nbsp;million committed facility with Citibank Ireland Financial
Services plc under which the Company pays the issuing bank an annual standby commitment fee of
0.10% per annum. The third is an uncommitted facility with Merrill Lynch that allows for LOCs to
be issued subject to satisfactory collateral being provided to the issuing bank by the Company.
There is no commitment fee for the third facility. The Company must transfer eligible assets to
collateral accounts prior to each respective bank issuing an LOC. Since eligible assets include
fixed income investments, such securities need not be sold in order to qualify as eligible
collateral. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company has pledged assets with a fair value of $329.5

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loss and loss expense reserves represent management&#146;s best estimate of the ultimate cost
of settling the underlying reinsurance claims. As more fully discussed in <I>&#147;Critical Accounting
Policy Disclosures &#150; Estimation of Losses and Loss Expenses&#148; </I>above, the estimation of loss and loss
expense reserves is based on various complex and subjective judgments. Actual losses and loss
expenses paid may deviate, perhaps substantially, from the reserve estimates reflected in our
consolidated financial statements. Similarly, the timing for payment of our estimated losses is not
fixed and is not determinable on an individual or aggregate basis. The assumptions used in
estimating the likely payments due by periods are based on the Company&#146;s historical claims payment
experience, but due to the inherent uncertainty in the process of estimating the timing of such
payments, there is a risk that the amounts paid in any such period can be significantly different
than the amounts disclosed above.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to better protect PXRE against the risk of the occurrence of multiple significant
catastrophe events, we sponsored a catastrophe bond transaction that
closed during the fourth quarter of 2005. The transaction was a $250.0&nbsp;million collateralized transaction with A&#038;W II,
a Cayman Island reinsurance company, which is accounted for as a derivative. It is designed to
provide coverage to PXRE for second event losses in the same calendar year arising from hurricanes
in the Eastern and Gulf coasts of the United States, windstorms in northern Europe and earthquakes
in California. The agreement with A&#038;W II provides two tranches of protection to PXRE for the risk
that a second significant catastrophe loss arising from a hurricane in the Eastern and Gulf coasts
of the United States, a windstorm in northern Europe or earthquake in California occurs following
the occurrence of a first significant hurricane, windstorm or earthquake loss. The coverage
provided $250.0&nbsp;million of protection for the period from January&nbsp;1, 2006 to December&nbsp;31, 2006 and
provides $125.0&nbsp;million for the period from January&nbsp;1, 2007 to December&nbsp;31, 2008. The annual
premium payments with respect to the A&#038;W II facility are $8.0&nbsp;million in 2007 and 2008,
respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The A&#038;W II coverage is based on a modeled loss trigger. PXRE created a series of notional
portfolios of reinsurance contracts designed to closely mimic the expected exposures in PXRE&#146;s
assumed reinsurance portfolio. Upon the occurrence of a hurricane, windstorm or earthquake in the
covered territories, the parameters of the catastrophe event are determined and modeled against the
notional portfolios. If the modeled loss to the notional portfolio exceeds the attachment point
for the peril at issue, then the coverage is activated. Upon the occurrence of a second
catastrophe event in the covered territories during that calendar year, the parameters of the
catastrophe event are determined and modeled against the notional portfolios. If the modeled loss
to the notional portfolio for the second event exceeds the attachment point for the peril at issue,
then PXRE will make a recovery under the agreement. The recovery is based on modeled losses and,
unlike A&#038;W I, is not limited to PXRE&#146;s ultimate net loss from the loss event.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;21, 2005, A&#038;W II financed the coverage through the issuance of $250.0&nbsp;million in
catastrophe bonds pursuant to Rule&nbsp;144A under the Securities Act of 1933.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reinsurance companies that are counterparties to these transactions are variable interest
entities under the provisions of FIN 46R. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these
entities and is therefore not required to consolidate these entities in its consolidated financial
statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Board of Directors elects to pursue a strategic alternative that materially changes
PXRE&#146;s catastrophe risk profile, we may seek to assign or novate PXRE&#146;s rights and obligations
under the collateralized catastrophe facility to another insurance or reinsurance company. There
can be no assurance that any other insurance or reinsurance company would be willing to accept such
an assignment or novation, that the note holders who funded the facility would consent to such an
assignment or novation, or that the cost of such an assignment or novation would not have a
material adverse impact on PXRE. If PXRE was not able to successfully assign or novate its rights
and obligations under the collateralized catastrophe facility, PXRE could incur material
termination fees and liabilities. If the A&#038;W II facility is terminated prior to the end of the
scheduled termination date of a tranche, PXRE could be obligated to pay significant early
termination fees that could be as much as $5.8&nbsp;million, and PXRE is obligated to make all premium
payments up to the date of termination.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Board of Directors elects to pursue a strategic alternative that materially changes
PXRE&#146;s catastrophe risk profile, the Company will also need to evaluate its obligations under two
multi-year ceded reinsurance contracts that provide the Company with reinsurance protection against
catastrophic events in 2007 and 2008. In this regard, the Company will need to evaluate whether it
is likely that catastrophe loss exposure assumed by PXRE in 2007 and 2008 has the potential to
result in losses that exceed the retention level under these ceded reinsurance protections. The
Company is currently obligated to cede reinsurance premiums of $15.0&nbsp;million per annum in each of
2007 and 2008 under these multi-year contracts.

equal to the federal income tax payment that would have been payable by the relevant U.S.
subsidiary for the year if it had filed a separate income tax return for that year. PXRE Delaware
is required to provide payment of the consolidated federal income tax liability for the entire

subsidiaries is less than (or greater than) the annual tax liability for that U.S. subsidiary on a

liability of that U.S. subsidiary).

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are significant risks and uncertainties associated with our proposed merger with
Argonaut. For example, the merger may not be consummated, or may not be consummated in the third
quarter of 2007 as currently anticipated, as a result of a number of factors, including, without
limitation, the inability to obtain governmental approvals of the merger on the proposed terms or
the failure of either company to obtain stockholder approval for the merger. If the combined
company is not able to combine successfully the businesses of Argonaut and PXRE, the anticipated
benefits from the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than
expected. For example, it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, each of the major rating agencies placed the credit
ratings of our reinsurance subsidiaries on CreditWatch negative or the equivalent, and S&#038;P and A.M.
Best initially downgraded their ratings from &#147;A&#148; to &#147;A-.&#148; On February&nbsp;16, 2006, A.M. Best
downgraded its financial strength rating from &#147;A-&#148; to &#147;B&#043;&#043;&#148; with a negative outlook. In February,
2006, A.M. Best further downgraded its financial strength rating from &#147;B&#043;&#043;&#148; to &#147;B&#043;&#148; with negative
implications and S&#038;P downgraded its counterparty credit and financial strength rating on PXRE
Reinsurance and PXRE Bermuda from &#147;A-&#148; to &#147;BBB&#043;&#148; and placed these ratings on CreditWatch with
negative implications. Thereafter, S&#038;P further downgraded its counterparty credit and financial
strength rating on PXRE Reinsurance and PXRE Bermuda from &#147;BBB&#043;&#148; to &#147;BBB-&#148;. Moody&#146;s downgraded its
insurance financial strength rating of PXRE Reinsurance from &#147;Baa1&#148; to &#147;Baa2&#148; and placed this
rating under review for possible further downgrade. Subsequently, Moody&#146;s further downgraded its
insurance financial strength rating of PXRE Reinsurance from &#147;Baa2&#148; to &#147;Baa3&#148; and placed this
rating under review for possible further downgrade.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April, 2006, after finding that operational ratings below the critical &#147;A&#148; category
provided little value for a reinsurer we announced that we had requested that the major credit
rating agencies withdraw their financial strength and claims paying ratings of the Company and its
operating subsidiaries. In the wake of this request, A.M. Best downgraded its financial strength
ratings of PXRE Reinsurance and PXRE Bermuda from &#147;B&#043;&#148; to &#147;B&#148; and withdrew these ratings; S&#038;P
downgraded its counterparty credit and financial strength rating on PXRE Reinsurance and PXRE
Bermuda from &#147;BBB-&#148; to &#147;BB&#043;&#148; and then withdrew these ratings; and Moody&#146;s downgraded its insurance
financial strength rating of PXRE Reinsurance from &#147;Baa3&#148; to &#147;Ba2&#148; and then withdrew this rating.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position
of reinsurance companies. Due to the ratings downgrades and withdrawal of the operational ratings
of our reinsurance subsidiaries by A.M. Best, S&#038;P and Moody&#146;s, our competitive position in the
reinsurance industry has suffered and we have been unable to retain or renew our reinsurance
portfolio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the merger is not consummated, unless we are able to implement a strategic alternative that
would allow us to provide clients with an acceptably rated counterparty, we do not anticipate being
able to underwrite any material amount of new reinsurance business in 2007 and would therefore not
be able to generate any material amount of net premiums earned during 2007. The reduction in
premium income has and will have a material adverse effect on our future operating results,
liquidity and financial condition. Net premiums earned were our primary source of revenue for the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, accounting for 61% and 92% of our revenue, respectively.
In 2006 and 2005, revenue from non-premium sources was not sufficient to offset operating expenses
and interest expenses. We therefore expect to incur net operating losses in future periods unless
we are successful in executing a strategic alternative other than runoff. If such operating losses were to occur, this would result in a decline in our
shareholders&#146; equity.

of the rating downgrades, our Board of Directors decided to retain Lazard (who has since been

Even if we are successful in identifying and completing a merger or sale of PXRE or some other
strategic alternative, we cannot provide any assurance about the financial impact or timing of the

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In almost one year of considering potential strategic alternatives, the Argonaut merger was

arrangement with its policyholders in which it estimates and pays out all existing and contingent
liabilities with a view to liquidating PXRE in accordance with a procedure which is approved by a
statutory majority of policyholders. Under Bermuda law this is referred to as a solvent scheme of
arrangement and is, in effect, a global commutation of PXRE&#146;s business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, a program of individual commutations could be pursued with a similar result.
Following either a scheme or individual commutation program, PXRE would be placed into liquidation
as a solvent entity (a voluntary liquidation approved by shareholders). In the event that PXRE
were to become insolvent, the Company would have to be liquidated under the supervision of the
Bermuda Supreme Court during which a court appointed liquidator of PXRE may or may not pursue a
scheme of arrangement to shorten the time otherwise required to wind up PXRE&#146;s business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a winding up or liquidation as described above, a liquidator would be appointed and would
sell or otherwise dispose of our remaining assets, pay our existing liabilities, including
contingent obligations (which would have to be estimated in advance of payment) and distribute net
proceeds, if any, to our shareholders in one or more liquidating distributions. In liquidation, we
may not receive any material amounts for the sale or other disposition of our assets. Further, in
liquidation, we will have significant obligations, including the costs incurred by the independent
liquidator appointed and the work required to estimate liabilities and realize assets.
Additionally, if we do not generate sufficient revenue to support our continued operations, we will
be required to reduce our cash balance to support our continued operations and the amount of any
liquidation proceeds available for distribution to our shareholders would thereby be reduced.
Accordingly, the amount and timing of distributions, if any, to shareholders in a liquidation
cannot be determined because such would depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of
proceeds received from any asset sales or dispositions, the time and amount required to resolve
outstanding obligations and the amount of any reserves for future contingencies. If PXRE were to

agreements.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2005, PXRE entered into a collateralized catastrophe facility
that currently provides $125.0&nbsp;million of aggregate protection against losses arising from
hurricanes in the Eastern and Gulf coasts of the United States, windstorms in northern Europe and
earthquakes in California.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the merger is not consummated, and the Board of Directors elects to pursue a strategic
alternative that materially changes PXRE&#146;s catastrophe risk profile, the Board of Directors may
elect to explore the assignment or novation of PXRE&#146;s rights and obligations under the
collateralized catastrophe facility to another insurance or reinsurance company. There can be no
assurance that any other insurance or reinsurance company would be willing to accept such an
assignment or novation, that note holders who funded the facilities would consent to such an
assignment or novation, or that the cost of such an assignment or novation would not have a
material adverse impact on PXRE. If PXRE was not able to successfully assign or novate its rights
and obligations under this collateralized catastrophe facility, PXRE could incur material
termination fees and liabilities., which could be as much as $5.8&nbsp;million and PXRE is obligated to
make all premium payments up to the date of termination.

evaluate its obligations under two multi-year ceded reinsurance contracts that provide the Company
with reinsurance protection against catastrophic events in 2007 and 2008. In this regard, the
Company will need to evaluate whether it is likely that catastrophe loss exposure assumed by PXRE
in 2007 and 2008 has the potential to result in losses that exceed the retention level under these

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success is dependent upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the
businesses that we insure and reinsure. Claim reserves represent estimates involving underwriting,
actuarial and statistical projections, at a given point in time, of our expectations of the
ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred. We utilize actuarial models as
well as historical insurance industry loss development patterns to assist in the establishment of
appropriate claim reserves. As a property catastrophe reinsurer, incurred losses are inherently
more volatile than those of primary insurers and reinsurers of risks that have an established
historical pattern of losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reserving for catastrophe losses, our estimates are influenced by underwriting and loss
information provided by our clients, industry catastrophe models and our internal analyses of this
information. As an event matures, we rely more and more on our development patterns by type of
event as well as contract information to project ultimate losses for the event. This process can
cause our ultimate estimates to differ significantly from initial projections.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our estimate of the ultimate incurred gross loss and loss expenses arising from Hurricanes
Katrina, Rita and Wilma of $1,023.5&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2006 is based mainly on modeling, a
review of exposed reinsurance contracts, claims notices received from clients, discussions with
clients and loss information provided by clients to underwriters as part of the underwriting
submissions received in connection with the January&nbsp;2006 renewal process. Although we have begun
to receive loss notices with respect to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, we have paid less than
60% of our net incurred loss with respect to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma as of December&nbsp;31,
2006. In addition, our estimates are subject to a high level of uncertainty arising out of
extremely complex and unique causation and coverage issues, including the appropriate attribution
of losses to wind or flood damage as opposed to other perils such as fire, business interruption or
civil commotion. The underlying policies generally contain exclusions for flood damage; however,
water damage caused by wind may be covered. We expect that causation and coverage issues may not be resolved for a considerable period of
time and may be influenced by evolving legal and regulatory developments.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our actual losses from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma may exceed our best estimate as a
result of, among other things, the receipt of additional information from clients, the attribution
of losses to coverages that for the purpose of our estimates we assumed would not be exposed, and
inflation in repair costs due to the limited availability of labor and materials, in which case our
financial results could be further materially adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing our best estimate for Hurricane Katrina, we have also assumed flood damage
exclusions contained in our cedent&#146;s underlying insurance policies will be effective. We
understand that various lawsuits are pending seeking to invalidate such flood damage exclusions on
various grounds. If such lawsuits were to successfully invalidate the underlying flood damage
exclusions or if the court or a jury were to find that an insurer had not adequately established
that a loss was attributable to flood rather than wind, our liabilities for losses and loss
expenses relating to Hurricane Katrina could prove to be inadequate, with a consequent adverse
impact on our earnings and shareholders&#146; equity in future periods. Based on reports in the press,
we understand that State Farm, one of the nation&#146;s largest insurers, has been engaging in various
settlement discussions concerning claims involving the controversies over the flood exclusion. We
do not reinsure State Farm, but it is unclear at this time how any potential settlements by State
Farm would impact or influence our cedents.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our clients were to incur widespread additional losses as a result of settlements or
adverse litigation results involving the flood vs. wind controversy, it is possible that our
current best estimate for Hurricane Katrina will be exceeded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our casualty and finite business, given our limited experience we do not have established
historical loss development patterns that can be used to establish loss liabilities. For these
lines of business, we rely on loss development patterns that have been estimated from industry or
client data, which may not accurately represent the true development pattern for the business we
wrote. For property lines of business, reserves may differ from ultimate settlement values due to
the infrequency of some types of catastrophe losses, the incompleteness of information in the wake
of a major catastrophe and delay in receiving that information. We may also seek to enter into
commutations of reinsurance contracts of exited lines of business. Actual claims and claim
expenses paid, including commutations, may deviate, perhaps substantially, from the reserve
estimates reflected in our financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our claim reserves are determined to be inadequate, we will be required to increase claim
reserves at the time of such determination with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the
period in which the deficiency is rectified. It is possible that claims in respect of events that
have occurred could exceed our claim reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, in a particular period, or our financial condition in general. As a compounding
factor, although most insurance contracts have policy limits, the nature of property and casualty
insurance and reinsurance is that losses can exceed policy limits for a variety of reasons and
could significantly exceed the premiums received on the underlying policies, thereby further
adversely affecting our financial condition.

catastrophic events, levels of capacity, general economic conditions and underwriting results of
primary property insurers. The supply of reinsurance is related to prevailing prices, recent loss
experience and levels of surplus capacity. All of these factors fluctuate and may contribute to
price declines generally in the reinsurance industry. Premium rates or other terms and conditions
of trade may vary in the future. If any of these factors were to
cause the demand for reinsurance to fall or the supply to rise, our profitability could be adversely
affected if we resume underwriting.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new
business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover
losses. Our capital needs may also be impacted by the strategic alternative path that the Board of
Directors ultimately determines to pursue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that the funds generated by our ongoing operations and existing capitalization
are insufficient to fund future operating requirements, liquidity needs, growth expectations and
cover claim payments, we may need to raise additional funds through financings. Any equity or debt
financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us or may be dilutive to
our shareholders. In addition, substantial sales of our equity in the public market, or the
perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common
shares. If we cannot obtain adequate capital, our business, operating results and financial
condition could be adversely affected in a material manner.

in an adverse impact on our financial position or results.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our invested assets consist primarily of debt instruments with fixed maturities, short-term
investments and, to a lesser extent, hedge funds and interests in mezzanine bond and equity limited
partnerships. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, 98.7% of PXRE&#146;s investment portfolio consisted of fixed
maturities and short-term investments and 1.3% consisted of hedge funds and other investments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2006, $490.5&nbsp;million of fixed maturity investments were liquidated and the
proceeds were invested in cash equivalents. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, $671.2&nbsp;million of our
invested assets were in short term investments. This could have a material negative impact on our
future income from our investment portfolio.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our invested assets are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations as well as to risks
inherent in particular securities. Although we seek to preserve our capital, we have invested in a
portfolio of hedge funds and other privately held securities. These investments were designed to
provide diversification of risk; however, such investments entail substantial risks. There can be
no assurance that our investment objectives will be achieved, and results may vary substantially
over time. In addition, although we seek to employ investment strategies that are not correlated
with our reinsurance exposures, losses in our investment portfolio may occur at the same time as
underwriting losses and, therefore, exacerbate such losses&#146; adverse effect on us. While our
primary objective is capital preservation, all our portfolios have a degree of risk. See

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liquidity risk exists in the hedge fund portfolio because there are delays between giving
notice to redeem a hedge fund investment and receiving proceeds. In February&nbsp;2006, redemption
orders were placed with our hedge funds in the amount of $150.0&nbsp;million. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, the
Company had $12.8&nbsp;million in hedge funds subject to redemption notices. The redemption terms are
defined in the offering documents and generally require notice periods and time scales for
settlement. We remain at risk during the notice period, which typically specifies a month or
quarter end reference point at which to calculate redemption proceeds. The risk also exists that a
hedge fund may be unable to meet its redemption obligations. A hedge fund may be faced with
excessive redemption notices and illiquid underlying investments.

defaults, or suffers an adverse credit event, we are exposed to loss. Our
exposure to any individual hedge fund is limited to the carrying value of the investment, and
we invest in a diversified portfolio of hedge funds that utilize different strategies and markets
to reduce this risk. However, different hedge funds in the portfolio may be net long in the same
or correlated securities at the same time, which could have an adverse effect on the value of the
portfolio and thus our financial condition.

could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finite risk reinsurance contracts are highly customized and typically involve complicated
structural elements. GAAP governs whether or not a contract should be accounted for as
reinsurance. Contracts that do not meet these GAAP requirements may not be accounted for as
reinsurance and are required to be accounted for as deposits. As reported in the past few years,
certain finite insurance and reinsurance arrangements are coming under scrutiny by the New York
Attorney General&#146;s Office, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other governmental
authorities. According to the press, investigators have asserted that the contracts in question
were accounted for in an improper or fraudulent manner.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sold finite reinsurance prior to June&nbsp;30, 2004, and from time to time, have purchased
finite reinsurance to which we are a party. Although we have received no request for information
or documents in connection with the investigations with respect to any finite reinsurance we sold
or purchased from time to time, certain of our customers or reinsurers have been asked to provide
or have provided documents and information in the framework of these investigations with respect to
reinsurance contracts to which we are a party. Any claim challenging the appropriateness of the
accounting treatment of the finite contracts we underwrote or purchased could result in negative
publicity, costs and, in the event of any regulatory or judicial decision being entered against us,
ultimately fines and penalties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business
and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Our reliance on reinsurance brokers exposes us to their credit risk.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with industry practice, we frequently pay amounts owed on claims under our
policies to reinsurance brokers, and these brokers, in turn, pay these amounts over to the insurers
that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities with us (we refer to these insurers as ceding
insurers). In some jurisdictions, if a broker fails to make such a payment, we might remain liable
to the ceding insurer for the deficiency. Conversely, in certain jurisdictions, when the ceding
insurer pays premiums for these policies to
reinsurance brokers for payment over to us, these premiums are considered to have been paid
and the ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for those amounts, whether or not we have
actually received the premiums. We are aware of one instance in recent years, involving an
insignificant amount, in which a broker did not forward premiums to us. Consequently, in
connection with the settlement of reinsurance balances, we assume a degree of credit risk
associated with brokers around the world.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we complete the merger or implement another strategic alternative, we are likely to
continue to rely on such brokers and assume this risk.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to limit the effect of large and multiple losses upon our financial condition, we buy
reinsurance for our own account. This type of insurance is known as retrocessional reinsurance.
From time to time, market conditions have limited, and in some cases have prevented, reinsurers
from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance which they consider adequate for their business
needs. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of retrocessional
reinsurance. In addition, even if we are able to obtain such retrocessional reinsurance, we may
not be able to negotiate terms as favorable to us as in prior years. In difficult market
conditions, pricing for our retrocessional reinsurance products may improve, but conversely,
obtaining retrocessional reinsurance for our own account on favorable terms can become more
difficult.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A retrocessionaire&#146;s insolvency or its inability or unwillingness to make payments under the
terms of a retrocessional reinsurance treaty with us could have a material adverse effect on us.
Therefore, our retrocessions subject us to credit risks because the ceding of risk to
retrocessionaires does not relieve us of our liability to our clients. In the event that we cede
business to a retrocessionaire, we must still pay on claims of our cedent even if we are not paid
by the retrocessionaire.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our current estimate of losses related to Hurricane Katrina, we have exhausted our
retrocessional protection with respect to this event, meaning that we have
no retrocessional coverage available should our Hurricane Katrina losses prove to be greater
than currently estimated. We cannot be sure that retrocessional coverage will be available to us
on acceptable terms, or at all, in the future. Our business, results of operations and financial
condition could be materially adversely impacted by additional losses related to Hurricane Katrina.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2005, PXRE entered into a collateralized facility that provides
$125.0&nbsp;million of aggregate protection against losses arising from hurricanes in the Eastern and
Gulf coasts of the United States, windstorms in northern Europe and earthquakes in California. The
coverage under the facility is based on a modeled loss trigger. PXRE created a series of notional
portfolios of reinsurance contracts designed to closely mimic the expected exposures in PXRE&#146;s
assumed reinsurance portfolio. Upon the occurrence of a hurricane, windstorm or earthquake in the
covered territories, the parameters of the catastrophe event are determined and modeled against the
notional portfolios. If the modeled loss to the notional portfolio exceeds the attachment point
for the peril at issue, then PXRE will make a recovery under the agreement. If such a hurricane,
windstorm or earthquake were to occur, there is a risk that the actual losses incurred by PXRE

Because many jurisdictions do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance
obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements unless
appropriate security mechanisms are in place, we anticipate that our reinsurance clients will
typically require PXRE Bermuda to post a letter of credit or other collateral. If we are unable to

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, insurers and reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating
results due to competition, frequency and severity of catastrophic events, levels
of capacity, general economic conditions and other factors. The supply of insurance and
reinsurance is related to prevailing prices, the level of insured losses and the level of industry
surplus which, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments
being earned in the insurance and reinsurance industry. As a result, the insurance and reinsurance
business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price
competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity
permitted favorable premium levels. Our recent growth from January&nbsp;1, 2002 through December&nbsp;31,
2005 relates in part to improved industry pricing, but the supply of insurance and reinsurance may
increase, either by capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by
existing insurers or reinsurers, which may cause prices to decrease. Any of these factors could
lead to an adverse effect on our profits if we resume underwriting. In addition to these
considerations, changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers
may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance business significantly, and we expect to
experience the effects of such cyclicality.

In addition to the above, PXRE Bermuda has agreed to submit to
additional regulatory oversight by the BMA effective March 12, 2007.
Please refer to the section entitled &#147;Business: Regulation
&#151; Bermuda &#148; for a full discussion of this matter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These statutes and regulations may, in effect, restrict our ability to write reinsurance
policies, to distribute funds and to pursue our investment strategy.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not presently intend that PXRE Bermuda will be admitted to do business in any
jurisdiction in the United States, the United Kingdom or elsewhere (other than Bermuda). However,
we cannot assure you that insurance regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom or
elsewhere will not review the activities of PXRE Bermuda, or related companies or its agents and
claim that PXRE Bermuda is subject to such jurisdiction&#146;s licensing requirements. If any such
claim is successful and PXRE Bermuda must obtain a license, we may be subject to taxation in such
jurisdiction. (In certain circumstances, PXRE may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction even if it
is not licensed by such jurisdiction. See &#147;Risks Related to Taxation.&#148;) In addition PXRE Bermuda
is subject to indirect regulatory requirements imposed by jurisdictions that may limit its ability
to provide insurance or reinsurance. For example, PXRE Bermuda&#146;s ability to write insurance or
reinsurance may be subject, in certain cases, to arrangements satisfactory to applicable regulatory
bodies. Proposed legislation and regulations may have the effect of imposing additional
requirements upon, or restricting the market for, alien insurers or reinsurers with whom domestic
companies place business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, Bermuda insurance statutes and regulations applicable to PXRE Bermuda are less
restrictive than those that would be applicable if it were governed by the laws of any state in the
United States. In the past, there have been congressional and other initiatives in the United
States regarding proposals to supervise and regulate insurers domiciled outside the United States.
If in the future PXRE Bermuda becomes subject to any insurance laws of the United States or any
state thereof or of any other jurisdiction, we cannot assure you that PXRE Bermuda would be in
compliance with those laws or that coming into compliance with those laws would not have a
significant and negative effect on PXRE Bermuda&#146;s business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of obtaining licenses is very time consuming and costly, and we may not be able to
become licensed in a jurisdiction other than Bermuda, should we choose to do so. The modification
of the conduct of our business resulting from our becoming licensed in certain jurisdictions could
significantly and negatively affect our business. In addition our inability to comply with
insurance statutes and regulations could significantly and adversely affect our business by
limiting our ability to conduct business as well as subjecting us to penalties and fines.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we are incorporated in Bermuda, we are subject to changes of Bermuda law and
regulation that may have an adverse impact on our operations, including imposition of tax liability
or increased regulatory supervision. In addition, we will be exposed to changes in the political
environment in Bermuda. The Bermuda insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework recently has
become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions, including in the United States and in
various states within the
United States. We cannot predict the future impact on our operations of changes in the laws
and regulations to which we are or may become subject.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians (other than spouses of Bermudians or holders of permanent
residence certificates) may not engage in any gainful occupation in Bermuda without the specific
permission of the appropriate government authority. The Bermuda
government will issue a work
permit for a specific period of time, which may be extended upon showing that, after proper public
advertisements, no Bermudian (or spouse of a Bermudian or holder of a permanent residence
certificate) is available who meets the minimum standards for the advertised position. The Bermuda
government has a policy that limits the duration of work permits to six years, subject to certain
exemptions for key employees. A significant number of our key officers, including our Chief
Executive Officer, an executive vice president and key reinsurance underwriters are working in
Bermuda under work permits that will expire over the next two years. The Bermuda government could
refuse to extend these work permits. If any of our senior executive officers were not permitted to

such regulatory action could impact our ability to write insurance business in some jurisdictions.
In addition, the approval of insurance regulators would be required for the merger and its
implementation or for the implementation of any other strategic alternatives, that we may pursue,
particularly any one involving a change of control of such subsidiaries. A significant delay or
the denial of any required regulatory approval could negatively impact our ability to put into
effect a strategic alternative that we consider beneficial to our business, which could have a
material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, this
could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a holding company with no operations or significant assets other than the capital stock

The purpose of the reorganization was to consolidate all of our non-Bermudian subsidiaries under a
newly formed holding company established in Ireland, PXRE Ireland. PXRE Ireland is a wholly owned
subsidiary of PXRE Bermuda. In the reorganization, PXRE Reinsurance (Barbados) Ltd. distributed
all of the common shares of PXRE Delaware to PXRE Bermuda. PXRE Bermuda then contributed the
common shares of PXRE Delaware and the common shares of PXRE Europe to PXRE Ireland.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely primarily on cash dividends from PXRE Reinsurance, PXRE Ireland and PXRE Bermuda to
pay our operating expenses, including debt service payments, shareholder dividends, if any, income
taxes and other obligations that may arise from time to time. We expect future dividends and other
permitted payments from these subsidiaries to be our principal source of funds to pay expenses and
dividends. The payment of dividends by our reinsurance subsidiaries to us is limited under Bermuda
law, Irish law and under certain insurance statutes of various U.S. states in which they are
licensed to transact business. PXRE Reinsurance is subject to state regulatory restrictions that
limit the maximum amount of annual dividends or other distributions, including loans or cash
advances, available to stockholders without prior approval of the Insurance Commissioner of the
State of Connecticut. As of January&nbsp;1, 2007, PXRE Reinsurance cannot pay any dividends without the
prior approval of the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Connecticut.

shares owned by any such shareholder will be limited to a voting power of 9.9%, subject only to the
further limitation that no shareholder allocated any such voting rights may exceed the 9.9%
limitation as a result of such limitation. The board of directors may waive this limitation, and

a financial benefit that is greater than that received, or to be received, by other shareholders
with prior approval from our board of directors but without obtaining prior approval from our
shareholders. Amalgamations require the approval of the board of directors and, except in the case
of amalgamations with and between wholly-owned subsidiaries, a resolution of shareholders approved
by the affirmative vote of shareholders holding a majority of the
voting power of the then outstanding shares entitled to vote. If we were a Delaware corporation, we would need, subject to
certain exceptions, prior approval from shareholders holding at least two-thirds of our outstanding
common stock not owned by such interested shareholder to enter into a business combination (which,
for this purpose, includes mergers and asset sales of greater than 10% of our assets that would
otherwise be considered transactions in the ordinary course of business) with an interested
shareholder for a period of three years from the time the person became an interested shareholder,
unless we opted out of the relevant Delaware statute.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shareholders&#146; Suits.</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights of shareholders under Bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of
shareholders in many U.S. jurisdictions. Class actions and derivative actions are generally not
available to shareholders under the laws of Bermuda. However, the Bermuda courts ordinarily would
be expected to follow English case law precedent, which would permit a shareholder to commence an
action in our name to remedy a wrong done to us where an act is alleged to be beyond our corporate
power, is illegal or would result in the violation of our memorandum of association or bye-laws.
Furthermore, consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a
fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater
percentage of our shareholders than actually approved it. The winning party in such an action
generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys&#146; fees incurred in
connection with such action. Our bye-laws provide that shareholders waive all claims or
rights of action that they might have, individually or in our right, against any director or
officer for any act or failure to act in the performance of such director&#146;s or officer&#146;s duties,
except with respect to any fraud or dishonesty of such director or officer. Class actions and
derivative actions generally are available to shareholders under Delaware law for, among other
things, breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste and actions not taken in accordance with
applicable law. In such actions, the court has discretion to permit the winning party to recover
attorneys&#146; fees incurred in connection with such action.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Indemnification of Directors and Officers.</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Bermuda law and our bye-laws, we may indemnify our directors, officers or any other
person appointed to a committee of the board of directors (and their respective heirs, executors or
administrators) to the full extent permitted by law against all actions, costs, charges,
liabilities, loss, damage or expense incurred or sustained by such person by reason of any act
done, concurred in or omitted in the conduct of our business or in the discharge of his/her duties;
provided that such indemnification shall not extend to any matter in which any of such persons is
found, in a final judgment or decree not subject to appeal, to have committed fraud or dishonesty.
Under Delaware law, a corporation may indemnify a director or officer of the corporation against
expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred in defense of an action, suit or proceeding by reason of such position if (i)
such director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the corporation and (ii)&nbsp;with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, such director or officer had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.

common shareholders, and these investors could take actions or make decisions that are not in the
best interests of our common shareholders.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the anti-dilution protections afforded to the preferred shareholders could have a
material dilutive effect on our common shareholders. Each preferred share, in whole or in part, is
convertible at any time at the option of the holder into convertible common shares for that series
according to a formula set forth in the description of stock. The convertible common shares are,
in turn, convertible into common shares on a one-for-one basis. The number of convertible common
shares per preferred shares issuable upon any conversion will be determined by dividing a
liquidation preference for the series equal to the aggregate original purchase price of the
preferred shares plus accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, by the conversion price then in effect.
The conversion price is subject to adjustment to avoid dilution in the event of recapitalization,
reclassification, stock split, consolidation, merger, amalgamation or other similar event or
an issuance of additional common shares in a private placement below the fair market value or in a
registered public offering below 95% of fair market value or without consideration. In addition,
the conversion price is subject to adjustment for certain loss and loss expense development on
reserves for losses incurred on or before September&nbsp;30, 2001 and for any liability or loss arising
out of pending material litigation on December&nbsp;10, 2001. As of March&nbsp;12, 2007, the outstanding
convertible common shares and preferred shares were ultimately convertible into 5.2&nbsp;million common
shares, or 6.7% of our outstanding common shares on a fully converted basis. However, because the
conversion price for the preferred shares is subject to adjustment for a variety of reasons,
including if we have certain types of adverse loss development, the number of our common shares
into which the preferred shares are ultimately convertible and, accordingly, the amount of dilution
experienced by our common shareholders, could increase.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, upon conversion, sales of substantial amounts of common shares by these

of the common shares, as well as our ability to raise additional capital in the public equity
markets at a desirable time and price.

Republic of Ireland and the United States (the &#147;Irish Treaty&#148;) reduces the rate of withholding tax

federal income tax purposes such person&#146;s pro rata share of such non-U.S. insurance subsidiary&#146;s
RPII for the entire taxable year, determined as if such RPII were distributed proportionately only
to U.S. persons at that date regardless of whether such income is distributed. In addition, any
RPII that is includible in the income of a U.S. tax-exempt organization may be treated as unrelated
business taxable income. The amount of RPII earned by the non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries
(generally, premium and related investment income from the direct or indirect insurance or
reinsurance of any direct or indirect U.S. holder of common shares or any person related to such

insurance subsidiary did not in prior years of operation and is not expected in the foreseeable
future to equal or
exceed 20% of such subsidiary&#146;s gross insurance income. Additionally, we do not expect the
direct or indirect insureds of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries (and persons related to such
insureds) to directly or indirectly own 20% or more of either the voting power or value of our

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2006, 97.8% of the fair value of our fixed maturities and short-term
investments portfolio was in obligations rated &#147;A-&#148; or better by Moody&#146;s or S&#038;P. Mortgage and
asset-backed securities accounted for 25.1% of fixed maturities and short-term investments or 24.8%
of our total investment portfolio based on fair value at December&nbsp;31, 2006. The average yield to
maturity of our fixed maturities and short-term investments at December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005 was
approximately 5.3% and 4.7%, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had no direct investments in real estate or commercial mortgage loans as of December&nbsp;31,
2006, other than $6.8&nbsp;million of notes receivable and $1.0&nbsp;million of an equity investment in a
joint venture, Barr&#146;s Bay Properties Limited, which owns the premises in which the Company&#146;s
Bermuda headquarters reside. These amounts are included in Other Assets. We may, however, invest
in fixed maturities that are secured by commercial mortgages from time to time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed maturity investments, other than trading securities, are reported at fair value, with
the net unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive operations as a
separate component of shareholders&#146; equity. Fixed maturity investments classified as trading
securities are reported at fair value, with the net unrealized gain or loss reported as investment
income. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, an unrealized gain of $0.6&nbsp;million (gain of 1 cent per share, after
considering convertible preferred shares) was included in shareholders&#146; equity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short-term investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Our
short-term investments, principally corporate securities, treasury bills and agency securities,
amounted to $671.2&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2006, compared to $261.1&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2005
reflecting the re-deployment of securities following the downgrades in PXRE&#146;s ratings in February
2006, in order to have sufficient liquidity to meet the currently foreseen needs of PXRE&#146;s
counterparties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant component of our investment strategy has been investing a portion of our
invested assets in a diversified portfolio of hedge funds. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, total hedge fund
investments amounted to $12.8&nbsp;million, representing 1.1% of the total investment portfolio. At
December&nbsp;31, 2005, total hedge fund investments amounted to $148.2&nbsp;million, representing 9.0% of
the total investment portfolio. In 2006, our hedge funds earned a return of 9.1% as compared to
8.5% in 2005. As noted above, the Company executed redemption orders for all of its hedge funds
during the first quarter of 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hedge fund managers invest in a variety of markets utilizing a variety of strategies,

hedge fund managers may be compensated on terms that may include fixed and/or performance-based
fees or profit participations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through our hedge fund managers, we may invest or trade in any securities or instruments
including, but not limited to, U.S. and non-U.S. equities and equity-related instruments,
currencies, commodities and fixed-income and other debt-related instruments and derivative
instruments. Hedge fund managers may use both over-the-counter and exchange traded instruments
(including derivative instruments such as swaps, futures and forward agreements), trade on margin
and engage in short sales. Substantially all hedge fund managers are expected to employ leverage, to varying degrees, which magnifies both the potential for
gain and the exposure to loss, which may be substantial. Leverage may be obtained through margin
arrangements, as well as repurchase, reverse repurchase, securities lending and other techniques.
Trades may be on or off exchanges and may be in thinly traded securities or instruments, which
creates the risk that attempted purchases or sales may adversely affect the price of a particular
investment or its liquidation and may increase the difficulty of valuing particular positions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we seek capital appreciation with respect to our hedge fund investments, we are also
concerned with preservation of capital. Therefore, our hedge fund portfolio is designed to take
advantage of broad market opportunities and diversify risk. Nevertheless, our investment policies
with respect to our hedge fund investments generally do not restrict us from participating in
particular markets, strategies or investments.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mariner, as investment advisor, allocates assets to the hedge fund managers. Mariner monitors
hedge fund performance and periodically reallocates assets in its discretion. Mariner is familiar
with a number of hedge fund investment strategies utilized by our hedge fund managers. Mariner has
invested in some of these strategies and has a varying level of knowledge of others.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, our investment portfolio also included $2.4&nbsp;million of other invested

such investments are $0.2&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hedge funds and other limited partnership investments are accounted for under the equity

attributable to hedge funds and other investments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hedge fund and other privately held securities program should be viewed as exposing us to
the risk of substantial losses, which we historically sought to reduce through our multi-asset and

successful.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are exposed to certain market risks, including interest rate and credit risks. The
potential for losses exists from changes in interest rates with respect to our investments and
borrowings. We are exposed to potential losses from changes in probability of default with respect
to our investments. We believe our exposure to foreign exchange risk is not material with respect
to our fixed income portfolio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our risk management strategies is to bear market risks that do not correlate with
underwriting risks, and limit our exposure to market risks that may prevent us from servicing our
insurance obligations. Our Board of Directors approves investment guidelines and the selection of
external investment advisors who manage our portfolios. The investment managers make tactical
investment decisions within the established guidelines. Management monitors the external advisors
through written reports that are reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors or committee
thereof. Management also manages diversification strategies across the portfolios in order to
limit our potential loss from any single market risk. The performance
and risk profiles of the portfolio are reported in various forms throughout the fiscal year to
management, our Board of Directors, regulators, and to shareholders.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our investment portfolio is summarized in Item&nbsp;1, Business, Item&nbsp;15, Notes to the Financial

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Interest Rate Risk</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our principal fixed maturity market risk exposure is to changes in U.S. interest rates.
Changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio and
subordinated debt. Our holdings subject us to exposures in the treasury, municipal, and various
asset-backed sectors. These sectors consist primarily of investment grade securities whose fair
value is subject to interest rate, credit, prepayment and extension risk. All fixed maturity
investment positions are net long with no &#147;short&#148; or derivative positions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that reinsurance recoverables and payables do not expose us to significant interest
rate risk and are excluded from the analysis below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to measure our exposure to changes in interest rates a sensitivity analysis was
performed. Potential loss is measured as a change in fair value, net of applicable taxes. The
fair value of the fixed maturity and short-term investment portfolios and subordinated debt at
year-end were remeasured from the fair values reported in the financial statements assuming a 100
basis point increase in interest rates using various analytics and models. The potential loss in
fair value measured as a proportion of total shareholders&#146; equity, due to interest rate exposure
was estimated at 2.0% at December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 3.0% at December&nbsp;31, 2005. The potential loss
decreased due to a shift to shorter-duration investments and a reduction in the size of the overall
investment portfolio relative to total shareholders&#146; equity. Should such interest rate increase
occur, only the decline in fair value of our fixed maturity investments would be recorded in our
consolidated balance sheet; the decrease in the fair value of the subordinated debt would not be
recognized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated potential loss includes declines in the fair value related to prepayment risk
associated with the mortgage-related securities. The mortgage sector represents 21.9% of our
portfolio of fixed maturities and short-term investments at December&nbsp;31, 2006. The estimate
assumes a similar change in fair value across security sectors with no adjustment for change in
value due to credit risk.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Credit Risk</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, 98.7% of our investment portfolio, at fair value, consisted of fixed
maturities and short-term investments. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, 97.8% of the fair value of our fixed
maturities and short-term investment portfolio was in obligations rated &#147;A-&#148; or better by Moody&#146;s
or S&#038;P. With respect to diversification, at December&nbsp;31, 2006 we own 320 individual fixed maturity
investments. Non-agency mortgage and asset-backed securities accounted for 13.9% of our investment
portfolio based on fair value at December&nbsp;31, 2006. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, we had $3.1&nbsp;million at
fair value of privately held fixed maturities that are not traded on a recognized exchange.

PXRE&#146;s evaluation under the framework in <I>Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework</I>, PXRE&#146;s management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2006.
PXRE&#146;s management&#146;s assessment of the effectiveness of PXRE&#146;s internal control over financial

PXRE Group Ltd.:

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have audited management&#146;s assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting<I>, </I>that PXRE Group Ltd. (the
&#147;Company&#148;) maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). PXRE Group Ltd.&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management&#146;s assessment
and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management&#146;s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PXRE Group Ltd., and subsidiaries
(the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive operations, shareholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. In connection with our audits of the consolidated
financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedules listed in Item&nbsp;15 (a) (2)
of this Form 10-K. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules are
the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of PXRE Group Ltd. as of December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of PXRE Group Ltd.&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#151; Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
and our report dated March 16, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on management&#146;s assessment
of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE Group Ltd. (the &#147;Company&#148; or collectively with its subsidiaries, &#147;PXRE&#148;) is an insurance
holding company organized in Bermuda. PXRE provides reinsurance products and services to a
worldwide marketplace through its subsidiary operations located in Bermuda, Europe and the United
States. PXRE&#146;s primary focus is providing property catastrophe reinsurance and retrocessional
coverage. PXRE also provides marine, aviation and aerospace products and services. In February
2006, the Company&#146;s counterparty credit and financial strength ratings were downgraded by three
rating agencies, after which the Company withdrew such ratings. Subsequent to the Company&#146;s
ratings downgrades and through to December&nbsp;31, 2006, PXRE did not renew any of its reinsurance
contracts that expired, nor did PXRE write any new reinsurance contracts and therefore exposures
decreased compared to the prior year.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;). These statements reflect the consolidated
operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, including PXRE Reinsurance Ltd. (&#147;PXRE
Bermuda&#148;), PXRE Corporation (&#147;PXRE Delaware&#148;), PXRE Reinsurance Company (&#147;PXRE Reinsurance&#148;), PXRE
Solutions S.A. (&#147;PXRE Europe&#148;), PXRE Holding (Ireland) Limited (&#147;PXRE Ireland&#148;) and PXRE
Reinsurance (Barbados) Ltd. (&#147;PXRE Barbados&#148;). All intercompany transactions have been eliminated
in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (i)&nbsp;the reported amount
of assets and liabilities; (ii)&nbsp;the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements; and (iii)&nbsp;the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates which are
significant include estimation of losses and loss expenses, estimation and recognition of premiums,
valuation of investments and valuation of deferred tax assets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 1%"><U><B>Premiums Assumed and Ceded</B></U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Premiums on assumed and ceded reinsurance business are recorded as earned evenly over the
contract period based on estimated subject premiums. Adjustments based on actual subject premiums
are recorded in the period in which they are determined. The portion of assumed and ceded premiums
written relating to unexpired coverages at the end of the period is recorded as unearned premiums
and ceded unearned premiums, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assumed reinstatement premiums that reinstate coverage are written and earned at the time the
associated loss event occurs. The original premium is earned over the remaining exposure period of
the contract. Reinstatement premiums are estimated based upon contract terms for reported losses
and estimated for incurred but not reported losses (&#147;IBNR&#148;). Certain of our ceded reinsurance
contracts include additional premiums with provisions that adjust premiums based upon the loss
experience under the contracts. For these contracts, additional premiums are written and earned
following the loss event after considering the remaining coverage.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assumed reinsurance and retrocessional contracts that do not both transfer significant
insurance risk and result in the reasonable possibility that PXRE or its retrocessionaires may
realize a significant loss from the insurance risk assumed are accounted for as deposits with
interest income or expense credited or charged to the contract deposits and included in net
investment income or fee income. These contract deposits are included in &#147;Other assets&#148; and
&#147;Deposit liabilities&#148; in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 1%"><U><B>Deferred Acquisition Costs</B></U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquisition costs consist primarily of commission and brokerage expenses incurred in
connection with contract issuance, net of acquisition costs ceded and fee income. These costs are
deferred and amortized to income over the period in which the related premiums are earned.
Deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to determine that they do not exceed recoverable amounts,
after considering investment income.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 1%"><U><B>Fee Income</B></U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fee income is recorded as earned evenly over the contract period under various arrangements
whereby PXRE acts as underwriting manager for other insurers and reinsurers. These fees are
initially based on premium volume, but are adjusted in some cases through contingent profit
commissions related to underwriting results. In addition, fees are earned from certain finite
contracts accounted for as deposits.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 1%"><U><B>Losses and Loss Expenses</B></U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reserve for losses and loss expenses is established equal to an amount estimated to settle
ultimate incurred losses. The reserve for losses and loss expenses includes an estimate of
individual case reserves for reported losses for known events and an estimate of incurred but not
reported losses. Individual case reserve estimates are initially based on loss reports received
from third parties. The reserve for incurred but not reported losses consists of a provision for
additional development in excess of the case reserves reported by ceding companies and a provision
for claims which have occurred but which have not yet been reported to PXRE and is based on
actuarial methods. For certain catastrophic events there is considerable uncertainty underlying
the assumptions used to estimate the reserve for losses and loss expenses. Accordingly, ultimate
losses and loss expenses may vary materially from the amounts provided in the consolidated
financial statements. These estimates are reviewed regularly, and as experience develops and new
information becomes known the reserves are adjusted as necessary. Such adjustments, if any,
are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Operations in the
period in which they become known.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses are reported as assets. Reinsurance
recoverable on paid losses represents amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires at the end of the
period for assumed losses previously paid. Reinsurance recoverables are recognized in a manner
consistent with the underlying loss and loss expense reserve.
Provisions are established for all
reinsurance recoveries that are considered doubtful.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liabilities on assumed retroactive reinsurance contracts are established for the estimated
loss PXRE ultimately expects to pay out. If such losses are greater than the related assumed
earned premium, a deferred charge is recorded and included in &#147;Other assets&#148; in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Reinsurance recoverables on ceded retroactive reinsurance contracts are recorded
for the estimated recovery that PXRE ultimately expects to receive. If such recoverables are
greater than the related ceded earned premium, a deferred gain is recorded and included in &#147;Other
liabilities&#148; in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred charge or gain is amortized over the
estimated remaining settlement periods using the interest method. When changes in the amount or
the timing of payments on retroactive balances occur, a cumulative amortization adjustment is
recognized in earnings in the period of the change.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One ceded contract entered into by PXRE has been determined to be a derivative and is

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed maturity investments are considered available-for-sale or trading and are reported at
fair value. Fixed maturity investments are stated at fair value as determined by the quoted market
price of these securities as provided by either independent pricing services or, when such prices
are not available, by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications. Unrealized gains and
losses associated with the available-for-sale portfolio, as a result of temporary changes in fair
value during the period such investments are held, are reflected net of income taxes and reported
in other comprehensive operations as a separate component of shareholders&#146; equity. Unrealized
losses associated with the available-for-sale portfolio that are deemed other than temporary are
charged to operations in the period they are determined. Unrealized gains and losses associated
with the trading portfolio are recognized in net investment income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short-term investments, which have an original maturity of one year or less, are carried at
amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investments in limited partnership hedge funds and other limited partnerships are reported
under the equity method, which includes the cost of the investment and subsequent proportional
share of the partnership earnings. Under the equity method, earnings are recorded in net
investment income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realized gains or losses on disposition of investments are determined on the basis of specific
identification. The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for fixed maturity
investments are computed utilizing the interest method. The effective yield under the interest
method is adjusted for anticipated prepayments and extensions. Such adjustments, if any, are
included in net investment income in the period in which they are determined.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair values of certain assets and liabilities are based on published market values, if

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of other assets and other liabilities approximates their carrying value due to
their relative short term nature. The estimates of fair value are subjective in nature and are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts that PXRE would actually realize in a current market
exchange. However, any differences would not be expected to be material. Certain financial
instruments such as insurance contracts are excluded from fair value disclosure; therefore the
total fair value amounts cannot be aggregated to determine the underlying economic value of PXRE.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management has reviewed PXRE&#146;s deferred tax asset and due to uncertainty with respect to the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic earnings per share is determined by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. On a diluted basis, both net earnings and shares
outstanding are adjusted to reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities

converted into common shares or resulted in the issuance of common shares that then shared in the
earnings of the entity, unless the effect of the assumed conversion is anti-dilutive.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At January&nbsp;1, 2006, PXRE adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123R &#147;Share-Based Payment&#148; (&#147;SFAS 123R&#148;) issued in December
2004, using the modified prospective application method. SFAS 123R establishes standards for the
accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or
services and for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment
transactions. Under SFAS 123R, compensation costs are recognized for the fair value of all
share-based compensation over their remaining vesting period, including the cost related to the
unvested portion of all outstanding share-based compensation as of December&nbsp;31, 2005. Previously,
PXRE accounted for its share-based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement
principles of the Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25, &#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees&#148;, and related Interpretations. No share-based compensation cost related to the options
granted under the plans was reflected in net income (loss)&nbsp;prior to the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2006. PXRE&#146;s adoption of SFAS 123R did not and has not had a material effect on net income.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September, 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;158,
&#147;Employers&#146; Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans&#148; (&#147;SFAS 158&#148;), an
amendment of SFAS No.&nbsp;87, 88, 106 and 132R. This statement represents the completion of the first
phase in the FASB&#146;s postretirement benefits accounting project and requires an entity to recognize
in its statement of financial position an asset for a defined benefit postretirement plan&#146;s
overfunded status or a liability for a plan&#146;s underfunded status, measure a defined benefit
postretirement plan&#146;s assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the
employer&#146;s fiscal year and recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit
postretirement plan in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. The statement
does not change the amount of net periodic benefit cost included in net income or address the
various measurement issues associated with postretirement benefit plan accounting. PXRE adopted
the portion of the statement which requires recognition of the funded status of a defined benefit
postretirement plan and the disclosure requirements as of December&nbsp;31, 2006. The adoption of this
statement resulted in PXRE recording a charge of $0.7&nbsp;million in &#147;Accumulated other comprehensive
loss&#148; in its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2006. The requirement to measure plan
assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer&#146;s fiscal year-end balance sheet is
effective for fiscal years ending after December&nbsp;15, 2008.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
September&nbsp;2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB)
No.&nbsp;108, &#147;Considering the Effects of Prior Year
Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
Financial Statements&#148; (&#147;SAB&nbsp;108&#148;). SAB&nbsp;108
requires that companies assess the impact on both the balance sheet
and the statement of operations when quantifying and evaluating the
materiality of a misstatement. Under SAB&nbsp;108, adjustment of the
financial statements is required when either approach results in
quantifying a misstatement that is material to a reporting period
presented within the financial statements, after considering all
relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The impact on adopting
SAB&nbsp;108 was determined by the Company to be immaterial and does
not require previously filed reports to be amended. The provisions of
SAB&nbsp;108 must be applied to financial statements for fiscal years
ending after November&nbsp;15, 2006.</div>

2006 have been adjusted for immaterial errors with respect to the
anti-dilutive nature of convertible preferred share dividends and
therefore the amounts presented herein do not agree with previously
issued consolidated financial statements.</div>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><B>New Accounting Pronouncements</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;155,
&#147;Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments &#150; an amendment of FASB Statements No.&nbsp;133 and
140&#148; (&#147;SFAS 155&#148;). This Statement amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;133
&#147;Accounting for Derivatives Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148; (&#147;SFAS 133&#148;) and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;140 &#147;Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishment of Liabilities&#148; (&#147;SFAS 140&#148;). This Statement permits fair value remeasurement
for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would
require bifurcation; clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject
to the requirements of SFAS 133; establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized
financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid
financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation; clarifies that
concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives; and amends
SFAS 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a
derivative financial instrument that pertains to be a beneficial interest other than another
derivative financial instrument. In January&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued implementation guidance,
&#147;Statement 133 Implementation Issue B40 Embedded Derivatives: Application of Paragraph 13(b) to
Securitized Interests in Prepayable Financial Assets&#148;, which creates a scope exception with respect
to accounting for prepayment risk within certain securitized financial assets as an embedded
derivative. SFAS 155 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;48, &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes&#148;, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109 (&#147;FIN 48&#148;). FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The
relevant company is to determine whether it is more likely than not that the position would be
sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not
threshold are then measured using a probability weighted approach recognizing the largest amount of
tax benefit that is greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN
48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2006. The Company is currently
evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of FIN 48 will have on its consolidated financial
statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;157 &#147;Fair
Value Measurements&#148; (&#147;SFAS 157&#148;). This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. This statement also provides guidance for using fair value to
measure assets and liabilities. The Statement applies whenever assets or liabilities are required
or permitted to be measured at fair value under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The
Statement does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. The Statement is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007. The
Company is currently evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on its
consolidated financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Premiums written were assumed principally through reinsurance brokers or intermediaries.
In each of 2006, 2005 and 2004, four reinsurance intermediaries individually accounted for more
than 10% of gross premiums written, and collectively accounted for approximately 89%, 80% and 78%
of gross premiums written, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in both gross premiums written and gross premiums earned for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2006 was primarily due to the cancellation and non-renewal of the majority of our
reinsurance portfolio following our ratings downgrades in February&nbsp;2006. During the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2006, gross written and earned reinstatement premiums were negative $1.7&nbsp;million.
During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005 reinstatement premiums of $159.5&nbsp;million, including $151.7
million of reinstatement premiums from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, were written and earned.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE purchases catastrophe retrocessional coverage for its own protection, depending on market
conditions. PXRE purchases reinsurance primarily to reduce its exposure to severe losses related
to any one event or catastrophe. In 2006, PXRE had reinsurance treaties in place with several
different coverages, territories, limits and retentions that serve to reduce a large gross loss
emanating from any one event. PXRE also purchased clash reinsurance protection which allows PXRE
to recover losses ceded by more than one reinsured related to any one particular property,
primarily related to PXRE&#146;s exposure assumed on per-risk treaties. In 2005, PXRE sponsored two
catastrophe bond transactions that supported two collateralized facilities which provide the
Company with protection against certain severe catastrophe events and the occurrence of multiple
significant catastrophe events during the same year. One of those two collateralized facilities
was determined to be a derivative and is therefore recorded at fair value on PXRE&#146;s Consolidated
Balance Sheets with the changes in fair value reported in &#147;Other reinsurance related expense&#148; on
PXRE&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Operations for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease in both ceded premiums written and ceded premiums earned during 2006 as compared
to the prior year was largely due to $107.8&nbsp;million of ceded reinstatement and additional premiums
related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma recognized during 2005 compared to virtually none in 2006. The decrease was offset, in part,
by an increase of $57.7&nbsp;million and $57.0&nbsp;million in ceded premiums written and ceded premiums
earned, respectively, largely associated with excess of loss retrocessional catastrophe coverage
purchased during 2006, including one of the collateralized catastrophe facilities entered into
during the fourth quarter of 2005 to protect the Company against a severe catastrophe event and the
related early termination charge of approximately $17.6&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that retrocessionaires are unable to meet their contractual obligation, PXRE
would remain liable for the underlying covered claims and therefore the Company evaluates the
financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk. The Company
records a provision for uncollectible underlying reinsurance recoverable when collection becomes
unlikely.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2006, PXRE had balances with an insurer, Legion Insurance Company (&#147;Legion&#148;),
which has been in liquidation, amounting to $3.2&nbsp;million of premiums receivable, net of contingent
commission. PXRE also had loss and loss expense liabilities due to Legion of $16.2&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2006. PXRE&#146;s reinsurance contracts with Legion contain offset clauses whose
enforceability is subject to Pennsylvania law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE has had both ceded and assumed reinsurance contracts that involve the withholding of
premiums by the cedent or PXRE, as the case may be. On assumed reinsurance contracts, cedents held
premiums and accrued investment income for which we have recognized $0.9&nbsp;million of investment
income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004. The assumed reinsurance contract was commuted during
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004. On September&nbsp;30, 2006, the last of the ceded reinsurance
contracts was commuted and the underlying funds withheld balances were settled with the reinsurers
that were a party to the contract. Prior to the commutation and as of December&nbsp;31, 2005, PXRE held
premiums and accrued investment income of $86.4&nbsp;million due to reinsurers. This amount is
included, net of related receivables, under the caption, &#147;Reinsurance balances payable&#148; in the
Company&#146;s 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet. PXRE owed fixed rates of interest to the
retrocessionaires for these funds withheld arrangements, and on a weighted average basis such rates
during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were 7.1%, 7.7% and 7.4%, respectively.
Under the ceded reinsurance arrangements, PXRE reduced investment income during the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 by $4.7&nbsp;million, $6.7&nbsp;million and $8.0&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included
in the decrease in the Deposit Liability from $68.3 million at
December 31, 2005 to $54.4 million at December 31, 2006, was $5.9
million on commuted contracts.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included
in the $655.6 million of net paid prior year losses and loss expenses
for 2006 is $587.6 million of paid losses and loss expenses for
significant catastrophes including commutations of some
contracts.</div>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the business written by PXRE is characterized by high severity and relatively low
frequency, this may result in volatility in its financial results. For the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2005, current year net losses incurred of $987.6&nbsp;million were mainly due to the 2005 hurricanes
which amounted to $638.0&nbsp;million from Hurricane Katrina, $68.9&nbsp;million from Hurricane Rita and
$143.9&nbsp;million from Hurricane Wilma.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our loss estimates for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma are subject to a high level of
uncertainty due to the short period of time that has passed since Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and
Wilma occurred, and the extremely complex and unique causation and coverage issues associated with
Hurricane Katrina, including the appropriate attribution of losses to wind or flood damage as
opposed to other perils such as fire, business interruption or civil commotion. The underlying
personal lines policies generally contain exclusions for flood damage; however, water damage caused
by wind may be covered. We expect that causation and coverage issues may not be resolved for a
considerable period of time and may be influenced by evolving legal
and regulatory developments. If such lawsuits were to successfully
invalidate the underlying flood damage exclusions or if the court or a
jury were to find that an insurer had not adequately established that a
loss was attributable to flood rather than wind, our liabilities for
losses and loss expenses relating to Hurricane Katrina could prove to
be inadequate, with a consequent adverse impact on our earnings and
shareholders&#146; equity in future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2006, PXRE experienced net favorable development of $10.4&nbsp;million for prior-year losses
and loss expenses, comprised of $16.3&nbsp;million of favorable development in the catastrophe and risk
excess segment and $5.9&nbsp;million of adverse development in the exited lines segment. The $16.3
million of prior year favorable development in the catastrophe and risk excess segment was
primarily related to favorable reported loss activity on our prior-year non-significant catastrophe
losses. During 2006, there was no material change to our estimate of net losses and loss expenses
for Hurricanes Katrina,
Rita and Wilma. Prior year losses in the exited lines segment increased because of higher
than expected reported claims.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2005, PXRE experienced net adverse development of $23.9&nbsp;million for prior-year
 losses
and loss expenses, comprised of $17.3&nbsp;million of adverse development in the catastrophe and risk
excess segment and $6.6&nbsp;million of adverse development in the exited lines segment. The $17.3
million of prior year development in the catastrophe and risk excess segment was primarily related
to re-estimation of the 2004 storm losses following additional claim reports from cedents. Prior
year losses in the exited lines segment increased because of higher than expected reported claims.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2004, PXRE experienced net adverse development of $12.0&nbsp;million for prior-year losses
and loss expenses, comprised of $11.4&nbsp;million catastrophe and risk excess net favorable development
and $23.4&nbsp;million exited lines net adverse development. The favorable development in the
catastrophe and risk excess business was primarily related to case reserve takedowns from past
significant catastrophes, such as the 2002 European floods. The $23.4&nbsp;million net adverse
development related to exited lines was due primarily to $13.7&nbsp;million of adverse loss development
on an aggregate excess of loss contract with Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company (&#147;LMC&#148;). During
the fourth quarter of 2004, this contract was commuted. The Company also experienced $19.7&nbsp;million
of adverse development on exited direct casualty reinsurance operations. The primary cause of the
adverse development was higher than expected reported losses in 2004. Favorable development in
other exited lines partially offset the adverse development experienced on the contract with LMC
and direct casualty reinsurance operations. During the third and fourth quarters of 2004, the
Company completed commutations of two exited direct general liability reinsurance programs, the
first resulting in a $2.0&nbsp;million reduction in incurred losses and the second in a $1.0&nbsp;million
increase in incurred losses.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE regularly monitors the difference between the estimated fair values of investments
and their cost or book values to identify underperforming investments and
whether declines in value are temporary in nature, or &#147;other than temporary.&#148; If a decline in
the value of a particular investment is deemed to be temporary, the decline is recorded as an
unrealized loss, net of tax, in shareholders&#146; equity. If the decline is &#147;other than temporary,&#148;
the carrying value of the investment is written down and a realized loss is recorded on the
statement of operations. The Company formally reviews each quarter the unrealized losses by value,
and all investments that have been in an unrealized loss position for more than six months. In
assessing whether an investment is suffering a decline in value that is &#147;other than temporary,&#148;
particular attention is paid to those trading at 80% or less of original cost, and those
investments that have been downgraded by any of the major ratings agencies, general market
conditions, and the status of principal and interest payments, and our ability and intent to hold
such securities to maturity. If a decline is deemed to be &#147;other than temporary,&#148; a realized
investment loss is recognized for the impairment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table summarizes fixed maturity investments with unrealized losses at fair value
by length of continuous unrealized loss position as of December&nbsp;31, 2006:

the third and fourth quarters of 2006. The other than temporary impairment charges recorded in the
current year relate to investments that the Company may not have the ability to hold to maturity or
recovery as a result of the ratings downgrades of PXRE that occurred in February&nbsp;2006.

unrealized losses are primarily due to increases in interest rates since the purchase dates for

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fourth quarter of 2005, we sold PXRE Limited, the sole corporate capital provider to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to fixed maturities, PXRE held $671.2&nbsp;million and $261.1&nbsp;million of
short-term investments at December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, comprised principally of
corporate securities, treasury bills and agency securities. The increase in short-term investments
reflects the re-deployment of securities following the downgrades in PXRE&#146;s ratings in February
2006, in order to have sufficient liquidity to meet the currently foreseen needs of PXRE&#146;s
counterparties and to increase the Company&#146;s flexibility in its pursuit of various strategic
alternatives.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to, and as a result of the downgrades in our ratings that occurred in February
2006, PXRE executed redemption orders for all of the company&#146;s hedge fund investments. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2006, PXRE remained beneficial owners of Loeb Offshore Fund, Ltd. and Riva Ridge
Overseas Fund, Ltd. All other hedge fund
investments, including Mariner Select International, Ltd., represent redemption &#147;holdback&#148;
receivables which are expected to be released by the hedge funds upon completion of their annual
audits. These receivable balances do not share in the gains or losses of the related hedge funds
and therefore represent no beneficial ownership in those funds.

unearned premiums. Cash and investments with a fair value of $329.5&nbsp;million have been pledged as

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2006, PXRE has deposited cash and securities with a fair value of $53.9

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in Note 3, PXRE entered into an agreement that provides $250.0&nbsp;million of
collateralized catastrophe protection with Atlantic &#038; Western Re Limited II, a special purpose
Cayman Islands reinsurance company which was funded through a catastrophe bond transaction. This
coverage was effective January&nbsp;1, 2006 and provides the Company with second event coverage arising
from hurricanes in the Eastern and Gulf coasts of the United States, windstorms in northern Europe
and earthquakes in California. The coverage is based on a modeled loss trigger. Upon the
occurrence of a loss event, if the modeled loss exceeds the attachment point for the peril, the
coverage is activated. Upon the occurrence of a second loss event during the same calendar year,
if the modeled loss exceeds the attachment point, PXRE will make recovery under the agreement. The
recovery is based on modeled losses and is not limited to PXRE&#146;s ultimate net loss from the loss
event. The coverage provided $250.0&nbsp;million of protection for the period from January&nbsp;1, 2006 to
December&nbsp;31, 2006 and provides $125.0&nbsp;million for the period from January&nbsp;1, 2007 to December&nbsp;31,
2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE records this contract at fair value and such fair value is included in &#147;Other assets&#148; and
&#147;Other liabilities&#148; in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets with any changes in the value
reflected in &#147;Other reinsurance related expense&#148; in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Operations. As there is no quoted market value available for this derivative, the
fair value is estimated by management taking into account changes in the market for catastrophe
bond reinsurance contracts with similar economic characteristics and potential recoveries from
events preceding the valuation date. The amount recognized could be materially different from the
actual recoveries
received under this contract. Included in &#147;Other reinsurance related expense&#148; for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 was $17.9&nbsp;million which was due to the change in the fair value of this
derivative, principally due to the passage of one year of the transaction&#146;s risk coverage for 2006.
Included in other reinsurance related expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005 was $0.9
million which consisted solely of upfront transaction costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reinsurance company that is the counterparty to this transaction is a variable interest
entity under the provisions of FIN 46R. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of this entity
and is therefore not required to consolidate it in its consolidated financial statements.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company had the following equity securities outstanding: (i)&nbsp;63.5
million common shares, (ii)&nbsp;8.9&nbsp;million convertible voting common shares, and (iii)&nbsp;5,813
convertible voting preferred shares.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;7, 2005, PXRE completed the public offering of 8.8&nbsp;million of its common shares,
including 1.2&nbsp;million shares sold upon exercise of the underwriter&#146;s overallotment option in full,
at a public offering price of $13.25 per share. Net proceeds to the Company from the common stock
offering, after deducting estimated expenses and underwriter&#146;s discounts and commissions, were
approximately $114.7&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated as of September&nbsp;29, 2005, PXRE agreed to issue
and sell 375,000 Series&nbsp;D Perpetual Non-Voting Preferred Shares (the &#147;Series&nbsp;D Preferred Shares&#148;)
in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The Series&nbsp;D
Preferred Shares were mandatorily exchangeable for common shares upon the shareholders&#146; approval of
the exchange. The private placement closed on October&nbsp;7, 2005. The gross proceeds from the
private placement were $375.0&nbsp;million, and proceeds net of agents&#146; discounts and commissions and
offering expenses were $359.3&nbsp;million. The Series&nbsp;D Preferred Shares were mandatorily exchanged
into 32.3&nbsp;million common shares and 1.8 milion convertible voting common shares following the
affirmative vote of the Company&#146;s shareholders at a special general meeting held on November&nbsp;18,
2005 approving the exchange of the Series&nbsp;D Preferred Shares and the authorization of an additional
300&nbsp;million common shares. No Series&nbsp;D Preferred Shares were outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE contributed the $474.0&nbsp;million net proceeds of the public offering and the private
placement to PXRE Bermuda to support the underwriting of reinsurance business during subsequent
renewal periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;31, 2005, 5,840.6 Series&nbsp;A1 convertible voting preferred shares, 3,143.6 Series&nbsp;B1
convertible voting preferred shares and 1,393.6 Series&nbsp;C1 convertible voting preferred shares were
mandatorily converted into 4.4&nbsp;million class A convertible voting common shares, 2.4&nbsp;million class
B convertible voting common shares and 1.0&nbsp;million class C convertible voting common shares,
respectively. The conversion was effected based upon a conversion price of $13.27, which
conversion price was agreed between the Company and holders of the Company&#146;s convertible voting
preferred shares pursuant to a letter agreement dated as of March&nbsp;31, 2005. All the remaining
convertible preferred shares mandatorily convert by April&nbsp;4, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each convertible voting common share converts into one common share upon sale to a third
party.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convertible preferred shares accrue cumulative dividends per share at the rate per annum
of 8% of the sum of the stated value of each share plus any accrued and unpaid dividend thereon
payable on a quarterly basis. Commencing in the second quarter of 2005, the dividends paid on such
convertible voting preferred shares are paid in cash, rather than in additional convertible voting
preferred shares. No dividends were paid in the first quarter of 2006, and
therefore overdue dividends were accrued at 10% per annum from April&nbsp;1, 2006 until paid on May
30, 2006.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005, 5,813 convertible preferred shares were outstanding, which
were convertible into 5.1&nbsp;million common shares. Convertible preferred shares are convertible into
convertible common shares at the option of the holder at any time at a conversion price equal to
the original conversion price, subject to certain dilution adjustments. The number of convertible
common shares issued upon the conversion of each convertible preferred share would be equal to the
sum of the original purchase price ($10,000) of such convertible preferred share plus accrued but
unpaid dividends divided by the adjusted conversion price. The conversion price is subject to
adjustment to avoid dilution in the event of recapitalization, reclassification, stock split,
consolidation, merger, amalgamation or other similar event or an issuance of additional common
shares in a private placement below the fair market value or in a registered public offering below
95% of fair market value (in each case, fair market value being the value immediately prior to the
date of announcement of such issuance) or without consideration. As a result of the issuance of
8.8&nbsp;million common shares in October&nbsp;2005 at the price of $13.25 per share pursuant to a public
offering of common shares and the issuance of 34.1&nbsp;million common shares upon the exchange of the
Series&nbsp;D Perpetual Preferred Shares at the exchange price of $11.00 per share, the conversion price
on the Preferred Shares was adjusted downwards by $1.75 in accordance with the terms of the
underlying share purchase agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the conversion price is subject to adjustment, for certain loss and loss expense
development on reserves for losses incurred on or before September&nbsp;30, 2001 (and loss adjustment
expenses related thereto) and for any liability or loss arising out of pending material litigation
(other than legal fees and expenses), on an after-tax basis, equal to an amount computed in
accordance with a formula as set forth in the Description of Stock. Adjustments occur if the
development exceeds a deductible after-tax threshold of $7.0&nbsp;million and, with respect to all
reserves other than reserves for certain discontinued operations and the events of September&nbsp;11,
2001 and liability arising out of pending litigation, the adjustment is limited to $12.0&nbsp;million of
further development. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, PXRE has incurred $40.5million of net adverse
development above this $7.0&nbsp;million threshold. As a result of this, and the anti-dilution
adjustment discussed above, as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the adjusted conversion price was $11.28.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;23, 2004, PXRE completed a public offering of 5.2&nbsp;million of its common shares at
$23.75 per share, consisting of 3.7&nbsp;million shares offered by the Company and 1.5&nbsp;million shares
offered by certain selling shareholders. The underwriters were given an option to purchase up to
an additional 0.8&nbsp;million common shares, 0.7&nbsp;million from the Company and 0.1&nbsp;million from the
selling shareholders, solely to cover overallotments, if any, which option they exercised on
December&nbsp;2, 2004.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
shareholders. The selling shareholders converted 2,208 preferred shares, including accrued
dividends to 1.6&nbsp;million common shares sold in the public offering, including the overallotment.
Net proceeds to the Company from the sale of common shares sold by the Company were approximately
$98.2&nbsp;million, including the overallotment. PXRE used the net proceeds for
general corporate purposes, including contributions to the capital of PXRE Bermuda to support
growth in its business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absent a specific waiver by PXRE&#146;s Board of Directors, the Company&#146;s Bye-Laws restrict the
ownership and voting rights of any shareholder who directly or indirectly would own
 more than 9.9%
of the outstanding common shares of the Company. The restriction requires the prompt disposition
of any shares held in violation of the provision and limits the voting power of a shareholder with
more than 9.9% of the outstanding shares to the voting power of a shareholder with 9.9% of the
outstanding common shares.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;4, 2002, the Company raised $150.0&nbsp;million of additional capital by issuing 15,000
convertible voting preferred shares in a private placement not involving a public offering under
Section&nbsp;4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The convertible preferred share investment
occurred pursuant to a share purchase agreement, dated as of December&nbsp;10, 2001, between the Company
and certain investors. On February&nbsp;12, 2002, the shareholders approved the sale and issuance of
three series of convertible preferred shares pursuant to the share purchase agreement, including
7,500 Series&nbsp;A convertible preferred shares, 5,000 Series&nbsp;B convertible preferred shares, and 2,500
Series&nbsp;C convertible preferred shares. Proceeds of the offering of the convertible preferred
shares, net of offering expenses of $9.1&nbsp;million, amounted to $140.9&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the preferred shares, the payment of dividends on the Company&#146;s common
shares is subject to the following limitations: (i)&nbsp;no dividend may be paid upon the common shares
if the dividends payable upon the preferred shares are overdue; (ii)&nbsp;the amount of dividends paid
with respect to the common shares may not be increased by a cumulative annualized rate of more than
10% at any time prior to April&nbsp;4, 2005 (the &#147;Permitted Dividend Amount&#148;) without the consent of the
majority of holders of the preferred shares; and (iii)&nbsp;at any time on or after April&nbsp;4, 2005, no
dividend may be paid that would result in payment of any dividend or other distribution with
respect to common shares or result in a redemption, offer to purchase, tender offer or other
acquisition of capital stock of the Company involving consideration having an aggregate fair value
in excess of the greater of the Permitted Tender Offer Amount and the Permitted Dividend Amount.
For this purpose, the term &#147;Permitted Tender Offer Amount&#148; means an amount equal to 20% of the
cumulative amount by which consolidated net income in any calendar year commencing with the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2002 exceeds $50.0&nbsp;million minus the sum of all cash and the fair value of all
non-cash consideration paid in respect of redemptions, offers to purchase, tender offers or other
acquisitions of capital stock on or after December&nbsp;10, 2001.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a Special General Meeting held November&nbsp;18, 2005 the shareholders of PXRE approved certain
changes to the Share Capital of the Company, including the authorization of additional common
shares. This approval increased the authorized share capital from $60.0&nbsp;million to $360.0&nbsp;million
and increased the number of authorized common shares from 50.0&nbsp;million to 350.0&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the shareholders approved an increase in the authorized share capital by $20.0
million and an increase in the number of authorized Preferred Shares by an additional 20.0&nbsp;million
shares to 30.0&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shareholders also approved the division of 30.0&nbsp;million of PXRE&#146;s 300.0&nbsp;million newly
authorized common shares into three pre-existing classes of common shares (collectively,
&#147;Convertible Common Shares&#148;): 10.0&nbsp;million additional Class&nbsp;A Convertible Voting Common Shares
(&#147;Class&nbsp;A Convertible Common Shares&#148;); 10.0&nbsp;million additional Class&nbsp;B Convertible Voting Common

of PXRE Barbados to PXRE Bermuda, and during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, contributed the
remaining portion. During 2005, PXRE Ireland assumed ownership of all company subsidiaries that
were previously owned by PXRE Barbados. PXRE Ireland is a wholly owned subsidiary of PXRE Bermuda.
As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, PXRE Bermuda has assets on its statutory balance sheet equal to $51.7
million which consists of investments in subsidiaries as well as amounts due from its parent
company, PXRE Group Ltd.

require PXRE Bermuda to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity. As of December&nbsp;31,
2006, the statutory capital and surplus of PXRE Bermuda was estimated to be $564.2&nbsp;million and the
amount required to be maintained was estimated to be $100.0&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE has a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan covering all U.S. employees with one
year or more of service and who had attained age 21. Benefits are generally based on years of
service and compensation. PXRE funds the plan in amounts not less than the minimum statutory
funding requirement nor more than the maximum amount that can be
deducted for U.S. income tax purposes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE also sponsors a supplemental executive retirement plan. This plan is non-qualified and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investment policy of the fund for the retirement plan seeks to manage the fund with a
long-term objective, of seven years or more, and achieve the highest practicable long-term rate of
return without taking excessive risk that could jeopardize PXRE&#146;s funding policy or subject PXRE to
undue funding volatility. The objective of the investment policy is for the assets funded to
achieve a rate of return over any seven-year period that exceeds the rate of inflation by 5% after
the cost of managing and administering the plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;158, &#147;Employers&#146; Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans&#148;, an amendment of SFAS No.&nbsp;87, 88,
 106 and 132R.
This statement represents the completion of the first phase in the FASB&#146;s postretirement benefits
accounting project and requires an entity to recognize in its statement of financial position an
asset for a defined benefit postretirement plan&#146;s overfunded status or a liability for a plan&#146;s
underfunded status, measure a defined benefit postretirement plan&#146;s assets and obligations that
determine its funded status as of the end of the employer&#146;s fiscal year and recognize changes in
the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in comprehensive income in the year in
which the changes occur. The statement does not change the amount of net periodic benefit cost
included in net income or address the various measurement issues associated with postretirement
benefit plan accounting. PXRE adopted the portion of the statement which requires recognition of
the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and the disclosure requirements as of
December&nbsp;31, 2006. The adoption of this statement resulted in PXRE recording a charge of $0.7
million in &#147;Accumulated other comprehensive loss&#148; in its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December
31, 2006. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the
employer&#146;s fiscal year-end balance sheet is effective for fiscal years ending after December&nbsp;15,
2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2005 and 2004, there were settlements with four and three former employees,

In addition, PXRE may contribute profit-sharing up to 3% of each employee&#146;s salary. During 2006,
2005 and 2004, PXRE incurred expenses from this plan of $0.5&nbsp;million, $0.7&nbsp;million and $0.7

awards will be granted under the 2004 Bonus Plan with respect to performance on a number of
criteria compared to target criteria, including return on equity, certain expense ratios and
reserve adequacy as well as a discretionary component related to individual performance.
Under the 2004 Bonus Plan, bonuses are paid in cash up to the amount of each employee&#146;s target
bonus. For certain senior executives and above, 30% of any bonus amount in excess of target bonus
is paid in restricted shares which cliff vest after 3&nbsp;years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the adoption of the 2004 Bonus Plan, the Company provided annual bonus compensation
to employees through the Restated Employee Annual Incentive Bonus Plan (the &#147;Terminated Bonus
Plan&#148;). Under the Terminated Bonus Plan, incentive compensation to employees was based in part on
return on equity compared to a target return on equity and in part at the discretion of the
Restated Bonus Plan Committee. The Restated Employee Annual Incentive Bonus Plan was terminated
effective December&nbsp;31, 2003. The maximum
 compensation paid in any year was limited to 150% of
target bonuses under the Terminated Bonus Plan. Amounts incurred above 150% of target up to a
maximum award at 240% of target represented contingent incentive compensation. In addition, 30% of
all bonus amounts paid to officers under the Terminated Bonus Plan were paid in restricted shares
that cliff vest after 3&nbsp;years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company awards long-term equity compensation pursuant to its 1992 Officer Incentive Plan
and 2002 Officer Incentive Plan, which provides for the grant of incentive share options,
non-qualified share options and awards of restricted shares. Options granted under the plan have a
term of 10&nbsp;years and generally become exercisable in four equal annual installments commencing one
year from the date of grant. The exercise price for the incentive share options must be equal to
or exceed the fair market value of the common shares on the date the option is granted. The
exercise price for the non-qualified options may not be less than the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant. No options have been granted under the plan since 2003.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006, 2005 and 2004, $1.1&nbsp;million, $6.2&nbsp;million, and $6.5&nbsp;million, respectively, was
incurred as expense under these plans, including bonuses granted to certain levels of employees
paid in restricted shares, which vest at the end of 3&nbsp;years or at each annual anniversary date over
4&nbsp;years. The restricted shares are expensed pro-rata from the grant date to the final anniversary
date of the grant. No income tax benefit was recognized for share-based compensation arrangements
in 2006 and 2005.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE has adopted a non-employee Director Stock Plan, which provides for an annual grant
of 5,000 options and 1,000 restricted shares per non-employee director from 2000 to 2003 and 5,000
options and 2,500 restricted shares per director from 2004 to 2005. In 2006, only 3,574 options
and 2,500 restricted shares were granted to each director due to the limited number of authorized
shares remaining under the Director Stock Plan. Restricted shares vest at each annual anniversary
date over 3&nbsp;years. Options granted under the plan have a term of 10&nbsp;years from the date of grant
and are exercisable in three equal annual installments commencing one year from the date of grant.
The exercise price of the options is the fair market value on the date of grant. Under this plan,
as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, options for 500,000 shares were authorized,
 273,833 were outstanding and
199,617 were exercisable, at exercise prices between $14.79 and $31.11.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE allows its directors to elect to convert their Board of Directors retainer fee to options
under the Directors Equity and Deferred Compensation Plan. Under this plan, at December&nbsp;31, 2006,
options for 250,000 shares were authorized and 83,627 were outstanding at prices ranging from
$12.81 to $33.46 which are 100% vested and immediately exercisable for a period of 10&nbsp;years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, total authorized common shares reserved for grants of employee and
director share options and restricted shares under the above plans are 2,564,846 shares. Total
shares of 1,085,305 relate to share options which are vested and exercisable at December&nbsp;31, 2006
at exercise prices between $12.50 and $33.46. All options become exercisable upon a change of
control of PXRE as defined by the plans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At January&nbsp;1, 2006, PXRE adopted FASB SFAS 123R issued in December&nbsp;2004, using the modified
prospective application method. SFAS 123R establishes standards for the accounting for
transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and for
transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions.
Under SFAS 123R, compensation costs are recognized for the fair value of all share-based
compensation over their remaining vesting period, including the cost related to the unvested
portion of all outstanding share-based compensation as of December&nbsp;31, 2005. Previously, PXRE
accounted for its share-based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles
of the Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25, &#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees&#148;, and
related Interpretations. No share-based compensation cost related to the options granted under the
plans was reflected in net income (loss)&nbsp;prior to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006. PXRE&#146;s
adoption of SFAS 123R did not and has not had a material effect on net income.

related to unvested option share-based compensation arrangements and $3.0&nbsp;million of unvested
restricted share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Plans. Those costs are expected
to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 and 1.5&nbsp;years, respectively. The total fair
value of restricted shares vested during 2006 and 2005, was $3.9&nbsp;million and $3.0&nbsp;million,
respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE also had adopted a non-employee Director Deferred Share Plan granting 2,000 shares to
each non-employee Board member prior to 2003 at the times specified in the plan. This plan was
terminated effective January&nbsp;1, 2003. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, the 12,000 shares granted to eligible
non-employee Board members will be issued to Board members at their
termination.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE operates
in two reportable property and casualty segments &#151; (i) catastrophe
and risk excess and (ii) exited lines &#151; based on PXRE&#146;s approach
to managing the business. The exited lines segment includes business
previously written and classified by the Company as direct casualty,
Lloyd&#146;s of London (&#147;Lloyd&#146;s&#148;), International
casualty and finite. In addition, PXRE operates in two geographic
segments &#151; North American, representing North American based
risks written by North American based clients, and International
(principally worldwide risks including the United States, United
Kingdom, Continental Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, Bermuda,
Australia and Asia), representing all other premiums written.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no differences among the accounting policies of the segments as compared to PXRE&#146;s
consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE does not maintain separate balance sheet data for each of its operating segments nor does
it allocate net investment income, net realized investment gains or losses, other fee income, other
reinsurance related expense, operating expenses, foreign exchange gains and losses or interest
expense to these segments. Accordingly, PXRE does not review and evaluate the financial results of
its operating segments based upon balance sheet data and these other income statement items.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following tables summarize the net premiums written, net premiums earned and underwriting
income (loss)&nbsp;by PXRE&#146;s business segments. The amounts shown for the North American and
International geographic segments are presented net of proportional reinsurance and allocated
excess of loss reinsurance cessions, but gross of corporate catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance
cessions, which are separately itemized where applicable.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are unaudited quarterly results of operations on a consolidated basis for the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and 2005. Quarterly results necessarily rely heavily on estimates.
This and certain other factors, such as catastrophic losses, call for caution in drawing specific
conclusions from quarterly results. Due to changes in the number of average shares outstanding,
quarterly earnings per share may not add to the total for the year.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>15. Contingencies</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between May&nbsp;3, 2006 and June&nbsp;16, 2006, several class action lawsuits have been filed against
PXRE, Jeffrey Radke, the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, and John Modin, the Company&#146;s former
Chief Financial Officer, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf
of a putative class consisting of investors who purchased the publicly traded securities of PXRE
between July&nbsp;28, 2005 and February&nbsp;16, 2006. Each of the class action complaints asserts nearly
identical claims and alleges that during the purported class period certain PXRE executives made a
series of materially false and misleading statements or omissions about PXRE&#146;s business, prospects
and operations, thereby causing investors to purchase PXRE&#146;s securities at artificially inflated
prices, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the &#147;1934 Act&#148;), and Rule&nbsp;10b-5 promulgated under the
1934 Act. The class action complaints allege, among other things, that
 the Company failed to
disclose and misrepresented the following material adverse facts: (1)&nbsp;the full impact on PXRE&#146;s
business of hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma (the &#147;2005 Hurricanes&#148;); (2)&nbsp;the doubling of PXRE&#146;s
cost of the 2005 Hurricanes to an estimated $758&nbsp;million to $788&nbsp;million; and (3)&nbsp;the magnitude of
the loss to PXRE and PXRE&#146;s potential loss of its financial-strength and credit ratings from A.M.
Best. Further, the complaints allege, based on the foregoing asserted facts, that PXRE&#146;s
statements with respect to its loss estimates for the 2005 hurricane season lacked any reasonable
basis. The class actions seek an unspecified amount of damages, as well as other forms of relief.
A motion to appoint a lead plaintiff and consolidate all of the class actions into a single
proceeding is currently pending before the court.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;21, 2007, PXRE entered into a Tolling and Standstill Agreement with certain
institutional investors in connection with potential claims arising out of the Private Placement of
Series&nbsp;D Perpetual Non-voting Preferred Shares of PXRE that were sold pursuant to the Private
Placement Memorandum dated on or about September&nbsp;28, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PXRE has not established any reserves for any potential liability relating to the class action
lawsuits other than $1.0&nbsp;million for legal fees. The Company has insurance coverage with respect
to claims such as the class action lawsuits, but it is not currently possible to determine whether
such insurance coverage will be adequate to cover the Company&#146;s defense costs and any losses.
Unfavorable outcomes in the class action lawsuits, resulting in the payment of substantial damages
or fines or criminal penalties, could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s business,
cash flows, results of operations, financial position and prospects.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>16. Subsequent Event</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
March 14, 2007, the Board of Directors concluded its strategic alternative evaluation
process and announced that we had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger
Agreement&#148;) with Argonaut Group, Inc. (&#147;Argonaut&#148;). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
Argonaut will merge into a newly formed PXRE Group Ltd. subsidiary, PXMS, Inc. Upon completion of
the merger, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement which has been
unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both companies, Argonaut stockholders will
receive subject to certain adjustments 6.4672 shares of PXRE common stock in exchange for each share of Argonaut common stock.
Upon closing of the transaction, approximately 73% of PXRE&#146;s outstanding common stock will be
owned by former Argonaut stockholders, and approximately 27% by former holders of PXRE&#146;s common
stock and convertible voting preferred shares. Argonaut stock options and other equity awards will
automatically convert upon completion of the merger into stock options and equity awards with
respect to PXRE common stock, subject to adjustment to reflect the exchange ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon completion of the merger, PXRE will be renamed &#147;Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd.&#148;
and its common shares will be delisted from the New York Stock
Exchange and relisted on NASDAQ Global Market (&#147;NASDAQ&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completion of the merger, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2007, is subject
to various conditions, including (1)&nbsp;receipt of approvals of the holders of PXRE and Argonaut
common stock, (2)&nbsp;receipt of regulatory approvals, and (3)&nbsp;effectiveness of the Form S-4
registration statement relating to the PXRE common stock to be issued in the merger and listing
of the PXRE common stock on the NASDAQ.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and Argonaut. Under
certain circumstances, including those relating to competing business combination proposals,
termination of the merger agreement could obligate PXRE to pay a termination fee of $20&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently with the announcement of the merger, we also announced the formation of a new
Bermuda based reinsurance subsidiary, Peleus Reinsurance Ltd.
(&#147;Peleus Re&#148;) on March 14, 2007. Peleus Re has been
rated &#147;A-&#148; by A.M. Best &#038; Company and is expected to  begin writing reinsurance
business. Peleus Re will focus on underwriting medium to small commercial property reinsurance
risks on a pro rata and risk excess basis, and property catastrophe reinsurance risk on a
controlled basis. It is also expected to reinsure casualty risks,
initially through a quota share of Argonaut&#146;s existing
casualty business. Peleus Re will initially be capitalized with
$213&nbsp;million contributed from the existing
surplus of PXRE Bermuda. PXRE Bermuda and PXRE Reinsurance will be placed into an orderly runoff,
but will provide intercompany reinsurance support to Peleus Re.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
 our ratings downgrades in February 2006, we have maintained active communications with the
BMA. As a result of these communications PXRE has agreed to submit to additional regulatory
oversight by the BMA. We agreed that effective March 12, 2007 PXRE Bermuda will not write any
insurance business other than intra-group reinsurance in support of Peleus Re without the
approval of the BMA.
</div>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have
also agreed with the BMA that effective March 12, 2007, PXRE Bermuda before reducing its total
statutory capital by 10% or more, in the aggregate, as set out in its previous year&#146;s financial
statements, in any calendar year, shall apply to the BMA for its
approval. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, PXRE Bermuda may reduce its total statutory capital as set
out in its previous year&#146;s financial statements, by less than 10% in the aggregate
in any calendar year, provided that at least fourteen days before payment of such distribution
it files with the BMA a certificate signed by the insurer&#146;s principal representative and two of
its directors which states that, in the opinion of those signing the
certificate; the return and
reduction of statutory capital will not cause the insurer to fail to meet its relevant margins.
</div>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
PXRE Bermuda before declaring a dividend in respect of any financial year which would exceed 20%
of its total statutory capital and surplus, as shown on its statutory balance sheet in relation to
the previous financial year, must apply to the BMA for its approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
PXRE Bermuda may declare and pay dividends in respect of any financial year which would not exceed
20% of its total statutory capital and surplus, as shown on its statutory balance sheet in
relation to the previous financial year provided that at least fourteen days before payment of such dividend it files
with the BMA a certificate signed by its principal representative and two of its directors which
states, that in the opinion of those signing the certificate; the payment of such dividend will
not cause PXRE Bermuda to fail to meet its relevant margins.
