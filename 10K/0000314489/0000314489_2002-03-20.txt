ITEM  1.  BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION
     First Busey Corporation ("First Busey"), a Nevada Corporation, is a $1.3
billion financial holding company which was organized as a bank holding company
in 1980.  First Busey conducts a broad range of financial services through its
banking and non-banking subsidiaries at 21 locations.  First Busey is
headquartered in Urbana, Illinois and its stock is traded on the Nasdaq National
Market under the symbol "BUSE."

BANKING  AND  NON-BANKING  SUBSIDIARIES
     First Busey currently has two wholly owned banking subsidiaries located in
three states (the "Banks").  Busey Bank, a state-chartered bank organized in
1868, is a full service commercial bank offering a wide variety of services to
individual, business, institutional and governmental customers, including retail
products and services.  Busey Bank has 18 locations in Illinois and one in
Indianapolis, Indiana.

     First Busey acquired Eagle BancGroup, Inc., parent of First Federal Savings
& Loan Association ("First Federal"), in October, 1999.  First Federal, located
in Bloomington, Illinois, was established in 1919 as a federally chartered
capital stock savings association.  In June, 2000, First Federal changed its
name to Busey Bank fsb.  At the same time, four of Busey Bank's branches,
located in LeRoy and Bloomington, Illinois, were transferred into Busey Bank
fsb.  In October, 2000, Busey Bank fsb opened an additional branch in Fort
Myers, Florida.  In November, 2001, Busey Bank fsb transferred its charter to
Florida, and changed its name to Busey Bank Florida.  Simultaneously, the
Illinois assets of Busey Bank fsb were merged into Busey Bank.  Busey Bank
Florida, a federally chartered savings association, is a full service bank
offering commercial and retail banking services.  Busey Bank Florida has one
location in Fort Myers, Florida.

     The Banks offer a full range of banking services, including commercial,
financial, agricultural and real estate loans, and retail banking services,
including accepting customary types of demand and savings deposits, making
individual, consumer, installment, first mortgage and second mortgage loans,
offering money transfers, safe deposit services, IRA, Keogh and other fiduciary
services, automated banking and automated fund transfers.

     Busey Investment Group, Inc., located in Champaign, Illinois and formed in
February, 1999, is the parent company of: (1) First Busey Trust & Investment
Co., organized in January, 1987, which is exclusively dedicated to providing a
full range of trust and investment management services, including farm
management, estate and financial planning, tax preparation, custody services and
philanthropic advisory services; (2) First Busey Securities, Inc., organized in
April, 1991, which is a full service broker/dealer and provides individual
investment advice; and (3) Busey Insurance Services, Inc., organized in October,
1997, which offers a variety of insurance products.

     First Busey Resources, Inc., located in Urbana, Illinois, owns and manages
Busey Plaza, a professional office building that is fully leased to unaffiliated
tenants.

     First Busey Capital Trust I ("Capital Trust I"), a statutory business trust
organized under the Delaware Business Trust Act, was formed in June, 2001.
First Busey owns all of the Common Securities of Capital Trust I.  First Busey
and Capital Trust I jointly filed a registration statement reflecting the
registration of $22 million of 9.00% Cumulative Trust Preferred Securities
issued by Capital Trust I and guaranteed by First Busey.  The entire $22 million
issue, as well as a $3 million over-allotment, were sold in June, 2001.


                                        4

COMPETITION
     The Banks compete actively with national and state banks, savings and loan
associations and credit unions for deposits and loans primarily in central and
east-central Illinois, southwest Florida, and central Indiana.  In addition,
First Busey and its non-bank subsidiaries compete with other financial
institutions, including asset management and trust companies, security
broker/dealers, personal loan companies, insurance companies, finance companies,
leasing companies, mortgage companies and certain governmental agencies, all of
which actively engage in marketing various types of loans, deposit accounts and
other products and services.

     Based on information obtained from FDIC/OTS Summary of Deposits dated June,
2001, First Busey ranked first in total deposits in the combined markets of
Champaign, McLean and Ford Counties.  Customers for banking services are
generally influenced by convenience, quality of service, personal contacts,
price of services and availability of products.  Although the market share of
First Busey varies in different markets, First Busey believes that its
affiliates effectively compete with other banks, thrifts and financial
institutions in their relevant market areas.

     SUPERVISION, REGULATION AND OTHER FACTORS

GENERAL
     First Busey is a financial holding company subject to supervision and
regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal
Reserve") under the Bank Holding Company Act ("BHCA"), and by the Illinois Bank
Holding Company Act ("IBHCA").  First Busey's state-chartered bank is subject to
regulation and examination primarily by the State of Illinois Office of Banks
and Real Estate ("SIOBRE") and, secondarily, by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ("FDIC"). First Busey's federally chartered capital stock savings
association is subject to regulation and examination primarily by the Office of
Thrift Supervision ("OTS") and, secondarily, by the FDIC.  Numerous other
federal and state laws, as well as regulations promulgated by the Federal
Reserve, SIOBRE, FDIC and OTS govern almost all aspects of the operations of the
Banks.  Various federal and state bodies regulate and supervise First Busey's
non-banking subsidiaries including its brokerage, investment advisory and
insurance agency operations.  These include, but are not limited to, SIOBRE,
Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission, National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc., Illinois Department of Insurance, federal and state
banking regulators and various state regulators of insurance and brokerage
activities.

RECENT LEGISLATION
     On November 12, 1999, former President Clinton signed into law legislation
that allows bank holding companies to engage in a wider range of non-banking
activities, including greater authority to engage in securities and insurance
activities.  Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the "Act"), a bank holding
company that elects to become a financial holding company may engage in any
activity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the
Treasury, determines by regulation or order is: (1) financial in nature; (2)
incidental to any such financial activity; or (3) complementary to any such
financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or
soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally.  This
Act makes significant changes in U.S. banking law, principally by repealing
certain restrictive provisions of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act.  The Act
specifies certain activities that are deemed to be financial in nature,
including lending, exchanging, transferring, investing for others, or
safeguarding money or securities; underwriting and selling insurance; providing
financial, investment, or economic advisory services; underwriting, dealing in
or making a market in, securities; and any activity currently permitted for bank
holding companies by the Federal Reserve under Section 4(c)(8) of the BHCA.  The
Act does not authorize banks or their affiliates to engage in commercial
activities that are not financial in nature.  A bank holding company may elect
to be treated as a financial holding company only if all depository institution
subsidiaries of the holding company are well-capitalized, well-managed and have
at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act.  First
Busey became a financial holding company in May, 2000.


                                        5

<PAGE>
     In addition to the Act, there have been a number of legislative and
regulatory proposals that would have an impact on bank/financial holding
companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries.  It is impossible to predict
whether or in what form these proposals may be adopted in the future and if
adopted, what their effect will be on First Busey.

DIVIDENDS
     The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash
dividends by financial holding companies. In the policy statement, the Federal
Reserve expressed its view that a bank holding company experiencing weak
earnings should not pay cash dividends in excess of its net income or which
could only be funded in ways that would weaken its financial health, such as by
borrowing. First Busey is also subject to certain contractual and regulatory
capital restrictions that limit the amount of cash dividends that First Busey
may pay.  The Federal Reserve also may impose limitations on the payment of
dividends as a condition to its approval of certain applications, including
applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions.

     The primary sources of funds for First Busey's payment of dividends to its
shareholders are dividends and fees to First Busey from its banking and
nonbanking affiliates.  Various federal and state statutory provisions and
regulations limit the amount of dividends that the subsidiary banks of First
Busey may pay.  Under provisions of the Illinois Banking Act ("IBA"), dividends
may not be declared by banking subsidiaries except out of the bank's net profit
(as defined), and unless the bank has transferred to surplus at least one-tenth
of its net profits since the date of the declaration of the last preceding
dividend, until the amount of its surplus is at least equal to its capital.

     Federal and state banking regulations applicable to First Busey and its
banking subsidiaries require minimum levels of capital, which limit the amounts
available for payment of dividends.

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
     First Busey is required to comply with the capital adequacy standards
established by the Federal Reserve, and its banking subsidiaries must comply
with similar capital adequacy standards established by the OTS, FDIC, and
SIOBRE, as applicable. There are two basic measures of capital adequacy for
financial holding companies and their banking subsidiaries that have been
promulgated by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC: a risk-based measure and a
leverage measure. All applicable capital standards must be satisfied for a bank
holding company or a bank to be considered in compliance.

     Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of
enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination
of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on the taking of brokered
deposits, and certain other restrictions on its business. As described below,
substantial additional restrictions can be imposed upon FDIC insured depository
institutions that fail to meet applicable capital requirements. See "Prompt
Corrective Action."

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION
     The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
("FDICIA") establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the
problems of undercapitalized institutions. Under this system the federal banking
regulators are required to rate supervised institutions on the basis of five
capital categories (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized,
significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) and to take
certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other
discretionary actions, with respect to institutions in the three
undercapitalized categories, the severity of which will depend upon the capital
category in which the institution is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow
exception, FDICIA requires the banking regulator to appoint a receiver or
conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. The federal
banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for
each category.

     Pursuant to FDICIA, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OTS have adopted
regulations setting forth a five-tier scheme for measuring the capital adequacy
of the financial institutions they supervise. Under the regulations, an
institution would be placed in one of the following capital categories: (i) well


                                        6

<PAGE>
capitalized (an institution that has a Total Capital ratio of at least 10%, a
Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6% and a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5%);
(ii) adequately capitalized (an institution that has a Total Capital ratio of at
least 8%, a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 4% and a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of a
least 4%); (iii) undercapitalized (an institution that has a Total Capital ratio
of under 8%, a Tier 1 Capital ratio of under 4% or a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of
under 4%); (iv) significantly undercapitalized (an institution that has a Total
Capital ratio of under 6%, a Tier 1 Capital ratio of under 3% or a Tier 1
Leverage Ratio of under 3%); and (v) critically undercapitalized (an institution
whose tangible equity is not greater than 2% of total tangible assets). The
regulations permit the appropriate federal banking regulator to downgrade an
institution to the next lower category if the regulator determines (i) after
notice and opportunity for hearing or response, that the institution is in an
unsafe or unsound condition or (ii) that the institution has received (and not
corrected) a less-than-satisfactory rating for any of the categories of asset
quality, management, earnings or liquidity in its most recent examination.
Supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator depend upon an
institution's classification within the five categories. First Busey's
management believes that First Busey and its significant bank subsidiaries have
the requisite capital levels to qualify as well capitalized institutions under
the FDICIA regulations.

     FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital
distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to
its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be
undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to
restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition,
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and
are required to submit capital restoration plans. A depository institution's
holding company must guarantee the capital plan, up to an amount equal to the
lesser of 5% of the depository institution's assets at the time it becomes
undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution
fails to comply with the plan. Federal banking agencies may not accept a capital
plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on
realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository
institution's capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable
plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized.

     Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a
number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient
voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total
assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a
receiver or conservator.

498 employees (full-time equivalents).

OF OPERATIONS

     The following is management's discussion and analysis of the financial
condition and results of operations of First Busey Corporation and Subsidiaries
(the "Corporation") for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999.  It
should be read in conjunction with "Business," "Selected Financial Data," the
consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated
financial statements and other data included in this Annual Report.

     The Corporation's consolidated income is generated primarily by the
financial services activities of its subsidiaries.  Since January 1, 1982, the
Corporation has acquired eleven banks and sold two; acquired six savings and
loan branches and two bank branches; acquired a bank branch in an FDIC assisted
acquisition of a failed bank; acquired a thrift holding company and federal

income from Bank subsidiaries and includes deduction for amortization expense
recorded on parent company statements).

     Busey Bank, Busey Bank Florida and First Busey Trust & Investment Co. are
the three subsidiaries which have each contributed 10% of the Corporation's
consolidated net income.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001

SUMMARY
     The Corporation reported net income of $15,653,000 in 2001, up 11.4% from
$14,053,000 in 2000, which had increased 12.0% from $12,548,000 in 1999.
Diluted earnings per share in 2001 increased 11.7% to $1.15 from $1.03 in 2000,
which was a 14.4% increase from $.90 in 1999.  The main factors contributing to
the increase in net income in 2001 were increases in net interest income,
service charges on deposit accounts, and gains on the sale of pooled mortgage
loans.  Operating earnings, which exclude security gains and the related tax
expense, were $14,878,000 or $1.09 per share for 2001; $13,608,000, or $1.00 per
share for 2000; and $11,924,000, or $.86 per share for 1999.

     Security gains after the related tax expense were $775,000 or 5.0% of net
income in 2001; $445,000 or 3.2% of net income in 2000; and $624,000 or 5.0% of
net income in 1999.  First Busey Corporation owns a position in a qualified
equity security with substantial appreciated value. First Busey's Board
authorized an orderly liquidation of this asset over a ten-year period.

     The Corporation's return on average assets was 1.19%, 1.12% and 1.22% for
2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively, and return on average equity was 15.80%,
16.56%, and 14.68% for 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.  On an operating
earnings basis, return on average assets was 1.13%, 1.08%, and 1.16% for 2001,
2000, and 1999, respectively, and return on average equity was 15.02%, 16.03%
and 13.95% for 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

NET INTEREST INCOME
     Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased 1.8% in 2001 to
$44,883,000 in 2000, which reflected a 14.0% increase from $38,668,000 in 1999.
The decrease in interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve Bank throughout
2001 led to declines in the amount of income earned on interest-earning assets
as well as the amount of expense recognized on interest-bearing liabilities.
The falling rate environment had greater impact on the yields earned on
interest-earning assets, particularly in the average balance of loans
outstanding, more than offset the decline due to the falling rate environment
and led to the increase in net interest income.

     Average interest-earning assets increased to $1,232,889,000 in 2001 from
$1,179,245,000 and $963,641,000 in 2000 and 1999.  The net interest margin,
expressed as a percentage of interest-earning assets, was 3.64% in 2001, 3.74%
in 2000, and 4.02% in 1999.  The yield on interest-earning assets dropped from
8.03% in 2000 to 7.41% in 2001.  Similarly, the rate paid on interest-bearing
liabilities fell from 4.77% in 2000 to 4.28% in 2001.  Interest rates increase
during 2000 and led to increased in both the yield earned on interest-earning
assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities as compared to 1999.

PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES
     The provision for loan losses, which is a current charge against income,
represents an amount which management believes is sufficient to maintain an
adequate allowance for known and probable losses.  In assessing the adequacy of
the allowance for loan losses, management considers the size and quality of the
loan portfolio measured against prevailing economic conditions, regulatory
guidelines, and historical loan loss experience, credit quality of the
portfolio, prevailing economic conditions, and regulatory guidelines.  When a
determination is made by management to charge off a loan balance, such write-off
is charged against the allowance for loan losses.

     The provision for loan losses decreased $495,000 to $2,020,000 in 2001 from
$2,515,000 in 2000 which had decreased from $2,570,000 in 1999.  The decrease in
2001 is due primarily to management's assessment of improved credit quality
within the loan portfolio.  Net charge-offs decreased to $600,000 in 2001 from
$650,000 in 2000, and total non-performing loans decreased to $2,224,000 as of
December 31, 2001, compared to $5,434,000 as of December 31, 2000.  Net
charge-offs were $369,000 in 1999, and non-performing loans totaled $2,117,000
as of December 31, 1999.


                                       12

<PAGE>
     Sensitive assets include nonaccrual loans, loans on First Busey
Corporation's watch loan report, and other loans identified as having more than
reasonable potential for loss.  The watch loan list is comprised of loans which
have been restructured or involve customers in industries which have been
adversely affected by market conditions.  The majority of these loans are being
repaid in conformance with their contracts.

OTHER INCOME
     Other income increased 17.3% in 2001 to $21,460,000 from $18,288,000 in
2000, which reflected a 12.9% increase from $16,192,000 in 1999.  The increases
in 2001 and 2000 are due primarily to increases in service charges on deposit
accounts, trust fee income, commissions and brokers' fees, and gains on the sale
of loans.  As a percentage of total income, other income was 19.3%, 16.4%, and
18.3% in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.  Gains on the sale of securities,
as a component of other income, totaled $1,285,000 (6.0%) in 2001, $737,000
(4.0%) in 2000, and $1,035,000 (6.4%) in 1999.  Other income also includes gains
on sales of loans, as a component of other income, of $2,296,000 (10.7%),
$1,112,000 (6.1%), and $895,000 (5.5%) in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

     Additional components of other income were fee income and trust fees.
Service charges and other fee income increased 6.8% to $9,950,000 in 2001 from
$9,317,000 in 2000, which was a 23.0% increase from $7,572,000 in 1999.  The
growth in fee income in 2001 and 2000 is due primarily to increases in service
charges on deposit accounts. Despite the poor equity market in 2001, trust fees
increased 5.6% in 2001.  Trust revenues were $4,607,000 in 2001, $4,364,000 in
2000, and $4,013,000 in 1999.  Increases in trust department revenues in each
year were primarily due to increases in assets under care to $1,178,483,000 at
December 31, 2001, from $1,066,723,000 at December 31, 2000, which is an
increase from $971,554,000 from December 31, 1999.  Remaining other income
increased 20.5% to $3,322,000 in 2001 from $2,758,000 in 2000 which was a 3.0%
increase from $2,677,000 in 1999.

OTHER EXPENSES
     Other expenses increased 4.6% in 2001 to $38,974,000 from $37,249,000 in
2000, which reflected an increase from $33,063,000 in 1999.  As a percentage of
total income, other expenses were 35.0%, 33.4%, and 37.4% in 2001, 2000, and
1999, respectively.  Employee related expenses, including salaries and wages and
employee benefits, increased 10.4% in 2001 to $21,066,000, as compared to
$19,080,000 in 2000, which was a 8.6% increase from $17,565,000 in 1999.  As a
percent of average assets, employee related expenses were 1.61%, 1.51%, and
1.70% in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.  The Corporation had 498, 484, and
494 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively.  Net occupancy expense of bank premises and furniture and
equipment expenses increased 3.4% in 2001 to $6,957,000 as compared to
$6,729,000 in 2000 and $6,010,000 in 1999.

     Remaining other expenses decreased $489,000 or 4.3% to $10,951,000 in 2001
from $11,440,000 in 2000, which was a 20.6% increase from $9,488,000 in 1999.
Data processing expenses fell to $799,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001,
compared to $1,142,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, and $838,000 for
the year ended December 31, 1999.  Data processing expenses were higher in 2000
due to one-time conversion and setup expenses.  Amortization and impairment
expenses also declined in 2001 as compared to 2000.  During the year ended
December 31, 2001, the Corporation recognized an impairment write-down of
$325,000 on a customer list purchased by First Busey Securities, Inc.  Revenues
generated from this customer list were lower than originally projected.  During
the year ended December 31, 2000, the Corporation recognized an impairment
write-down of $600,000 on the core deposit intangible associated with the
acquisition of First Federal.

INCOME TAXES
     Income tax expense in 2001 was $8,363,000 as compared to $7,237,000 in 2000
and $5,402,000 in 1999.  The provision for income taxes as a percent of income
before income taxes was 34.8%, 34.0%, and 30.1%, for 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively.

BALANCE SHEET-DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND DECEMBER 31, 2000

     Total assets on December 31, 2001 were $1,300,689,000, a decrease of 4.0%
from $1,355,044,000 on December 31, 2000. Total loans, net of unearned interest,
decreased 0.6% to $978,106,000 on December 31, 2001, as compared to $984,369,000
on December 31, 2000.  Total deposits decreased 3.7% to $1,105,999,000 on
December 31, 2001 as compared to $1,148,787,000 on December 31, 2000.
Non-interest bearing deposits increased $4,016,000 or 3.0% during 2001.
Interest-bearing deposits decreased $46,804,000 or 4.6% during 2001.

     Total stockholders' equity increased 14.6% to $105,790,000 on December 31,
2001, as compared to $92,325,000 on December 31, 2000.  Growth in equity is due
primarily to $8,646,000 earnings retained in the Corporation combined with net
increases of $2,211,000 in unrealized gains on available for sale securities and
a $3,219,000 decrease in Treasury stock.  Treasury shares will be reissued in
future years as participants exercise outstanding options under the
Corporation's stock option plan which is discussed in Note 15 to the
Corporation's consolidated financial statements.

A.  EARNING ASSETS

     The average interest-earning assets of the Corporation were 94.0%, 93.2%,
and 93.4%, of average total assets for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000,
and 1999, respectively.

B.  INVESTMENT SECURITIES

     The Corporation has classified all investment securities as securities
available for sale.  These securities are held with the option of their disposal
in the foreseeable future to meet investment objectives or for other operational
needs.  Securities available for sale are carried at fair value.  As of December
31, 2001, the fair value of these securities was $210,869,000 and the amortized
cost was $197,398,000.  There were $13,653,000 of gross unrealized gains and
$182,000 of gross unrealized losses for a net unrealized gain of $13,471,000.
The after-tax effect ($8,128,000) of this unrealized gain has been included in
stockholders' equity.  The increase in market value for the debt securities in
this classification was a result of declining interest rates.  The fair value
increase in the equity securities was primarily due to a $587,000 increase in
the value of 100,000 shares of USA Ed Inc. (SLM) common stock owned by the
Corporation.

The composition of securities available for sale is as follows:

</TABLE>

     The securities held to maturity portfolio consisted of debt securities
which provided the Corporation with a relatively stable source of income.
Additionally, the investment portfolio provides a balance to interest rate and
credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle
for the investment of available funds and supplying securities to pledge as
required collateral for certain deposits.  All remaining securities were
transferred to the available for sale portfolio as of December 31, 1997.

     The Corporation also uses its investment portfolio to manage its tax
position.  Depending upon projected levels of taxable income for the
Corporation, periodic changes are made in the mix of tax-exempt and taxable
securities to achieve maximum yields on a tax-equivalent basis.  U.S. government
and agency securities as a percentage of total securities decreased to 68.0% at
December 31, 2001 from 71.3% at December 31, 2000 while obligations of state and
political subdivisions (tax-exempt obligations) as a percentage of total
securities increased to 20.8% at December 31, 2001, from 18.9% at December 31,
2000.

LOAN PORTFOLIO
     Loans, including loans held for sale, before allowance for loan losses,
decreased 0.6% to $978,106,000 in 2001 from $984,369,000 in 2000.  Non-farm
non-residential real estate mortgage loans increased $22,702,000, or 9.8%, to
$253,932,000 in 2001 from $231,230,000 in 2000.  This increase reflects
management's emphasis on commercial loans secured by mortgages.  Also, 1 to 4
family residential real estate mortgage loans (not held for sale) decreased
$49,464,000, or 12.4%, to $349,270,000 in 2001 from $398,734,000 in 2000.  In
2001's low interest rate environment, the Corporation experienced significant
refinance activity.  The Corporation has no loans to customers engaged in oil
and gas exploration or to foreign companies or governments.  Commitments under
standby letters of credit, unused lines of credit and other conditionally
approved credit lines, totaled approximately $239,287,000 as of December 31,
2001.

     The loan portfolio includes a concentration of loans for commercial real
estate amounting to approximately $308,197,000 and $293,184,000 as of December
31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Generally, these loans are collateralized by
assets of the borrowers.  The loans are expected to be repaid from cash flows or
from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers.  Credit losses
arising from lending transactions for commercial real estate entities are
comparable with the Corporation's credit loss experience on its loan portfolio
as a whole.

</TABLE>

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES
     Management has established an allowance for loan losses which reduces the
total loans outstanding by an estimate of uncollectible loans.  Loans deemed
uncollectible are charged against and reduce the allowance.  Periodically, a
provision for loan losses is charged to current expense.  This provision acts to
replenish the allowance for loan losses and to maintain the allowance at a level
that management deems adequate.

     There is no precise method of predicting specific loan losses or amounts
which ultimately may be charged off on segments of the loan portfolio.  The
determination that a loan may become uncollectible, in whole or in part, is a
matter of judgment.  Similarly, the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses
can be determined only on a judgmental basis, after full review, including (a)
consideration of economic conditions and their effect on particular industries
and specific borrowers; (b) a review of borrowers' financial data, together with
industry data, the competitive situation, the borrowers' management capabilities
and other factors; (c) a continuing evaluation of the loan portfolio, including
monitoring by lending officers and staff credit personnel of all loans which are
identified as being of less than acceptable quality; (d) an in-depth appraisal,
on a monthly basis, of all loans judged to present a possibility of loss (if, as
a result of such monthly appraisals, the loan is judged to be not fully
collectible, the carrying value of the loan is reduced to that portion
considered collectible); and (e) an evaluation of the underlying collateral for
secured lending, including the use of independent appraisals of real estate
properties securing loans.

     Periodic provisions for loan losses are determined by management based upon
the size and the quality of the loan portfolio measured against prevailing
economic conditions and historical loan loss experience and also based on
specific exposures in the portfolio.  Management has instituted a formal loan
review system supported by an effective credit analysis and control process.
The Corporation will maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level
sufficient to absorb estimated uncollectible loans and, therefore, expects to
make periodic additions to the allowance for loan losses.

</TABLE>

     This table indicates growth in the allowance for loan losses for real
estate mortgages as of December 31, 2001 as compared to December 31, 2000.  The
increase in the allowance allocated to real estate mortgages is due primarily to
two factors.  The first factor contributing to this increase is the growth in
non-accrual loans on which higher risk factors have been applied.  The second
factor contributing to this increase is the growth in the total of higher risk
non-farm nonresidental mortgages relative to the balance of total real estate
mortgage balances.

NON-PERFORMING LOANS
     It is management's policy to place commercial and mortgage loans on
non-accrual status when interest or principal is 90 days or more past due.  Such
loans may continue on accrual status only if they are both well-secured and in
the process of collection.

</TABLE>

     On January 1, 1995, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan," as amended by Statement No. 118, which requires loans to be considered
impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable the
Corporation will not be able to collect all amounts due.  The accrual of
interest income on impaired loans is discontinued when there is reasonable doubt
as to the borrower's ability to meet contractual payments of interest or
principal.  Interest income on these loans is recognized to the extent interest
payments are received and the principal is considered fully collectible.  For
the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, no interest was recognized
from impaired loans.

     The gross interest income that would have been recorded in the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 if the non-accrual and restructured loans had
been current in accordance with their original terms was $84,000, $41,000, and
$31,000, respectively.  The amount of interest collected on those loans that was
included in interest income was $17,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001,
$2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, and $0 for the year ended December
31, 1999.

POTENTIAL PROBLEM LOANS
     Potential problem loans are those loans which are not categorized as
impaired, non-accrual, past due or restructured, but where current information
indicates that the borrower may not be able to comply with present loan
repayment terms.  Management assesses the potential for loss on such loans as it
would with other problem loans and has considered the effect of any potential
loss in determining its provision for possible loan losses.  Potential problem
loans totaled $889,000 at December 31, 2001. There are no other loans identified
which management believes represent or result from trends or uncertainties which
management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results,
liquidity or capital resources.  There are no other credits identified about
which management is aware of any information which causes management to have
serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower(s) to comply with the loan
repayment terms.

OTHER INTEREST-BEARING ASSETS
     There are no other interest-bearing assets which are categorized as
impaired.

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS
     The following table sets forth the distribution of short-term borrowings
and weighted average interest rates thereon at the end of each of the last three
years.  Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to
repurchase generally represent overnight borrowing transactions.  Other
short-term borrowings consist of various demand notes and notes with maturities
of less than one year.

LIQUIDITY
     Liquidity is the availability of funds to meet all present and future cash
flow obligations arising in the daily operations of the business at a minimal
cost.  These financial obligations consist of needs for funds to meet extensions
of credit, deposit withdrawals and debt servicing.

     The sources of short-term liquidity utilized by the Corporation consist of
asset maturities, sales, deposits and capital funds.  Additional liquidity is
provided by bank lines of credit, repurchase agreements and the ability to
borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank. The Corporation
does not deal in or use brokered deposits as a source of liquidity.  Long-term
liquidity needs will be satisfied primarily through retention of capital funds.
An additional source of liquidity that can be managed for short-term and
long-term needs is the Corporation's ability to securitize or package loans
(primarily mortgage loans) for sale.

     The objective of liquidity management by the Corporation is to ensure that
funds will be available to meet demand in a timely and efficient manner.  Based
upon the level of investment securities that reprice within 30 days and 90 days,
management currently believes that adequate liquidity exists to meet all
projected cash flow obligations.



                                       20

<PAGE>
     The Corporation achieves a satisfactory degree of liquidity through
actively managing both assets and liabilities.  Asset management guides the
proportion of liquid assets to total assets, while liability management monitors
future funding requirements and prices liabilities accordingly.  Average liquid
assets are shown in the table below:

COMPANY OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES
     In June, 2001, First Busey Capital Trust I, a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Corporation, issued $25,000,000 in cumulative trust preferred securities.
The obligations of the trust are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a
subordinated basis, by the Corporation.  The trust preferred securities are
mandatorily redeemable upon maturity and are callable beginning June 18, 2006.
Proceeds from these trust preferred securities were used to reduce the
Corporation's short-term debt associated with the acquisition of Eagle BancGroup
and First Federal Savings & Loan Association.

RATE SENSITIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
     Interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the volatility of the net
interest margin as a consequence of changes in market rates.  The
rate-sensitivity chart shows the interval of time in which given volumes of
rate-sensitive earning assets and rate-sensitive interest bearing liabilities
would be responsive to changes in market interest rates based on their
contractual maturities or terms for repricing.  It is however, only a static,
single-day depiction of the Corporation's rate sensitivity structure, which can
be adjusted in response to changes in forecasted interest rates.

The following table sets forth the static rate-sensitivity analysis of the
Corporation as of December 31, 2001:

<PAGE>
     The foregoing table shows a negative (liability sensitive) cumulative
unadjusted gap of approximately $212 million in the 1-30 day repricing category.
The gap report indicates that the cumulative gap is negative through one year.
Beyond 90 days, the gap becomes asset sensitive as there are more rate sensitive
assets than rate-sensitive liabilities repricing after 90 days.  The composition
of the gap structure at December 31, 2001 will benefit the Corporation more if
interest rates increase during the next year by allowing the net interest margin
to grow as asset rates would reprice more quickly than rates on rate-sensitive
assets.

CAPITAL RESOURCES
     Other than from the issuance of common stock, the Corporation's primary
source of capital is net income retained by the Corporation.  During the year
ended December 31, 2001, the Corporation earned $15,653,000 and paid dividends
of $7,007,000 to stockholders, resulting in a retention of current earnings of
$8,646,000.

     The Federal Reserve Board uses capital adequacy guidelines in its
examination and regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks.
Risk-based capital ratios are established by allocating assets and certain
off-balance sheet commitments into four risk-weighted categories.  These
balances are then multiplied by the factor appropriate for that risk-weighted
category.  The guidelines require bank holding companies and their subsidiary
banks to maintain a total capital to total risk-weighted asset ratio of not less
than 8.00%, of which at least one half must be Tier 1 capital, and a Tier 1
leverage ratio of not less than 4.00%.  As of December 31, 2001, the Corporation
had a total capital to total risk-weighted asset ratio of 13.63%, a Tier 1
capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of 11.93% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of
8.78%; the Corporation's bank subsidiary, Busey Bank, had ratios of 11.14%,
9.47%, and 7.62%, respectively; the Corporation's thrift subsidiary, Busey Bank
Florida, had ratios of 41.50%, 40.25%, and 7.34%, respectively.  As these ratios
indicate, the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries exceed the regulatory
capital guidelines.

REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS
     It is management's belief that there are no current recommendations by the
regulatory authorities which if implemented, would have a material effect on the
Corporation's liquidity, capital resources, or operations.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
     Accounting for Business Combinations  In June, 2001, Statement on Financial
     ------------------------------------
Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations," was issued to address
financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes APB
Opinion No. 16 and Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 38.
Statement No. 141 requires all business combinations in the scope of this
statement to be accounted for using the purchase method.  Statement No. 141 is
effective for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and all
business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the
acquisition date is July 1, 2001 or later.

     Accounting for Goodwill and Other Assets  Statement of Financial Accounting
     ----------------------------------------
Standard No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," was issued in June,
2001, by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.  The standard addresses
financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible
assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets."  It addresses how
intangible assets should be accounted for at acquisition and in subsequent
periods.  Most significantly, goodwill and intangible assets that have
indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least
annually for impairment.  Intangible assets that have finite useful lives will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives.  The Standard also provides
specific guidance for testing goodwill for impairment and requires additional
disclosures about goodwill and intangible assets.

     The Standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001.  The Standard is required to be applied to the beginning of an entity's
fiscal year and to be applied to all goodwill and other intangible assets
recognized in its financial statements at that date.  Impairment losses for
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that arise due to the initial
application of this Standard are to be reported as resulting from a change in
accounting principle.  The Corporation will apply Statement No. 142 beginning in
the first quarter of 2002.  Application of the nonamortization provisions of


                                       22

<PAGE>
Statement No. 142 is expected to result in an increase in net income of $933,000
($.07 per share) per year.  During 2002 the Corporation will perform the first
of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived  intangible
assets, but has not yet determined what effect those tests will have on the
earnings and financial position of the Corporation.

     Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations  In June, 2001, Statement on
     -------------------------------------------
Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations," was issued to address financial reporting and obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated
asset retirement costs.  This Statement applies to all entities and to legal
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from
the acquisition, construction, development or normal operations of a long-lived
asset, except for certain obligations of lessees.  Statement No. 143 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June
15, 2002.  The Corporation does not believe the adoption of the Standard will
have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

     Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets  In August
     --------------------------------------------------------------
2001, Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," was issued to supersede Statement
No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of," and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30,
"Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions."  Statement No. 144 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, with early application encouraged.
The Corporation does not believe the adoption of the Standard will have a
material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

     The effect of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly
from the effect on an industrial company.  While a financial institution's
operating expenses, particularly salary and employee benefits, are affected by
general inflation, the asset and liability structure of a financial institution
consists largely of monetary items.  Monetary items, such as cash, loans and
deposits, are those assets and liabilities which are or will be converted into a
fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in prices.  As a result, changes
in interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's
performance than does general inflation.  For additional information regarding
interest rates and changes in net interest income see "Selected Statistical
Information."

intentions expressed in such forward looking statements.

     These risks, uncertainties and other factors include the general state of
the economy, both on a local and national level, the ability of First Busey to
successfully complete acquisitions, the continued growth in the geographic area
in which the banking subsidiaries operate, and the retention of individuals who
currently are very important in the management structure of First Busey.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     Market risk is the risk of change in asset values due to movements in
underlying market rates and prices.  Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings
and capital arising from movements in interest rates.  Interest rate risk is the
most significant market risk affecting the Corporation as other types of market
risk, such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk, do
not arise in the normal course of the Corporation's business activities.

     The Corporation's subsidiary banks, Busey Bank and Busey Bank fsb, have
asset-liability committees which meet at least quarterly to review current
market conditions and attempt to structure the banks' balance sheets to ensure
stable net interest income despite potential changes in interest rates with all
other variables constant.

     The asset-liability committees use gap analysis to identify mismatches in
the dollar value of assets and liabilities subject to repricing within specific
time periods. The Funds Management Policy established by the asset liability
committees and approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors establishes
guidelines for maintaining the ratio of cumulative rate-sensitive assets to
rate-sensitive liabilities within prescribed ranges at certain intervals.  A
summary of the Corporation's gap analysis is summarized on page 21.

     The committees do not rely solely on gap analysis to manage interest-rate
risk as interest rate changes do not impact all categories of assets and
liabilities equally or simultaneously.  The asset-liability committees
supplement gap analysis with balance sheet and income simulation analysis to
determine the potential impact on net interest income of changes in market
interest rates.  In these simulation models the balance sheet is projected out
over a one-year period and net interest income is calculated under current
market rates, and then assuming permanent instantaneous shifts in the yield
curve of +/- 100 basis points, 175 basis points and + 200 basis points.
Management measure such changes assuming immediate and sustained shifts in the
Federal funds rate of 100 and 200 basis points, both upward and downward, and
the corresponding shifts in other rate indices based on their historical changes
relative to changes in the Federal funds rate.  The model assumes asset and
liability balances remain constant at December 31, 2001 balances.  The model
uses repricing frequency on all variable-rate assets and liabilities.  The model
also uses a historical decay rate on all fixed-rate core deposit balances.
Prepayment speeds on loans have been adjusted up and down to incorporate
expected prepayment in both a rising and declining rate environment.  Utilizing
this measurement concept the interest rate risk of the Corporation, expressed as
a change in net interest income as a percentage of the net income calculated in
the constant base model, due to changes in interest rates at December 31, 2001,
was as follows:

REPORTS ON FORM 8-K
No reports on Form 8-K have been filed for or on behalf of First Busey
Corporation during the last quarter of 2001.  On April 17, 2001, the Corporation
filed a report on Form 8-K dated April 16, 2001, relating to Vision 2010, First
Busey Corporation's strategic plan, which was presented at the Corporation's
annual shareholder meeting held April 16, 2001.

FORM S-8 UNDERTAKING
     For the purposes of complying with the amendments to the rules governing
Form S-8 (effective July 13, 1990) under the Securities Act of 1933, the
undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows, which undertaking shall be
incorporated by reference into the registrant's Registration Statement on Form
S-8 File No. 33-30095.

     Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act
of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for
indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the
registrant of the expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or
controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action,
suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer, or controlling person
in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless
in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether
such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and
will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

                                   SIGNATURES

Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its
behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Urbana,
Illinois on March 16, 2001.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT


TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS
FIRST BUSEY CORPORATION
URBANA, ILLINOIS

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FIRST BUSEY
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FIRST BUSEY
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of business:
-----------------------

First Busey Corporation (the Corporation) is a financial holding company whose
subsidiaries provide a full range of banking services, including security
broker/dealer services and investment management and fiduciary services, to
individual and corporate customers through its locations in Central Illinois,
Indianapolis, Indiana, and Fort Myers, Florida.  The Corporation and
subsidiaries are subject to competition from other financial institutions and
nonfinancial institutions providing financial products and services.  First
Busey Corporation and its subsidiaries are also subject to the regulations of
certain regulatory agencies and undergo periodic examinations by those
regulatory agencies.

The significant accounting and reporting policies for First Busey Corporation
and its subsidiaries follow:

Basis of consolidation
----------------------

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of First Busey
Corporation and its subsidiaries: Busey Bank and its subsidiaries: Busey Travel,
Inc., and BAT, Inc.; Busey Bank Florida; First Busey Resources, Inc.; Busey
Investment Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries: First Busey Trust & Investment
Company, Inc., First Busey Securities, Inc., and Busey Insurance Services, Inc.;
and First Busey Capital Trust I, LP.  All material intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements of First Busey Corporation have been
prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and conform to predominant practice within the banking
industry.

Use of estimates
----------------

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation's management
is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period.  Actual
results could differ from those estimates.  Material estimates which are
particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the
market value of investment securities, the determination of the allowance for
loan losses and valuation of real estate and other properties acquired in
connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of amounts due from borrowers on
loans.

Trust assets
------------

Assets held for customers in a fiduciary or agency capacity, other than trust
cash on deposit at the Corporation's bank subsidiaries, are not assets of the
Corporation and, accordingly, are not included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

Cash flows
----------

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and due from banks include cash on
hand and amounts due from banks.  Cash flows from federal funds purchased and
sold are reported net, since their original maturities are less than three
months.

FIRST BUSEY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Securities
----------

Securities classified as available for sale are those debt securities that the
Corporation intends to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not
necessarily to maturity, and marketable equity securities.  Any decision to sell
a security classified as available for sale would be based on various factors,
including significant movements in interest rates, changes in the maturity mix
of the Corporation's assets and liabilities, liquidity needs, regulatory capital
considerations and other similar factors.  Securities available for sale are
carried at fair value.  The difference between fair value and amortized cost
results in an unrealized gain or loss.  Unrealized gains or losses are reported
as increases or decreases in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of the
related deferred tax effect, as a part of stockholders' equity.  Realized gains
or losses, determined on the basis of the cost of specific securities sold, are
included in earnings.  Where applicable, amortization of premiums and accretion
of discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over
the period to maturity.

Securities purchased with the intent to earn a profit by trading or reselling
them in a short period of time are classified as trading securities and are
carried at fair value.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in
income.  At December 31, 2001 and 2000, there were no securities classified in
this category.

Loans
-----

Loans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the
foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off are stated at the amount of
unpaid principal, reduced by fees and an allowance for loan losses.

Loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs
are deferred and the net amount amortized as an adjustment of the related loan's
yield.  The Corporation is generally amortizing these amounts over the
contractual life.

Interest is accrued daily on the outstanding balances.  For impaired loans,
accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes, after
considering collection efforts and other factors that the borrower's financial
condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful.  Cash collections on
impaired loans are credited to the loan receivable balance, and no interest
income is recognized on those loans until the principal balance has been
collected.

A loan is impaired when it is probable the Corporation will be unable to collect
all contractual principal and interest payments due in accordance with the terms
of the loan agreement.  Impaired loans are measured based on the present value
of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate,
or as a practical expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair
value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  The amount of
impairment, if any, and any subsequent changes are included in the allowance for
loan losses.

FIRST BUSEY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allowance for loan losses
-------------------------

The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses
charged to operating expense.  Loan losses are charged againsed the allowance
when management believes the loans are uncollectible.  Subsequent recoveries, if
any, are credited to the allowance.  The allowance is based upon continuous
credit reviews of the loan portfolio and considers changes in the nature and
volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, loan concentrations,
specific problem loans, current and anticipated economic conditions that may
affect the borrowers' ability to pay, historical loan loss experience and other
factors, which, in management's opinion, deserve current recognition in
estimating loan losses.

In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for
loan losses, and may require the Bank to make additions to the allowance based
on their judgment of collectibility based on information available to them at
the time of their examination.

Loans held for sale
-------------------

Loans held for sale consist of fixed rate mortgage loans conforming to
established guidelines and held for sale to investors and the secondary mortgage
market.  Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or
estimated fair value.

Loan servicing
--------------

The Corporation generally retains the right to service mortgage loans sold to
others.  The cost allocated to the mortgage servicing rights retained has been
recognized as a separate asset and is being amortized in proportion to and over
the period of estimated net servicing income.

Mortgage servicing rights are periodically evaluated for impairment based on the
fair value of those rights.  Fair values are estimated using discounted cash
flows based on current market rates of interest.  For purposes of measuring
impairment, the rights must be stratified by one or more predominant risk
characteristics of the underlying loans.  The Corporation stratifies its
capitalized mortgage servicing rights based on the origination date of the
underlying loans.  The amount of impairment recognized is the amount, if any, by
which the amortized cost of the rights for each stratum exceeds its fair value.

Premises and equipment
----------------------

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets.

Other real estate owned
-----------------------

Other real estate owned (OREO) represents properties acquired through
foreclosure or other proceedings in settlement of loans.  OREO is held for sale
and is recorded at the date of foreclosure at the fair value of the properties
less estimated costs of disposal.  Any write-down to fair value at the time of
transfer to OREO is charged to the allowance for loan losses.  Property is
evaluated regularly to ensure the recorded amount is supported by its current
fair value, and valuation allowances to reduce the carrying amount to fair value
less estimated costs to dispose are recorded as necessary.

<PAGE>
FIRST BUSEY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intangible assets
-----------------

Costs in excess of the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired
consist primarily of goodwill, core deposit intangible and other identifiable
intangible assets.  Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over periods
not to exceed 25 years.  Core deposit and other identifiable intangible assets
are amortized on an accelerated basis over the estimated period benefited up to
10 years.  Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization were approximately
$10,504,000 and $12,255,000 as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Total amortization expense was approximately $1,751,000, $2,288,000 and
$1,166,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment when events or changed
circumstances may affect the underlying basis of the net assets.  Such reviews
include an analysis of current results and take into consideration the
discounted value of projected operating cash flows.

During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Corporation recognized an
impairment write down of $600,000 on the core deposit intangible of Busey Bank,
fsb.  The Corporation recognized this write down due to a significant run off of
the core deposit base.  This write down is included in the amortization and
impairment of intangible assets line item on the income statement.

Income taxes
------------

The Corporation and its subsidiaries file consolidated Federal and State income
tax returns with each organization computing its taxes on a separate entity
basis.  The provision for income taxes is based on income as reported in the
financial statements.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that
will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future.  The deferred tax
assets and liabilities are computed based on enacted tax laws and rates
applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect
taxable income.  Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to an amount expected to be realized.  Income tax expense is
the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the
period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain reclassifications have been made to the balances as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2000 to be consistent with the classifications adopted as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Earnings per share
------------------

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income for the year by the
weighted average number of shares outstanding.

Diluted earnings per share are determined by dividing net income for the year by
the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock
equivalents outstanding.  Common stock equivalents assume exercise of stock
options and use of proceeds to purchase treasury stock at the average market
price for the period.

Recent accounting pronouncements
--------------------------------

Accounting for Business Combinations  In June 2001, Statement on Financial
------------------------------------
Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations," was issued to address
financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes APB
Opinion No. 16 and Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 38.
Statement No. 141 requires all business combinations in the scope of this
statement to be accounted for using the purchase method.  Statement No. 141 is
effective for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and all
business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the
acquisition date is July 1, 2001 or later.

Accounting for Goodwill and Other Assets  Statement of Financial Accounting
----------------------------------------
Standard No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," was issued in June
2001 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.  The standard addresses
financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible
assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets."  It addresses how
intangible assets should be accounted for at acquisition and in subsequent
periods.  Most significantly, goodwill and intangible assets that have
indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least
annually for impairment.  Intangible assets that have finite useful lives will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives.  The Standard also provides
specific guidance for testing goodwill for impairment and requires additional
disclosures about goodwill and intangible assets.

The Standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.
The Standard is required to be applied to the beginning of an entity's fiscal
year and to be applied to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in
its financial statements at that date.  Impairment losses for goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets that arise due to the initial application of
this Standard are to be reported as resulting from a change in accounting
principle.  The Corporation will apply Statement No. 142 beginning in the first
quarter of 2002.  Application of the nonamortization provisions of Statement No.
142 is expected to result in an increase in net income of $933,000 ($.07 per
share) per year.  During 2002, the Corporation will perform the first of the
required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets,
but has not yet determined what effect those tests will have on the earnings and
financial position of the Corporation.

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations  In June 2001, Statement on
-------------------------------------------
Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations," was issued to address financial reporting and obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated
asset retirement costs.  This Statement applies to all entities and to legal
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from
the acquisition, construction, development or normal operations of a long-lived
asset, except for certain obligations of lessees.  Statement No. 143 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June
15, 2002.  The Corporation does not believe the adoption of the Standard will
have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets  In August 2001,
--------------------------------------------------------------
Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," was issued to supersede Statement
No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of," and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30,
"Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions."  Statement No. 144 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, with early application encouraged.
The Corporation does not believe the adoption of the Standard will have a
material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Comprehensive income
--------------------

Accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains
and losses be included in net income.  Although certain changes in assets and
liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities, are reported as a separate component of the equity section of the
balance sheet, such items, along with net income, are components of
comprehensive income.


NOTE 2. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

On October 29, 1999, the Corporation acquired all the outstanding common stock
of Eagle BancGroup, Inc. and its subsidiary Busey Bank, fsb, an $184,000,000
thrift located in Bloomington, Illinois.  This acquisition has been accounted
for as a purchase and the results of operations of both entities since the
acquisition date have been included in the consolidated financial statements.
The purchase price of $27,075,000 was allocated based upon the fair value of the
assets acquired.  The excess of the total acquisition cost over the fair value
of the net assets acquired of $8,903,000 is being amortized over periods up to
twenty years using the straight-line method.

NOTE 3. CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS

The Corporation's banking and thrift subsidiaries are required to maintain
certain cash reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, which
may be offset by cash on hand.  The required reserve balances as of December 31,
2001 and 2000 were approximately $8,464,000 and $6,103,000, respectively.

In October 1997, the Corporation's bank subsidiary established a clearing
balance requirement of $2,000,000 with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago to
use Federal Reserve Bank services.  As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the
clearing balance requirement was $2,750,000.  These deposited funds generate
earnings credits at market rates which offset service charges resulting from the
use of Federal Reserve Bank services.  The clearing balance requirement is
included in the required reserve balance referred to above and may be increased,
or otherwise adjusted, on approval of the Federal Reserve Bank based on
estimated service charges; however, such adjustments will be made no more
frequently than once per month.

The Corporation maintains its cash in deposit accounts which, at times, may
exceed federally insured limits.  The Corporation has not experienced any losses
in such accounts.  The Corporation believes it is not exposed to any significant
credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.

</TABLE>

The loan portfolio includes a concentration of loans for commercial real estate
amounting to approximately $308,197,000 and $293,184,000 as of December 31, 2001
and 2000, respectively.  Generally these loans are collateralized by assets of
the borrowers.  The loans are expected to be repaid from cash flows or from
proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers.  Credit losses
arising from lending transactions for commercial real estate entities are
comparable with the Corporation's credit loss experience on its loan portfolio
as a whole.

The Corporation's opinion as to the ultimate collectibility of loans is subject
to estimates regarding future cash flows from operations and the value of
property, real and personal, pledged as collateral.  These estimates are
reflected by changing economic conditions and the economic prospects of
borrowers.

NOTE 15. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Employees' Stock Ownership Plan
-------------------------------

The First Busey Corporation Employees' Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) is available
to all full-time employees who meet certain age and length of service
requirements.  The ESOP purchased common shares of the Corporation using the
proceeds of bank borrowings which is secured by the stock.  The borrowings are
to be repaid using fully deductible contributions to the trust fund.  As the
ESOP makes each payment of principal, an appropriate percentage of stock will be
allocated to eligible employees' accounts in accordance with applicable
regulations under the Internal Revenue Code.  Allocations of common stock
released and forfeitures are based on the eligible compensation of each
participant.  Dividends on allocated shares of common stock are distributed
directly to the participants, and dividends on unallocated shares are used to
service the bank borrowings.  All shares held by the ESOP, which were acquired
prior to the issuance of Statement of Position 93-6, are included in the
computation of average common shares and common share equivalents.  This
accounting treatment is grandfathered under Statement of Position 93-6,
"Employers' Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans" for shares purchased
prior to December 31, 1992.

As permitted by AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) 93-6, compensation expense for
shares released during 1999 is equal to the original acquisition cost of the
shares if they were acquired prior to December 31, 1992.  During the year ended
December 31, 1999, $150,000 of compensation expense was recognized for ESOP
shares acquired prior to December 31, 1992, releasing 44,286 common shares to
participant accounts, and is reflected in the chart below under "Employee

Benefits."  During 1999 no shares were released that were acquired by the ESOP
after December 31, 1992.  During 2000, $337,000 of compensation expense was
recognized for the ESOP, releasing 18,000 shares to participant accounts, and is
reflected in the chart below under "Employee Benefits".  During 2001, $303,000
of compensation expense was recognized for the ESOP, releasing 12,000 shares to
participant accounts and is reflected in the chart below under "Employee
Benefits".  For such shares, compensation expense is equal to the fair market
value of the shares released.  Compensation expense related to the ESOP plan,
including related interest expense, was $459,000, $488,000 and $203,000 in the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999.

The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions.  In addition,
such models require the use of subjective assumptions, including expected stock
price volatility.  In management's opinion, such valuation models may not
necessarily provide the best single measure of option value.

NOTE 17. TRANSACTIONS WITH DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

The Corporation and its subsidiaries have had, and may be expected to have in
the future, banking transactions in the ordinary course of business with
directors, executive officers, their immediate families and affiliated companies
in which they have 10% or more beneficial ownership (commonly referred to as
related parties), on the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as
those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with others.

The following is an analysis of the changes in loans to related parties during
the year ended December 31, 2001:

</TABLE>


NOTE 18. CAPITAL

The ability of the Corporation to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and to
service its debt is dependent on the receipt of cash dividends from its
subsidiaries.  State chartered banks have certain statutory and regulatory
restrictions on the amount of cash dividends they may pay.  As a practical
matter, dividend payments are restricted because of the desire to maintain a
strong capital position in the subsidiaries.

The Corporation and the Banks are subject to various regulatory capital
requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies.  Failure to
meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly
additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have
a direct material effect on the Corporation's or the Banks' financial
statements.  Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for
prompt corrective action, the Corporation and the Banks must meet specific
capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets,
liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory
accounting practices.  The Corporation's and the Banks' capital amounts and
classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about
components, risk weightings, and other factors.  Prompt corrective action
provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies.

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
require the Corporation and the Banks to maintain minimum amounts and ratios
(set forth in the table below) of total and Tier I capital (as defined in the
regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and Tier 1 capital (as
defined) to average assets (as defined).  Management believes, as of December
31, 2001, that the Corporation and the Banks meet all capital adequacy
requirements to which they are subject.

As of December 31, 2001, the most recent notification from the federal and state
regulatory agencies categorized the Banks as well capitalized under the
regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.  To be categorized as well
capitalized, the Banks must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I
risk-based, and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table.  There are no
conditions or events since that notification that management believes have
changed the Banks' categories.

NOTE 19. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND CREDIT RISK

The Corporation and its subsidiaries are parties to legal actions which arise in
the normal course of their business activities.  In the opinion of management,
the ultimate resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material
effect on the financial position or the results of operations of the Corporation
and its subsidiaries.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries are parties to financial instruments with
off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing
needs of its customers.  These financial instruments include commitments to
extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees.  Those
instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate
risk.  The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent
of involvement the Corporation has in particular classes of financial
instruments.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries' exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to
extend credit and standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written is
represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.  The Corporation and
its subsidiaries use the same credit policies in making commitments and
conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

A summary of the contractual amount of the Corporation's exposure to
off-balance-sheet risk follows:

Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent
   credit risk:
      Commitments to extend credit                         $  226,651     $  182,736
      Standby letters of credit                                12,636          2,640
</TABLE>


Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.  These
commitments are generally at variable interest rates and generally have fixed
expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon,
the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements.  The customer's credit worthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case
basis.  The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the
Corporation upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation
of the counterparty.  Collateral held varies but may include accounts
receivable, inventory, property and equipment and income-producing commercial
properties.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Corporation
to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  Those letters of
credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing
arrangements, including bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk
involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved
in extending loan facilities to customers.

As of December 31, 2001, the Corporation has no futures, forwards, swaps or
option contracts, or other financial instruments with similar characteristics.

NOTE 20. DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

Cash and cash equivalents
-------------------------

The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and due from banks
and federal funds sold approximate those assets' fair values.

Securities
----------

For securities available for sale, fair values are based on quoted market prices
or dealer quotes, where available.  If a quoted market price is not available,
fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities.  The
carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates fair value.

Loans
-----

For certain homogeneous categories of loans, such as some residential mortgages,
fair value is estimated using the quoted market prices for similar loans or
securities backed by similar loans, adjusted for differences in loan
characteristics.  The fair value of other types of loans is estimated by
discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans
would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same
remaining maturities.  The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable

Deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase
-----------------------------------------------------------

The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, interest-bearing
transaction accounts, and certain money market deposits is defined as the amount
payable on demand at the reporting date.  The fair value of fixed-maturity
certificates of deposit and securities sold under agreements to repurchase is
estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining
maturities.  The carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates fair
value.

Short-term borrowings and long-term debt
----------------------------------------

Rates currently available to the Corporation for debt with similar terms and
remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing debt.  The
carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates fair value.

COMPANY OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES

Fair values are based upon quoted market prices or dealer quotes.  The carrying
amount of accrued interest payable approximates fair value.

Commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit
----------------------------------------------------------

The fair value of commitments is estimated using the fees currently charged to
enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the
agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties.  For
fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between
current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.  The fair value of
letters of credit is based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or
on the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise settle the obligations with
the counterparties at the reporting date.  As of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
these items are immaterial in nature.

The estimated fair values of the Corporation's financial instruments are as
follows:

                                MANAGEMENT REPORT
                                   BUSEY BANK
                             AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001


FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Management of Busey Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of First Busey Corporation,
is responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of its
published financial statements as of December 31, 2001, and for the year then
ended.  The consolidated financial statements of First Busey Corporation have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and, as such, include some amounts that are based on
judgments and estimates of management.

INTERNAL CONTROLS
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting presented in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the Federal
Financial Institutions Examination Council Instructions for Consolidated Reports
of Condition and Income (call report instructions).  The system contains
monitoring mechanisms and actions are taken to correct deficiencies identified.

There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal
control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or
overriding of controls.  Accordingly, even an effective internal control can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation.  Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of
internal control may vary over time.

Management assessed Busey Bank's internal control over financial reporting
presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and call reports instructions as of December 31, 2001.
This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over
financial reporting described in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework"
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based on this assessment, management believes that Busey Bank maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting presented in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
call reports instructions as of December 31, 2001.

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATION
Management is responsible for compliance with the federal and state laws and
regulations concerning dividend restrictions and federal laws and regulations
concerning loans to insiders designated by the FDIC as safety and soundness laws
and regulations.

Management assessed compliance by Busey Bank with the designated laws and
regulations relating to safety and soundness. Based on our assessment,
management believes Busey Bank complied, in all significant respects, with the
designated laws and regulations related to safety and soundness for the year
ended December 31, 2001.

                         INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT'S REPORT





TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
BUSEY BANK
URBANA, ILLINOIS

We have examined management's assertion that BUSEY BANK, a wholly owned
subsidiary of FIRST BUSEY CORPORATION, maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2001, included in the accompanying
Management Report insofar as management's assertion relates to internal control
over the annual financial reporting in the 2001 consolidated financial
statements of First Busey Corporation and Busey Bank's December 31, 2001 Call
Report.

Our examination was made in accordance with attestation standards established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly,
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of the
internal control, and such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances.  We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

Because of inherent limitations in any internal control, misstatements due to
error or fraud may occur and not be detected.  Also, projections of any
evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting future periods are
subject to the risk that the internal control may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management's assertions that BUSEY BANK maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2001 is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based upon criteria established in "Internal
Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
