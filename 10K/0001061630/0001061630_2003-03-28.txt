-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 1.        Business
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General
-------

Capital Trust, Inc. (the "Company") is an investment  management and real estate
finance company that specializes in providing  structured  capital  solutions to
owner/operators of commercial real estate. In December 2002, the Company's board
of  directors  authorized  an election  to be taxed as a real estate  investment
trust ("REIT") for the 2003 tax year. The Company will continue to make, for its
own account and as investment manager for the account of funds under management,
loans and  debt-related  investments in various types of commercial  real estate
assets and operating companies.

Business and Investment Strategy
--------------------------------

The Company was created to take  advantage of  opportunities  resulting from the
rapid evolution of the real estate capital markets. Since its inception in 1997,
the Company has designed and  developed a fully  integrated  platform to provide
flexible,  value-added  financing  for large single  properties,  multiple-asset
portfolios and real estate operating companies. The Company's current investment
program emphasizes senior and junior mortgage loans,  mezzanine loans secured by
pledges of equity  interests in the property  owners,  subordinated  tranches of
commercial mortgage backed securities  ("CMBS"),  and preferred and other direct
equity  investments.  In general,  the Company's  investments are subordinate to
other third-party senior financing, but senior to the owner/operator's equity in
the property.

The Company is  co-sponsor  and  exclusive  investment  manager of CT  Mezzanine
Partners II LP ("Fund II"), which ultimately raised total equity  commitments of
$845  million.  The  Company's  business  strategy  is to continue to expand its
investment   management   business  by  sponsoring  other  real  estate  related
investment  funds,  and,  following  the  investment  period for Fund II,  other
commercial real estate  mezzanine  investment  funds.  The Company believes that
these funds will generate  additional  investment  management fees and incentive
compensation  tied to the performance of their  portfolios of  investments.  The
Company  continues  to manage its  existing  portfolio  of balance  sheet assets
originated prior to the commencement of its investment  management  business and
is positioned to selectively add to the Company's  balance sheet  investments by
investing    in   a   diverse    array   of   real    estate   and    investment
management/finance-related   assets   and   enterprises,   including   operating
companies.

The Company funds its business  development and investment  activities with cash
flow  generated  from  operations  and with  borrowings  obtained  under  credit
facilities or pursuant to other financing arrangements. The Company believes its
existing sources of funds are adequate to meet its equity commitments to Fund II
and to fund, as necessary,  new balance sheet loan and investment activity.  The
Company continues to explore alternative sources of capital to fund its business
and investment activities,  including, but not limited to, other joint ventures,
strategic alliances and investment management ventures.

REIT Election
-------------

The Company intends to make the necessary election to be taxed as a REIT for the
2003 tax year.  The  Company  will not undergo  any  fundamental  changes in its
business  and will  continue  to make,  for its own  account  and as  investment
manager  for the  account  of funds  under  management,  loans and  debt-related
investments in various types of commercial  real estate and related  assets.  To
the  extent  necessary,  the  Company  will  modify  its  investment  program to
originate or acquire loans and investments to produce a portfolio that meets the
asset and income tests  necessary to maintain the Company's  qualification  as a
REIT. In order to accommodate the Company's REIT status,  the legal structure of
future investment funds sponsored by the Company may be different from the legal
structure of the Company's existing investment funds.

                                       1

One of the  requirements  to qualify as a REIT is the  elimination of all of the
Company's  accumulated "earnings and profits" from all non-REIT qualifying years
in which the Company  operated as a regular  corporation.  The Company  believes
that it  eliminated  all such  earnings and profits by actions taken in December
2002. The Company did so by triggering  losses through the settlement of certain
derivative hedging  instruments,  the disposition of a non-performing  asset and
the write-down of another non-performing asset.

In order to qualify as a REIT,  five or fewer  individuals  may own no more than
50% of the  class A common  stock,  par value  $0.01 per share  ("Class A Common
Stock"),  of the  Company.  As a means  of  facilitating  compliance  with  such
qualification,  stockholders  controlled by John R. Klopp,  the chief  executive
officer  and a director  of the  Company,  Craig M.  Hatkoff,  a director of the
Company,  and trusts for the benefit of the family of Samuel Zell,  the chairman
of the board of directors of the  Company,  each sold 500,000  shares of Class A
Common  Stock to Stichting  Pensioenfonds  ABP in a  transaction  that closed on
February  7, 2003.  Following  this  transaction,  the  Company's  largest  five
individual  stockholders  own in the  aggregate  less than 50% of the  Company's
Class A Common Stock. In connection with this  transaction,  the Company entered
into a registration  rights agreement with Stichting  Pensioenfonds ABP pursuant
to which the Company  agreed to register  for resale the  purchaser's  shares of
Class A Common Stock.

In connection with the intended REIT election,  the Company has consolidated all
of its management activities, including the investment management of Fund II and
future third-party funds and the ongoing management of the Company itself,  into
its wholly owned subsidiary, CT Investment Management Co., LLC ("CTIMCO"), which
will be  operated as a taxable  REIT  subsidiary.  The  financial  position  and
operations  of CTIMCO  will be  consolidated  into the  financial  position  and
operations  of the Company,  but  presented as a separate  segment.  CTIMCO will
serve as the Company's exclusive manager and all of the Company's employees will
be directly  employed by CTIMCO.  Subject to the  supervision  of the  Company's
board of directors,  CTIMCO will be responsible  for the  day-to-day  operations
pursuant  to  a  management   agreement.   The  Company   expects  to  base  the
compensation,  fees,  expense  reimbursements  and other terms of the management
agreement  with CTIMCO upon the terms  contained  in the  management  agreements
between externally  managed publicly traded commercial  mortgage REITs and their
outside  managers.  The Company  believes  that this will  produce a  management
agreement  with terms  comparable to those that could be obtained from unrelated
parties on an arm's  length  basis.  The Company  believes  that this  corporate
organizational structure will provide financial transparency for, and facilitate
the  separate   valuation  of,  the  Company's  two  business  segments  (to  be
established  in 2003),  which should  provide the Company with more  flexibility
should it decide to sell or spin off CTIMCO's investment  management business in
the future. There are no present plans, proposals or understandings with respect
to a sale or spin-off of the management business.

Also in connection  with the Company's  intended REIT election,  the Company and
affiliates of Citigroup Inc.  modified their existing venture  commenced in 2000
under which they  co-sponsor  and invest in a series of  commercial  real estate
mezzanine funds managed by the Company.  In January 2003, the Company  purchased
Citigroup's  75%  interest  in CT  Mezzanine  Partners  I LLC  ("Fund  I") for a
purchase  price of  approximately  $38.4 million  (including  the  assumption of
liabilities).  The Company also purchased from Citigroup stock purchase warrants
exercisable for 8,528,467 shares of Class A Common Stock for a purchase price of
approximately  $2.1 million.  Finally,  the Company and Citigroup have agreed to
amend the terms of the  agreement  governing  their  venture.  Under the amended
agreement,  the Company will earn 100% of the base  management fees derived from
all funds under management and will receive 62 1/2% of the incentive  management
interests in future mezzanine funds  co-sponsored with Citigroup pursuant to the
amended venture agreement.

Developments During Fiscal Year 2002
------------------------------------

During  fiscal  year 2002,  the  Company  continued  to operate  and develop the
investment  management  business.  The Company  continues  to service  loans and
investments  for Fund I, a fund owned during  fiscal year 2002 75% by affiliates
of  Citigroup  and  25% by the  Company,  and to  make  and  service  loans  and
investments  for Fund II.  During  2002,  Fund II  added to its  portfolio  $549
million of loans and  investments.  As of  December  31,  2002,  Fund I held $50
million  of loans in its  portfolio,  Fund II held  $724  million  of loans  and
investments in its portfolio and all loans in both portfolios were performing in
accordance  with  the  terms  of  their  loan  agreements.  The  Company  earned
approximately  $10.1 million of management and advisory fees from its management
of Fund I and Fund II during 2002. On January 1, 2003, the general

                                       2


<PAGE>


partners  of Fund II  (affiliates  of the  Company  and  Citigroup)  voluntarily
reduced the management  fees for the remainder of the  investment  period by 50%
due to a lower than  expected  level of deployment  of the Fund's  capital.  The
Company expects  approximately 40% of Fund II's committed capital to be invested
at the  end of  the  investment  period  on  April  9,  2003,  further  reducing
management fees from Fund II in 2003.

In December 2002, a Fund I loan for $26.0 million,  which was in default and for
which  the  accrual  of  interest  had  been  suspended,  was  written  down and
distributed  pro-rata to the Company and a Citigroup affiliate as the members of
Fund I. Upon  receipt of its  pro-rata  share of the loan with a face  amount of
$6,500,000, the Company disposed of the asset.

The Company's  total asset base  decreased  from $678.8  million at December 31,
2001 to $385.0  million at  December  31,  2002,  primarily  as a result of loan
repayments  and sales of CMBS.  The Company  also sold other  available-for-sale
securities,  which had been purchased to maintain  compliance  with an exemption
from being treated as an investment  company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940-Act") and were no longer needed to maintain compliance. In 2003,
the Company does not expect a significant decrease in total assets as additional
reductions in loans and investments from  satisfactions will require the Company
to purchase or originate additional 1940-Act qualifying assets.

Description of Business
-----------------------

General
-------

The Company is an investment  management  and real estate  finance  company that
originates or acquires,  for its own account and as investment manager for funds
under  management,  loans  and  debt-related  investments  in  various  types of
commercial real estate assets and operating companies. The Company believes that
its  investment  management  business  allows the  Company to access the private
equity  markets as a source of capital to fund its  business  and  provides  the
potential  for  significant  operating  leverage,  allowing  the Company to grow
earnings and to increase  return on equity without simply  incurring  additional
financial  risk. The Company's  current  lending and  investment  activities are
conducted  principally through funds under management,  although when consistent
with its obligations to funds under management,  the Company will invest for its
own balance sheet.

Real Estate Lending and Investment Market
-----------------------------------------

The Company  developed its current  business to take advantage of  opportunities
resulting from the rapid evolution of the real estate capital markets.  The most
significant  structural change is the continuing growth of the securitization of
commercial  mortgage loans,  which results in certain  borrowers being unable or
unwilling to satisfy  inflexible  credit rating agency  guidelines.  The Company
believes  that  these  significant  fundamental  and  structural  changes in the
commercial  real estate  capital  markets are  creating  the need for  mezzanine
investment capital emphasized in the Company's investment program.

Investment Program
------------------

Whether for funds under management or for its own account,  the Company seeks to
generate  returns  from a portfolio  of  leveraged  loans and  investments.  The
Company's  current  investment  program  emphasizes,  but is not limited to, the
following general categories of real estate and finance-related assets:

     o    Mortgage Loans.  The Company  originates or acquires senior and junior
          mortgage loans ("Mortgage Loans") to commercial real estate owners who
          require interim  financing until permanent  financing can be obtained.
          The  Company's  Mortgage  Loans  are  generally  not  intended  to  be
          permanent  in  nature,  but  rather  are  intended  to  be  relatively
          short-term in duration,  with extension options as deemed appropriate,
          and typically require a balloon payment of principal at maturity.  The
          Company may also  originate and fund whole Mortgage Loans in which the
          Company  intends  to sell  the  senior  tranche,  thereby  creating  a
          Mezzanine Loan.

     o    Mezzanine  Loans.  The Company  originates  or acquires  high-yielding
          loans that are  subordinate to first lien mortgage loans on commercial
          real  estate and are  secured  either by a second  lien  mortgage or a
          pledge of the  ownership  interests in the  borrowing  property  owner
          ("Mezzanine  Loans").  Typically,  Mezzanine Loans provide the capital
          representing the level

                                       3


<PAGE>


          between  60% and  90% of  property  value.  Generally,  the  Company's
          Mezzanine Loans have a longer  anticipated  duration than its Mortgage
          Loans,  are not intended to serve as transitional  mortgage  financing
          and can represent  subordinated  investments in real estate  operating
          companies  which  may take  the form of  secured  or  unsecured  debt,
          preferred stock and other hybrid instruments.

     o    Subordinated  Interests.   The  Company  acquires  rated  and  unrated
          investments in public and private subordinated tranches ("Subordinated
          Interests")  of commercial  collateralized  mortgage  obligations  and
          other CMBS. Subordinated Interests represent the junior,  subordinated
          classes of these  securities,  which  typically have below  investment
          grade  ratings  of "BB" or "B" from  the  rating  agencies  or are the
          unrated high-yielding credit support class.

     o    Other  Investments.  The  Company  remains  positioned  to  develop an
          investment   portfolio  of  commercial   real  estate  and  investment
          management/finance-related   assets   meeting  the  Company's   target
          risk/return  profile.  Except  as  limited  by its role as  investment
          manager to funds under  management and by the requirements to maintain
          its  qualification  as a REIT, the Company is not limited in the kinds
          of commercial  real estate and  investment  management/finance-related
          assets in which it can invest on balance sheet and believes that it is
          positioned to expand  opportunistically its business.  The Company may
          pursue  investments  in,  among  other  assets,   construction  loans,
          distressed mortgages,  foreign real estate and finance-related assets,
          operating   companies,   including   investment   managers   and  loan
          origination  and loan servicing  companies,  and fee interests in real
          property (collectively, "Other Investments").

The Company's  current  investment  program  emphasizes  floating rate loans and
investments that generally provide unleveraged investment yields within a target
range of 400 to 800 basis  points  above  LIBOR.  The Company may  originate  or
acquire fixed rate loans and may make  investments with yields that fall outside
of the foregoing  targeted  investment yield range, but otherwise  correspond to
the level of risk perceived by the Company to be associated  with such loans and
investments.  The  Company  has no  predetermined  limitations  or  targets  for
concentration of asset type or geographic  location.  Instead of adhering to any
prescribed limits or targets,  the Company makes  acquisition  decisions through
asset and collateral  analysis,  evaluating  investment  risks on a case-by-case
basis.

Sources of Financing and Use of Leverage
----------------------------------------

The Company seeks to maximize yield through the use of leverage, consistent with
maintaining an acceptable  level of risk,  and therefore  finances the loans and
investments it holds and manages.  The Company  leverages assets through,  among
other things,  borrowings under credit  facilities,  other secured and unsecured
borrowings,  and financing  obtained through  repurchase  obligations.  When the
expected  benefits  outweigh the risks to the Company,  such borrowings may have
recourse  to the  Company  or the  fund  in the  form  of  guarantees  or  other
obligations. If changes in market conditions cause the cost of such financing to
increase  relative to the income that can be derived from  investments made with
the proceeds thereof, the Company may reduce the amount of leverage it utilizes.
Obtaining  the leverage  required to execute the current  business plan requires
the Company to maintain interest coverage ratios and other covenants mandated by
current market underwriting  standards.  Sources of financing currently employed
by the Company include the following:

     o    Credit  Facilities.  The Company has a credit  facility under which it
          can borrow  funds to finance  its  balance  sheet loan and  investment
          assets.  The $100 million  credit  facility  provides the Company with
          adequate liquidity for its short-term needs.

     o    Term Redeemable  Securities Contract. In connection with the Company's
          original  purchase of a CMBS portfolio from a commercial  lender,  the
          Company  obtained  financing for 70% of the purchase  price, or $137.8
          million,  at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 50 basis points pursuant to
          a term redeemable securities contract with an affiliate of the seller.
          Upon maturity of this term redeemable  securities contract in February
          2002,  the  Company  entered  into a new  term  redeemable  securities
          contract  with the  same  counterparty,  which  allows  for a  maximum
          financing of $75 million. The new term redeemable  securities contract
          has a two-year term with an automatic  one-year  amortizing  extension
          option, if not otherwise extended,  and is utilized to finance certain
          loans held by the Company.

                                       4


<PAGE>


     o    Repurchase  Obligations.   At  December  31,  2002,  the  Company  had
          repurchase obligations  outstanding with two counterparties to finance
          the available-for-sale securities and the assets remaining in the CMBS
          portfolio  discussed  above.  The  Company  may enter  into other such
          obligations under which the Company would sell assets to a third party
          with the commitment  that the Company  repurchase such assets from the
          purchaser at a fixed price on an agreed date.  Repurchase  obligations
          may be  characterized  as loans to the Company  from the other  party,
          with underlying  assets  securing them. The repurchase  price reflects
          the purchase  price plus an agreed  market rate of interest,  which is
          generally paid on a monthly basis.

Leverage  creates an  opportunity  for  increased  income,  but at the same time
creates special risks. For example,  leverage magnifies changes in the net worth
of the  Company or the funds that it manages.  Although  the amount owed will be
fixed,  the assets may change in value during the time the debt is  outstanding.
Leverage  creates  interest  expense  that  can  exceed  the  revenues  from the
leveraged  assets. To the extent the rate of return derived from assets acquired
with borrowed funds exceeds the rate of interest  expense  incurred,  net income
will be greater  than if borrowed  funds had not been used.  Conversely,  if the
revenues  from the assets  acquired with  borrowed  funds are not  sufficient to
cover the cost of borrowing,  net income will be less than if borrowed funds had
not been used.

The Company utilizes  leverage to enhance yields for both its own account and as
investment  manager  for the  account of funds  under  management.  The  Company
expects  that future  investment  funds  sponsored  by the Company  will utilize
leverage  to  enhance  yields,  although  the extent to which  leverage  will be
utilized  will depend on the  investment  parameters  of the product  offered to
investors.  At December 31, 2002, the Company's  debt-to-equity  ratio (treating
the Convertible Trust Preferred Securities as a component of equity) was 1.16:1.

Interest Rate Management Techniques
-----------------------------------

The Company has engaged in and will  continue to engage in a variety of interest
rate  management  techniques for the purpose of managing the effective  interest
rate and/or the value of its assets and/or liabilities.  Any such transaction is
subject to risks and may limit the  potential  earnings on loans and real estate
investments.  Such  techniques  include,  but are not limited to,  interest rate
swaps (the  exchange of  fixed-rate  payments and  floating-rate  payments)  and
interest rate caps. The Company employs the use of correlated hedging strategies
to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on its  operations,  including
engaging in interest  rate swaps and interest rate caps to minimize its exposure
to changes in interest rates. The Company has adopted accounting  policies under
which such  derivatives will impact either or both  shareholders'  equity or net
income  depending on the extent to which  components  of interest  rate risk are
hedged.  See  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and
Results of Operations - Adoption of Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards
No. 133."

Competition
-----------

The Company is engaged in a highly  competitive  business.  The Company competes
for loan and  investment  opportunities  with  numerous  public and private real
estate investment vehicles,  including financial  institutions,  mortgage banks,
pension funds,  opportunity funds, REITs and other institutional  investors,  as
well as individuals. Many competitors are significantly larger than the Company,
have well established operating histories and may have access to greater capital
and other resources.  In addition,  the investment management industry is highly
competitive  and  there are  numerous  well-established  competitors  possessing
substantially greater financial,  marketing,  personnel and other resources than
the Company. The Company competes with other investment  management companies in
attracting capital for funds under management.

financing transactions.

Item 7.        Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
               Results of Operations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
-----------

The Company is an investment  management  and real estate  finance  company that
operated  principally  as a balance sheet lender until the  commencement  of its
investment  management  business in March 2000.  The results for the years ended
December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000  reflect  both balance  sheet  lending and the
investment  management  business.  In  December  2002,  the  Company's  board of
directors  authorized  an  election to be taxed as a REIT for the 2003 tax year.
The Company will continue to make, for its own account and as investment manager
for the account of funds under management, loans and debt-related investments in
various types of commercial real estate assets and operating companies.

Prior to July 1997,  the  Company  operated as a REIT,  originating,  acquiring,
operating  and  holding  income-producing  real  property  and  mortgage-related
investments.  The  Company is the  successor  to  Capital  Trust,  a  California
business  trust,  following  consummation of the  reorganization  on January 28,
1999,  pursuant  to which the  predecessor  ultimately  merged with and into the
Company, which thereafter continued as the surviving Maryland corporation with a
capital   structure  that  closely   mirrored  the  capital   structure  of  the
predecessor.  Unless the context otherwise requires,  hereinafter  references to
the business, assets, liabilities,  capital structure, operations and affairs of
the Company include those of the predecessor prior to the reorganization.

On March  8,  2000,  the  Company  entered  into a  venture  with  Citigroup  to
co-sponsor,  commit to invest capital in and manage  high-yield  commercial real
estate  mezzanine  investment  funds.  Pursuant  to the venture  agreement,  the
Company and Citigroup  co-sponsored  Fund I and Fund II, which ultimately raised
total equity  commitments of $845.2  million,  including  equity  commitments of
$49.7 million and $198.9 million from the Company and  Citigroup,  respectively.
The Company  earned $9.6 million of basic  management and advisory fees from its
management of Fund II in 2002. On January 1, 2003, the general  partners of Fund
II (affiliates of the Company and Citigroup)  voluntarily reduced the management
fees for the  remainder  of the  investment  period  by 50% due to a lower  than
expected  level  of  deployment  of the  Fund's  capital.  The  Company  expects
approximately  40% of Fund II's  committed  capital to be invested at the end of
the investment  period on April 9, 2003,  further reducing  management fees from
Fund II in 2003. The Company is also entitled to receive incentive payments from
Fund II if the return on invested  equity is in excess of 10%. The amount of any
such  payments is not  determinable  at December 31, 2002 and as such, no amount
has  been  accrued  as  income  for such  potential  payments  in the  financial
statements.  Potential  incentive  payments received as Fund II winds down could
result in  significant  additional  income from  operations  in certain  periods
during which such payments can be recorded as income.

In 2001 and 2002 in connection with the  organization of Fund I and Fund II, the
Company issued to affiliates of Citigroup  warrants to purchase 8,528,467 shares
of Class A Common Stock. At December 31, 2002, all such warrants had a $5.00 per
share exercise price,  were  exercisable and were to expire on March 8, 2005. In
January 2003,  the Company  purchased all of the warrants  outstanding  from the
affiliates of Citigroup for $2.1 million.

The  Company's   current   lending  and  investment   activities  are  conducted
principally  through  funds under  management.  Until the end of the  investment
period for Fund II on April 9, 2003, the Company generally will not originate or
acquire loans or CMBS directly for its own balance  sheet  portfolio.  After the
investment  period for Fund II, the Company plans to originate loans or purchase
investments  for its own account as permitted by future funds under  management.
The Company will also use its available working capital to make contributions to
Fund II or any other funds as and when  required by the capital  commitments  to
such  funds.  As a result,  if the amount of the  Company's  maturing  loans and
investments increases significantly before excess capital is invested in Fund II
or other funds, or otherwise  accretively  deployed,  the Company may experience
shortfalls in revenues and lower earnings until offsetting  revenues are derived
from funds under  management  or other  sources.  In 2003,  the Company does not
expect a significant decrease in total assets as additional  reductions in loans
and  investments  from  satisfactions  will  require  the Company to purchase or
originate additional 1940-Act qualifying assets.

Developments with and Contributions to Funds
--------------------------------------------

The Company's investment in Fund I at December 31, 2002 is $10.0 million.  Since
December 31, 2001, the Company has not made any equity  contributions  to Fund I
and has received  $10.1 million as a return of equity.  As of December 31, 2002,
Fund I has  outstanding  loans and  investments  totaling $50.2 million,  all of
which are performing in accordance with the terms of their agreements.  One loan
for $26.0  million,  which was in default  and for which the accrual of interest
had been  suspended,  was  written  and  distributed  pro-rata to the members in
December 2002. Upon receipt of its pro-rata share of the loan with a face amount
of $6,500,000, the Company disposed of the asset.

Since December 31, 2001, the Company has made equity contributions to Fund II of
$5.2 million and equity  contributions to Fund II's general partner of $823,000.
The Company's  remaining equity commitment to Fund II and its general partner is
$39.9 million.  The Company's  investment in Fund II and its general  partner at
December  31,  2002 is $18.9  million.  As of  December  31,  2002,  Fund II has
outstanding  loans and investments  totaling  $723.5  million,  all of which are
performing in accordance with the terms of their agreements.

The Company has  capitalized  costs of $8,528,000  that are being amortized over
the anticipated lives of the Funds.

Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The  Company  reported  a net  loss  allocable  to  shares  of  Common  Stock of
$9,738,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $18,502,000  from
the net income  allocable to shares of Common Stock of  $8,764,000  for the year
ended December 31, 2001. This decrease was primarily the result of the inability
to  utilize  capital  losses  generated  in 2002 to reduce  current  taxes,  the
write-down  of  deferred  tax assets as a result of the  decision  to elect REIT
status,  the  settlement  of three cash flow hedges  resulting in a $6.7 million
charge to earnings,  the write-down of a loan in Fund I which caused a loss from
equity  investments  in Funds and decreased  net interest  income from loans and
other  investments.  These decreases were partially offset by increased advisory
and investment management fees, a recapture of the allowance for possible credit
losses and the elimination of the Preferred Stock dividend.  The Company expects
additional  reductions in interest and related income due to declining  interest
earning  assets  that may not be  offset by  increased  income  from  investment
management operations.

Interest  and  related  income  from  loans and other  investments  amounted  to
$47,079,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $20,254,000 from
the $67,333,000  amount for the year ended December 31, 2001.  Average  interest
earning assets  decreased from  approximately  $570.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001 to  approximately  $473.7  million for the year ended December
31, 2002. The average  interest rate earned on such assets  decreased from 11.8%
in 2001 to 9.9% in 2002.  During the year ended  December 31, 2002,  the Company
recognized  $1.6 million in additional  income on the early  repayment of loans,
while  during the year ended  December  31, 2001,  the Company  recognized  $4.8
million in  additional  income on the early  repayment  of loans.  Without  this
additional  interest  income,  the  earning  rate for 2002  would have been 9.6%
versus 11.0% for 2001. LIBOR rates averaged 1.8% for the year ended December 31,
2002 and 3.9% for the year ended  December 31,  2001, a decrease of 2.1%.  Since
substantial  portions of the Company's assets earn interest at fixed-rates,  the
decrease in the average  earning rate did not correspond to the full decrease in
the average LIBOR rate.

Interest  and  related  expenses  amounted  to  $17,969,000  for the year  ended
December 31, 2002, a decrease of $8,269,000 from the $26,238,000  amount for the
year ended  December 31, 2001.  The decrease in expense was due to a decrease in
the  amount  of  average   interest   bearing   liabilities   outstanding   from
approximately   $321.8   million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2001  to
approximately  $260.0  million  for the year  ended  December  31,  2002,  and a
decrease in the average rate paid on interest  bearing  liabilities from 8.2% to
6.9% for the same periods. The decrease in the average rate is substantially due
to the increased  use of repurchase  agreements as debt in 2002 at lower spreads
to LIBOR than the credit  facilities  utilized  in 2001 and the  decrease in the
average LIBOR rate.  Due to the decrease in total debt,  the  percentage of debt
that has been swapped to fixed rates in 2002 increased, partially offsetting the
previously discussed decreases in floating rates.

The Company also utilized  proceeds from the $150.0 million of Convertible Trust
Preferred  Securities,  which  were  issued  on July  28,  1998 to  finance  its
interest-earning  assets. During the years ended

                                       11

December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company  recognized  $8,455,000 and  $8,479,000,
respectively,  of net  expenses  related to its  outstanding  Convertible  Trust
Preferred  Securities.  This amount  consisted of  distributions  to the holders
totaling $14,439,000 and $15,237,000, respectively, and amortization of discount
and origination costs totaling $1,305,000 and $799,000, respectively, during the
years ended  December  31,  2002 and 2001.  This was  partially  offset by a tax
benefit of $7,289,000  and  $7,557,000  during the years ended December 31, 2002
and 2001,  respectively.  On April 1, 2002, in accordance  with the terms of the
securities, the blended rate on such securities increased from 10.16% to 11.21%.
On October 1, 2002, after repayment of the Non-Convertible  Amount (as discussed
below),  the rate on such securities is 10.00%. The increase in the amortization
of  discount  and  origination  costs  resulted  from  the  recognition  of  the
unamortized  discount  and  fees on the  Non-Convertible  Amount  expensed  upon
repayment of the Non-Convertible Amount on September 30, 2002.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, other revenues decreased  $1,403,000 to
$9,924,000  from  $11,327,000  in the same  period of 2001.  During  the  second
quarter of 2001, Fund II commenced operations, which accounted for approximately
$2.6 million of additional  management  and advisory  fees in 2002.  The Company
also  recognized  $2.0  million  from the  Company's  final  investment  banking
assignment.  These increases were offset by the write-down of a $26 million loan
in  Fund  I,  which  decreased  income  from  equity  investments  in  funds  by
approximately $6 million.

General and administrative  expenses decreased $1,386,000 to $13,996,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2002 from  $15,382,000 for year ended December 31, 2001.
The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to reduced
executive  compensation.  The Company employed an average of 27 employees during
both the year ended  December 31, 2002 and the year ended December 31, 2001. The
Company had 26 full-time  employees and one  part-time  employee at December 31,
2002.

During the year ended  December 31, 2002, the Company  recaptured  $4,713,000 of
its previously  established  allowance for possible  credit losses.  The Company
deemed this  recapture  necessary due to the  substantial  reduction in the loan
portfolio  and a general  reduction in the default  risk of the loans  remaining
based upon current  conditions.  After the recapture,  the Company believes that
the  reserve  is  adequate  based on the  existing  loans in the  balance  sheet
portfolio.

For the year ended  December 31, 2002 and 2001,  the Company  accrued income tax
expense of $22,438,000 and  $16,882,000,  respectively,  for federal,  state and
local income  taxes.  The increase  (from 48.6% to 106.1%) in the  effective tax
rate was primarily due to capital  losses being  generated in 2002 that were not
deductible  for tax purposes in the current  year and the  reduction in deferred
tax assets due to the  uncertainty of use in the future.  In December 2002, when
the decision to elect REIT status for 2003 was complete,  the Company wrote down
its deferred tax asset to $1.6  million,  due to the inability of the Company to
utilize the  recorded  tax benefits in the future.  The  remaining  $1.6 million
deferred tax asset relates to future reversals of taxable income in subsidiaries
which will be taxable REIT subsidiaries.

The preferred  stock  dividend and dividend  requirement  arose from  previously
issued shares of Class A Preferred Stock. Dividends accrued on these shares at a
rate of 9.5% per annum on a per share  price of $2.69.  In the third  quarter of
2000,  5,946,825  shares of Class A Preferred Stock were converted into an equal
number  of  shares  of Class A Common  Stock  thereby  reducing  the  number  of
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock to 6,320,833 and the dividend  requirement
to $1,615,000 per annum.  In 2001, the remaining  shares of Preferred Stock were
repurchased thereby eliminating the dividend requirement.

Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The  Company  reported  net  income  allocable  to  shares  of  Common  Stock of
$8,764,000  for the year ended  December 31, 2001,  an increase of $618,000 from
the net income  allocable to shares of Common Stock of  $8,146,000  for the year
ended  December 31, 2000.  This  increase was  primarily the result of increased
income from equity  investments in the Funds and related  investment  management
and consulting  fees,  reduced  Preferred Stock dividends and a reduction in the
provision for possible credit losses offset by decreased advisory and investment
banking fees and decreased net interest income from loans and other investments.

Interest  and  related  income  from  loans and other  investments  amounted  to
$67,333,000 for the year ended

                                       12


<PAGE>


December 31, 2001, a decrease of $20,352,000 from the $87,685,000 amount for the
year ended December 31, 2000.  Average  interest  earning assets  decreased from
approximately   $681.5   million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2000  to
approximately  $570.6  million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The average
interest  rate  earned on such assets  decreased  from 12.8% in 2000 to 11.8% in
2001.  During the year ended  December 31, 2001,  the Company  recognized a $4.8
million in additional  interest  income on the early  repayment of loans,  while
during the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company  recognized $4.7 million in
additional  interest  income  on the early  repayment  of  loans.  Without  this
additional interest income and after adjustment of the 2000 rates for the effect
of  recognizing  net swap  payments in  interest  expense  rather than  interest
income,  the earning  rate for 2001 would have been 11.0% versus 12.2% for 2000.
The decrease in such core-earning rate is due to a decrease in the average LIBOR
rate from 6.41% for 2000 to 3.88% for 2001 for the assets earning interest based
upon a variable rate.

Interest  and  related  expenses  amounted  to  $26,238,000  for the year  ended
December 31, 2001, a decrease of $10,474,000 from the $36,712,000 amount for the
year ended  December 31, 2000.  The decrease in expense was due to a decrease in
the  amount  of  average   interest   bearing   liabilities   outstanding   from
approximately   $393.2   million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2000  to
approximately  $321.8  million  for the year  ended  December  31,  2001,  and a
decrease in the average rate paid on interest  bearing  liabilities from 9.2% to
8.2% for the same periods,  after adjustment of the 2000 rates for the effect of
recognizing net swap payments in interest  expense rather than interest  income.
The  decrease in the average  rate is not  consistent  with the  decrease in the
average  LIBOR rate for the same  periods due to a change in the mix of interest
bearing  liabilities.  In 2001,  a higher  percentage  of the  interest  bearing
liabilities are at a fixed rate, after adjusting for interest rate swaps, which,
in the current  low LIBOR rate  environment,  are at higher  rates than that for
variable rate interest-bearing liabilities.

During the years  ended  December  31,  2001 and 2000,  the  Company  recognized
$8,479,000  and  $7,921,000,  respectively,  of  net  expenses  related  to  its
outstanding  Convertible  Trust Preferred  Securities.  This amount consisted of
distributions to the holders totaling $15,237,000 and $14,246,000, respectively,
and  amortization  of discount  and  origination  costs  totaling  $799,000  and
$799,000, respectively,  during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. This
was partially  offset by a tax benefit of $7,557,000 and  $7,124,000  during the
years  ended  December  31,  2001  and  2000,  respectively.  The  terms  of the
Convertible  Trust  Preferred  Securities  were modified  effective May 10, 2000
which resulted in the blended rate on such  securities  increasing from 8.25% to
10.16% on that date, accounting for the increase in expense in 2001.

During the year ended December 31, 2001, other revenues increased  $4,756,000 to
$11,327,000  from  $6,571,000  in the same  period of 2000.  During  the  second
quarter of 2000,  Fund I commenced  operations  and during the second quarter of
2001,  Fund II commenced  operations.  This  increase in other revenue is due to
increased  revenue from the Funds (management and advisory income in addition to
the return on  investment  in the funds)  offset by a reduction  in advisory and
investment banking fees.

Investment  management  and  consulting  fees from funds  under  management  has
increased  significantly  since  the  closing  of Fund II.  The  Company  earned
$5,884,000  of  investment  management  fees  from  Fund  II and  $1,015,000  of
consulting  fees from the general partner of Fund II in 2001.  These  additional
fees  account for the  majority of the  increase in  investment  management  and
consulting fees from 2000 to 2001.

For the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had earned $2,991,000
and $1,530,000 respectively, on its equity investment in the Funds. The increase
in  income in 2001  versus  2000 was due  primarily  to the  increased  level of
investment in the Funds offset by the suspension of interest on a Fund I asset.

General and administrative  expenses remained relatively consistent amounting to
$15,382,000  for the year ended  December 31, 2001 versus  $15,439,000  for year
ended  December  31,  2000.  In 2000,  as the  Company  transitioned  to its new
investment  management  business,  it incurred one-time expenses of $2.1 million
that were included in general and administrative  expenses. The Company employed
an average of 27  employees  during the year ended  December  31, 2001 verses an
average of 24 employees during the year ended December 31, 2000. The Company had
28 full-time employees and one part-time employee at December 31, 2001.

The decrease in the provision for possible credit losses from $5,478,000 for the
year ended  December 31, 2000 to $748,000  for the year ended  December 31, 2001
was due to the decrease in average earning assets as previously  described.  The
Company did not add to the reserve for possible credit losses

                                       13


<PAGE>


during the second,  third or fourth quarter of 2001 as the Company believed that
the reserve was adequate  based on the  existing  loans and  investments  in the
balance sheet portfolio.

For the year ended  December 31, 2001 and 2000,  the Company  accrued income tax
expense of $16,882,000 and  $17,760,000,  respectively,  for federal,  state and
local income taxes. The decrease (from 50.1% to 48.6%) in the effective tax rate
was  primarily  due to higher  levels of  compensation  in excess of  deductible
limits in the prior year.

The preferred  stock  dividend and dividend  requirement  arose from  previously
issued shares of Class A Preferred Stock. Dividends accrued on these shares at a
rate of 9.5% per annum on a per share  price of $2.69.  In the third  quarter of
1999,  5,946,825  shares of Class A Preferred Stock were converted into an equal
number  of  shares  of Class A Common  Stock  thereby  reducing  the  number  of
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock to 6,320,833 and the dividend  requirement
to $1,615,000 per annum.  In 2001, the remaining  shares of Preferred Stock were
repurchased thereby eliminating the dividend requirement.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
--------------------------------

At December 31, 2002, the Company had  $10,186,000 in cash. The primary  sources
of liquidity for the Company for 2003 will be cash on hand,  cash generated from
operations,  principal and interest  payments  received on loans and investments
and additional  borrowings  under the Company's credit  facilities.  The Company
believes these sources of capital will adequately meet future cash requirements.
The Company  expects that during 2003, it will use a  significant  amount of its
available  capital  resources to satisfy its capital  contributions  required in
connection with its remaining equity commitment to Fund II and future funds. The
Company  intends to continue to employ  leverage on its existing  balance  sheet
assets to enhance its return on equity.

The Company  experienced a net decrease in cash of $1,465,000 for the year ended
December 31,  2002,  compared to the net increase of $263,000 for the year ended
December  31,  2001.  Cash used by  operating  activities  during the year ended
December 31, 2002 was $23,988,000,  compared to $12,769,000  provided during the
same period of 2001.  For the year ended  December  31, 2002,  cash  provided by
investing activities was $301,336,000, compared to $40,034,000 used in investing
activities during the same period in 2001 as the Company experienced significant
loan and investment repayments in both years but purchased significant levels of
available-for-sale securities in 2001. The Company utilized the cash received on
loan repayments in both years to reduce  borrowings under its credit  facilities
and  entered   into   repurchase   obligations   to  finance  the   purchase  of
available-for-sale  securities  in 2001 which  accounted for the majority of the
change in the net cash provided by financing activities from $27,528,000 in 2001
to the  $278,813,000 of cash used in financing  activities in the same period of
2002.

Since  December 31, 2001,  the Company has not  originated  or purchased any new
loans and has no  future  commitments  under any  existing  loans.  The  Company
received full  satisfaction  of three loans  totaling  $90.0 million and partial
repayments on five loans  totaling  $46.2 million in 2002. At December 31, 2002,
the Company had outstanding loans totaling approximately $116.3 million and held
CMBS and  other  available-for-sale  securities  of  $155.8  million  and  $65.2
million, respectively.

In 2000,  the Company  announced an open market share  repurchase  program under
which the Company may purchase,  from time to time, up to two million  shares of
the Company's Class A Common Stock.  Since that time the  authorization has been
increased  by the board of directors  to purchase  cumulatively  up to 7,100,770
shares of Class A Common  Stock.  As of  December  31,  2002,  the  Company  had
purchased  and  retired,  pursuant to the program,  4,902,470  shares of Class A
Common  Stock at an average  price of $4.36 per share  (including  commissions).
Also, during fiscal year 2001, the Company repurchased 830,701 shares of Class A
Common Stock, all 2,755,186  outstanding  shares of Class B Common Stock and all
6,320,833  outstanding  shares of Preferred Stock in three privately  negotiated
transactions  outside the open market share repurchase program.  The Company has
and will continue to fund share repurchases with available cash.

At  December  31,  2002,  the  Company  was  party to a credit  facility  with a
commercial  lender  that  provides  for a total of $100  million of credit.  The
facility matures in July 2003, with an automatic nine-month amortizing extension
option,  if not  otherwise  extended.  At  December  31,  2002,  the Company had
outstanding borrowings under the credit facility of $40,000,000,  and had unused
potential credit of $60,000,000.  The credit facility  provides the Company with
adequate  liquidity for its short-term  needs.

                                       14

The credit  facility  provides  for advances to fund  lender-approved  loans and
investments made by the Company. The obligations of the Company under the credit
facility  are  required  to be secured by  pledges of the assets  originated  or
acquired by the Company  with  advances  under the credit  facility.  Borrowings
under the credit  facility  bear interest at specified  rates over LIBOR,  which
rates may fluctuate, based upon the credit quality of the pledged assets. Future
repayments  and  redrawdowns of amounts  previously  subject to the drawdown fee
will not require the Company to pay any  additional  fees.  The credit  facility
provides for margin  calls on  asset-specific  borrowings  in the event of asset
quality  and/or  market  value  deterioration  as  determined  under the  credit
facility. The credit facility contains customary representations and warranties,
covenants and conditions and events of default.

On February 28, 2002, the Company's  then existing $355 million credit  facility
matured and the term redeemable securities contract became due and settled, upon
which events the Company entered into a new term redeemable  securities contract
and two new repurchase obligations. The new term redeemable securities contract,
with the same counterparty,  allows for a maximum financing of $75 million.  The
new term  redeemable  securities  contract has a two-year term with an automatic
one-year amortizing extension option, if not otherwise extended. The Company has
no borrowings  against the term redeemable  securities  contract at December 31,
2002.

At December 31, 2002, the Company also has outstanding repurchase obligations of
$160,056,000. The average interest rate in effect for the repurchase obligations
outstanding  at December 31, 2002 was 1.90%.  The Company  expects to enter into
new repurchase obligations at their maturity.

In July 1998,  the Company  issued $150  million  aggregate  liquidation  amount
Convertible  Trust  Preferred  Securities  through  the  Company's  consolidated
statutory trust subsidiary, CT Convertible Trust I (the "Trust"), which were and
originally  represented  an undivided  beneficial  interest in the assets of the
Trust that consisted solely of the Company's  $154,650,000  aggregate  principal
amount  8.25%  step up  convertible  junior  subordinated  debentures  that were
concurrently  issued  and sold to the Trust.  The  Convertible  Trust  Preferred
Securities  were  modified  in May 2000 in a  transaction  pursuant to which the
outstanding  securities were canceled and new variable step up Convertible Trust
Preferred  Securities  with an  aggregate  liquidation  amount  of $150  million
("Convertible  Trust  Preferred  Securities")  were issued to the holders of the
canceled  securities  in  exchange   therefore,   and  the  original  underlying
convertible  debentures  were canceled and new 8.25% step up convertible  junior
subordinated  debentures in the aggregate  principal  amount of $92,524,000 (the
"Convertible   Debentures")   and  new  13%  step  up   non-convertible   junior
subordinated  debentures in the aggregate  principal  amount of $62,126,000 (the
"Non-Convertible  Debentures" and together with the Convertible Debentures,  the
"Debentures")  were issued to the Trust, as the holder of the canceled bonds, in
exchange  therefore.  The liquidation  amount of the Convertible Trust Preferred
Securities is divided into $89,742,000 of convertible  amount (the  "Convertible
Amount")  and  $60,258,000  of  non-convertible   amount  (the  "Non-Convertible
Amount"), the distribution,  redemption and, as applicable,  conversion terms of
which, mirror the interest,  redemption and, as applicable, the conversion terms
of the Convertible Debentures and the Non-Convertible Debentures,  respectively,
held by the Trust.

Distributions  on  the  Convertible  Trust  Preferred   Securities  are  payable
quarterly in arrears on each calendar quarter-end and correspond to the payments
of interest made on the Debentures,  the sole assets of the Trust. Distributions
are payable only to the extent  payments are made in respect to the  Debentures.
The Convertible Trust Preferred  Securities initially bore a blended coupon rate
of 10.16%  per annum  which rate  varies as the  proportion  of the  outstanding
Convertible Amount to the outstanding  Non-Convertible  Amount changes and steps
up in  accordance  with  the  coupon  rate  step  up  terms  applicable  to  the
Convertible Amount and the Non-Convertible Amount.

The  Convertible  Amount bore a coupon rate of 8.25% per annum through March 31,
2002 and  increased  on April 1, 2002 to the  greater  of (i)  10.00% per annum,
increasing  by 0.75% on October 1, 2004 and on each October 1 thereafter or (ii)
a percentage  per annum equal to the  quarterly  dividend paid on a common share
multiplied by four and divided by $7.00.  The Convertible  Amount is convertible
into shares of Class A Common  Stock,  in  increments  of $1,000 in  liquidation
amount,  at a conversion  price of $7.00 per share.  The  Convertible  Amount is
redeemable by the Company,  in whole or in part, on or after September 30, 2004.
The  Non-Convertible  Amount  bore a coupon  rate of 13.00%  per  annum  through
September 30, 2002, when the Company redeemed the entire Non-Convertible Amount.

In December 2002, in order to reduce interest rate  derivatives to proper levels
based on  expected  debt levels for 2003,  the  Company  settled all of its then
outstanding  derivative  securities.  The  Company  also  entered

                                       15


<PAGE>


into two new  interest  rate  cash  flow  swaps  with a  notional  value of $109
million.  These cash flow interest rate swaps effectively  convert floating rate
debt to fixed rate debt, which is utilized to finance assets which earn interest
at fixed rates.

Investment Company Act of 1940
------------------------------

In the quarter ended March 31, 2002, to remain in compliance with 1940-Act,  the
Company  purchased $40.0 million of Federal Home Loan Mortgage  Corporation Gold
fixed rate whole pool mortgage-backed  securities. To finance this purchase, the
Company  entered into a repurchase  obligation  that currently  matures in April
2003 and is expected to be extended  monthly  thereafter.  In total, the Company
sold four Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Gold fixed rate securities with
a market  value of $65.2  million at  December  31,  2002 and the  Company has a
liability,  representing  the obligation to repurchase  these assets,  for $63.1
million.

The Company  continuously  analyzes its  investments  and will adjust  levels of
1940-Act  qualified  assets when and if required for compliance  purposes.  As a
result of this analysis and due to favorable  market  conditions,  in June 2002,
the Company sold three  Federal Home Loan Mortgage  Corporation  Gold fixed rate
whole pool  mortgage-backed  securities  due September 1, 2031 with an amortized
cost of $75,006,000 and completed three sales of CMBS in two issues with a basis
of  $31,012,000.  The  Company  recognized  a net  realized  gain of $711,000 in
conjunction  with these sales.  The Company also  received full payment on three
other CMBS issues that it held with a face value of $36.5 million.

Adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
---------------------------------------------------------------

On January 1, 2001,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities,"  as amended by SFAS No. 138,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Derivative
Instruments  and  Certain  Hedging   Activities."  SFAS  No.  133,  as  amended,
establishes  accounting  and  reporting  standards for  derivative  instruments.
Specifically  SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize  all  derivatives  as
either assets or liabilities in the  consolidated  balance sheets and to measure
those instruments at fair value.  Additionally,  the fair value adjustments will
affect  either  shareholders'  equity or net income  depending  on  whether  the
derivative  instrument  qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so,
the nature of the hedging  activity.  As of January 1, 2001, the adoption of the
new  standard  results  in  an  adjustment  of  $574,000  to  accumulated  other
comprehensive loss.

Financial reporting for hedges  characterized as fair value hedges and cash flow
hedges are different.  For those hedges characterized as a fair value hedge, the
changes in fair value of the hedge and the hedged item are reflected in earnings
each  quarter.  In the case of the fair value hedge,  the Company is hedging the
component of interest  rate risk that can be directly  controlled by the hedging
instrument,  and it is this portion of the hedged  assets that is  recognized in
earnings. The non-hedged balance is classified as an available-for-sale security
consistent with SFAS No. 115, and is reported in accumulated other comprehensive
income.  For those  hedges  characterized  as cash flow hedges,  the  unrealized
gains/losses in the fair value of these hedges are reported on the balance sheet
with a corresponding adjustment to either accumulated other comprehensive income
or in earnings,  depending on the type of hedging  relationship.  In  accordance
with SFAS No. 133, on December 31, 2002,  the derivative  financial  instruments
were  reported  at their  fair  value as  interest  rate  hedge  liabilities  of
$1,822,000.

The  Company is exposed to credit  loss in the event of  non-performance  by the
counterparties  to the interest rate swap and cap  agreements,  although it does
not anticipate such non-performance.  The counterparties would bear the interest
rate risk of such transactions as market interest rates increase.

Impact of Inflation
-------------------

The Company's  operating  results depend in part on the  difference  between the
interest income earned on its  interest-earning  assets and the interest expense
incurred in connection  with its  interest-bearing  liabilities.  Changes in the
general level of interest rates prevailing in the economy in response to changes
in the rate of  inflation  or  otherwise  can  affect  the  Company's  income by
affecting  the  spread  between  the  Company's   interest-earning   assets  and
interest-bearing  liabilities,  as well as, among other things, the value of the
Company's interest-earning assets and its ability to realize gains from the sale
of  assets  and the  average  life  of the  Company's  interest-earning  assets.
Interest  rates are highly  sensitive to many  factors,  including  governmental
monetary and tax  policies,  domestic and  international  economic and political
considerations, and other factors beyond the control of the Company. The Company
employs the use of correlated hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes
in interest rates on its operations,  including  engaging in interest rate swaps
and interest  rate caps to minimize  its exposure to changes in interest  rates.
There can be no assurance  that the Company will be able to  adequately  protect
against the  foregoing  risks or that the  Company  will  ultimately  realize an
economic benefit from any hedging contract into which it enters.

Item 7A.       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The principal objective of the Company's  asset/liability  management activities
is to maximize net interest  income,  while  minimizing  levels of interest rate
risk.  Net  interest  income and  interest  expense  are  subject to the risk of
interest rate  fluctuations.  To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest
rates,  the Company uses interest rate swaps to  effectively  convert fixed rate
assets  to  variable  rate  assets  for  proper   matching  with  variable  rate
liabilities and variable rate  liabilities to fixed rate  liabilities for proper
matching with fixed rate assets. Each derivative used as a hedge is matched with
an asset or liability with which it has a high correlation.  The swap agreements
are generally held-to-maturity and the Company does not use derivative financial
instruments  for trading  purposes.  The  Company  uses  interest  rate swaps to
effectively  convert  variable  rate debt to fixed  rate  debt for the  financed
portion of fixed rate assets.  The  differential to be paid or received on these
agreements is recognized  as an  adjustment to the interest  expense  related to
debt and is recognized on the accrual basis.

The  following  table  provides   information  about  the  Company's   financial
instruments  that are  sensitive  to changes in interest  rates at December  31,
2002. For financial assets and debt  obligations,  the table presents cash flows
to the expected  maturity  and  weighted-average  interest  rates based upon the
current  carrying values.  For interest rate swaps, the table presents  notional
amounts and  weighted-average  fixed pay and variable  receive interest rates by
contractual  maturity  dates.   Notional  amounts  are  used  to  calculate  the
contractual  cash flows to be  exchanged  under the  contract.  Weighted-average
variable rates are based on rates in effect as of the reporting date.

Item 14.       Controls and Procedures
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation of the  effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's
"disclosure  controls and  procedures"  (as defined in Rule 13a-14(c)  under the
Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  "Exchange  Act")) was carried
out within 90 days prior to the filing of this annual  report.  This  evaluation
was made  under the  supervision  and with the  participation  of the  Company's
management,  including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial  Officer.
Based upon this  evaluation,  the Company's  Chief  Executive  Officer and Chief
Financial  Officer have  concluded  that the Company's  disclosure  controls and
procedures (a) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in reports  filed or  submitted  under the Exchange Act is timely
recorded,   processed,   summarized  and  reported  and  (b)  include,   without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted  under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's  management,  including its
Chief  Executive  Officer and Chief Financial  Officer,  as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Controls

There have been no significant  changes in the Company's internal controls or in
other factors that could  significantly  affect these controls subsequent to the
date of the Company's evaluation.

                         Report of Independent Auditors




The Board of Directors
Capital Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Capital Trust,
Inc. and Subsidiaries  (the "Company") as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
related  consolidated  statements of operations,  stockholders'  equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December 31, 2002.  These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the consolidated  financial  position of the Company at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31,
2002, in conformity with accounting  principles generally accepted in the United
States.

1.  Organization

Capital Trust, Inc. (the "Company") is an investment  management and real estate
finance company that specializes in providing  structured  capital  solutions to
owner/operators of commercial real estate. In December 2002, the Company's board
of  directors  authorized  an election  to be taxed as a real estate  investment
trust ("REIT") for the 2003 tax year. The Company will continue to make, for its
own account and as investment manager for the account of funds under management,
loans and  debt-related  investments in various types of commercial  real estate
assets and operating companies. The Company's business strategy is to expand its
investment  management business by sponsoring  additional real estate investment
funds and expanding the scope of its products.

The Company is the  successor to Capital  Trust,  a California  business  trust,
following  consummation of the  reorganization on January 28, 1999,  pursuant to
which  the  predecessor  ultimately  merged  with and into  the  Company,  which
thereafter  continued as the surviving  Maryland  corporation.  Each outstanding
predecessor  class A common share of beneficial  interest was converted into one
share of class A common  stock,  par  value  $0.01  per  share  ("Class A Common
Stock"),  and each outstanding  predecessor class A 9.5% cumulative  convertible
preferred  share of beneficial  interest was converted into one share of class A
9.5% cumulative convertible preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class A
Preferred  Stock"),  of the  Company.  As a  result,  all  of the  predecessor's
previously  issued  class A common  shares  of  beneficial  interest  have  been
reclassified  as  shares of Class A Common  Stock  and all of the  predecessor's
previously  issued class A preferred  shares of  beneficial  interest  have been
reclassified as shares of Class A Preferred Stock.  Unless the context otherwise
requires,  hereinafter references to the business, assets, liabilities,  capital
structure,   operations  and  affairs  of  the  Company  include  those  of  the
predecessor prior to the reorganization.

2.  Venture with Citigroup Investments Inc.

On March 8,  2000,  the  Company  entered  into a  venture  with  affiliates  of
Citigroup Alternative  Investments Inc.  (collectively  "Citigroup") pursuant to
which they agreed,  among other things,  to co-sponsor  and invest  capital in a
series of commercial real estate  mezzanine  private equity funds managed by the
Company.

Pursuant to the governing venture agreement, the Company and Citigroup formed CT
Mezzanine  Partners  I LLC  ("Fund  I") in  March  2000,  to  which a  Citigroup
affiliate and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, as members thereof, made
capital  commitments  of up to  $150  million  and  $50  million,  respectively.
Pursuant to the venture  agreement,  the Company and Citigroup  co-sponsored the
second commercial real estate mezzanine  investment fund, CT Mezzanine  Partners
II LP ("Fund  II"),  which  effected its final  closing on third party  investor
equity  commitments  in August  2001.  Fund II has total equity  commitments  of
$845.2  million  including  $49.7 million and $198.9 million made by the Company
and  Citigroup,  respectively.  A wholly owned  subsidiary  of the  Company,  CT
Investment  Management Co., LLC ("CTIMCO"),  serves as the exclusive  investment
manager to Fund I and Fund II.

Based upon the $845.2 million aggregate capital  commitments made at the initial
and  subsequent  closings,  the Company  earned  approximately  $9.6  million of
management and advisory fees in 2002 from its management of Fund II. In November
2002,  the general  partner  announced its intention to  voluntarily  reduce the
management fees charged to partners by 50% effective January 1, 2003.

2.  Venture with Citigroup Investments Inc., continued

In connection  with the  organization of Fund I, the Company issued a warrant to
Citigroup to purchase 4.25 million shares of Class A Common Stock. In connection
with the  closings on investor  equity  commitments  to Fund II, the Company had
issued to Citigroup  warrants to purchase 4,278,467 shares of its Class A Common
Stock.  In total,  the Company had issued to Citigroup four warrants to purchase
8,528,467  shares  of its  Class A Common  Stock  which  had a $5.00  per  share
exercise  price,  were  exercisable  and were to  expire on March 8,  2005.  The
Company  capitalized  such costs that are being  amortized over the  anticipated
lives of the Funds.  The Company has no further  obligations to issue additional
warrants to  Citigroup  at  December  31,  2002.  In January  2003,  the Company
purchased all of the outstanding warrants for $2.1 million.

3.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly  owned  subsidiaries,  CTIMCO (as  described  in Note 2),
CT-F1,  LLC (direct member and equity owner of Fund I),  CT-F2-LP,  LLC (limited
partner of Fund II),  CT-F2-GP,  LLC (direct  member and equity owner of Fund II
GP), CT-BB Funding Corp.  (financing  subsidiary for three mezzanine  loans), CT
Convertible  Trust  I (as  described  in  Note  13),  CT LF  Funding  Corp.  LLC
(financing subsidiary for all of the Company's CMBS securities),  CT BSI Funding
Corp.  LLC and VIC,  Inc.,  which  together with the Company  wholly owns Victor
Capital Group, L.P.  ("Victor  Capital") and VCG Montreal  Management,  Inc. All
significant  intercompany  balances and  transactions  have been  eliminated  in
consolidation.

Revenue Recognition

Interest  income for the Company's  mortgage and other loans and  investments is
recognized over the life of the investment  using the effective  interest method
and recognized on the accrual basis.

Fees received in connection with loan commitments,  net of direct expenses,  are
deferred until the loan is advanced and are then recognized over the term of the
loan as an  adjustment  to yield.  Fees on  commitments  that expire  unused are
recognized at expiration.  Exit fees are also recognized over the estimated term
of the loan as an adjustment to yield.

Income  recognition is generally  suspended for loans at the earlier of the date
at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in the opinion of management,
a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful.  Income recognition is
resumed  when  the  loan  becomes   contractually  current  and  performance  is
demonstrated to be resumed.

Fees from  investment  management  services  are  recognized  when  earned on an
accrual basis. Fees from professional advisory services are generally recognized
at  the  point  at  which  all  Company  services  have  been  performed  and no
significant  contingencies  exist with respect to entitlement  to payment.  Fees
from asset management services are recognized as services are rendered.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company  classifies  highly liquid  investments with original  maturities of
three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents.  At December
31, 2002 and 2001,  a majority  of the cash and cash  equivalents  consisted  of
overnight  investments in JP Morgan  commercial  paper.  The Company had no bank
balances in excess of federally  insured  amounts at December 31, 2002 and 2001.
The Company has not  experienced any losses on its demand  deposits,  commercial
paper or money market investments.

3.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

Available-for-Sale Securities

Available-for-sale  securities are reported on the consolidated balance sheet at
fair value  with any  corresponding  temporary  change in value  reported  as an
unrealized  gain or loss  (if  assessed  to be  temporary),  as a  component  of
comprehensive income in stockholders' equity, net of related income taxes.

Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities ("CMBS")

Commercial  mortgage-backed  securities  available-for-sale  are reported on the
consolidated balance sheet at fair value with any corresponding temporary change
in value resulting in an unrealized gain/(loss) being reported as a component of
accumulated  other  comprehensive  income/(loss)  in  the  stockholders'  equity
section of the balance sheet, net of related income taxes.

Income from CMBS is recognized based on the effective  interest method using the
anticipated  yield over the expected life of the  investments.  Changes in yield
resulting  from  prepayments  are  recognized  over  the  remaining  life of the
investment. The Company recognizes impairment on its CMBS whenever it determines
that the impact of  expected  future  credit  losses,  as  currently  projected,
exceeds the impact of the expected future credit losses as originally projected.
Impairment  losses are  determined by comparing the current fair value of a CMBS
to its existing  carrying  amount,  the difference being recognized as a loss in
the current period in the consolidated statements of operations of the period in
which the loss is identified.  Reduced estimates of credit losses are recognized
as an adjustment to yield over the remaining life of the portfolio.

Loans Receivable and Reserve for Possible Credit Losses

Loans receivable are reported on the consolidated  balance sheet at the lower of
cost or market.  The provision for possible credit losses on loans receivable is
the charge to income to increase the reserve for possible  credit  losses to the
level that management estimates to be adequate considering  delinquencies,  loss
experience and collateral quality. Other factors considered relate to geographic
trends  and  product  diversification,  the size of the  portfolio  and  current
economic  conditions.  Based upon these  factors,  the Company  establishes  the
provision for possible  credit losses by category of asset.  When it is probable
that the Company  will be unable to collect all amounts  contractually  due, the
account is considered  impaired.  Where  impairment  is  indicated,  a valuation
write-down  or  write-off  is  measured  based upon the  excess of the  recorded
investment  amount  over the net fair  value of the  collateral,  as  reduced by
selling costs.  Any deficiency  between the carrying  amount of an asset and the
net sales price of  repossessed  collateral is charged to the reserve for credit
losses.

Sales of Real Estate

The Company  complies with the  provisions of the FASB's  Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 66, "Accounting for Sales of Real Estate." Accordingly,
the recognition of gains is deferred until such  transactions have complied with
the criteria for full profit recognition under the statement.


Equity  investment  in CT  Mezzanine  Partners I LLC ("Fund  I"),  CT  Mezzanine
Partners II LP ("Fund II") and CT MP II LLC ("Fund II GP") (together "Funds")

As the Funds are not majority  owned or controlled  by the Company,  the Company
does not consolidate the Funds in its  consolidated  financial  statements.  The
Company  accounts  for  its  interest  in the  Funds  on the  equity  method  of
accounting.  As such,  the Company  reports a percentage  of the earnings of the
Funds  equal  to  its  ownership  percentage  on  a  single  line  item  in  the
consolidated  statement of operations as income from equity  investments  in the
Funds.

Derivative Financial Instruments

In the normal  course of  business,  the  Company  uses a variety of  derivative
financial  instruments  to manage,  or hedge,  interest  rate risk.  The Company
requires  derivative  financial  instruments  to be  effective  in reducing  its
interest rate risk exposure.  This effectiveness is essential for qualifying for
hedge accounting.  When the terms of an underlying  transaction are modified, or
when the underlying  hedged item ceases to exist,  all changes in the fair value
of the  instrument  are  marked-to-market  with changes in value included in net
income each period until the derivative  instrument  matures or is settled.  Any
derivative  instrument  used for risk  management that does not meet the hedging
criteria is marked-to-market with the changes in value included in net income.

The Company uses interest rate swaps to effectively  convert  variable rate debt
to  fixed  rate  debt  for the  financed  portion  of  fixed  rate  assets.  The
differential  to be paid or received on these  agreements  is  recognized  as an
adjustment  to the interest  expense  related to debt and is  recognized  on the
accrual basis.

The Company also uses interest rate caps to reduce its exposure to interest rate
changes on  investments.  The Company will receive  payments on an interest rate
cap should the variable rate for which the cap was purchased  exceed a specified
threshold  level and will be recorded as an  adjustment  to the interest  income
related to the related earning asset.

To  determine  the fair values of  derivative  instruments,  the Company  uses a
variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks
existing at each balance sheet date.  For the majority of financial  instruments
including most derivatives,  long-term  investments and long-term debt, standard
market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis,  option
pricing models,  replacement  cost, and  termination  cost are used to determine
fair  value.   All  methods  of  assessing   fair  value  result  in  a  general
approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.

The swap and cap agreements are generally  held-to-maturity and the Company does
not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Equipment and Leasehold Improvements, Net

Equipment  and  leasehold  improvements,  net, are stated at original  cost less
accumulated  depreciation and  amortization.  Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line  method based on the estimated  lives of the  depreciable  assets.
Amortization is computed over the remaining terms of the related leases.

Expenditures  for maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense at the
time incurred.  Expenditures  determined to represent  additions and betterments
are  capitalized.  Cost of assets  sold or retired  and the  related  amounts of
accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts in the year of sale or
retirement.  Any  resulting  profit  or loss is  reflected  in the  consolidated
statement of operations.

Deferred Debt Issuance Costs

The Company  capitalizes  costs  incurred  related to the  issuance of long-term
debt.  These costs are  deferred  and  reported on balance  sheet in the caption
deferred origination fees and other revenue and are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the life of the related  debt,  which  approximates  the  level-yield
method, and recognized as a component of interest expense.

Income Taxes

The Company records its income taxes in accordance with the FASB's  Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS No.
109").  Under SFAS No. 109,  deferred  income taxes are  recognized  for the tax
consequences  of  "temporary  differences"  by applying  statutory tax rates for
future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and
the tax bases of  existing  assets  and  liabilities.  Deferred  tax  assets are
recognized for temporary  differences that will result in deductible  amounts in
future years and for carryforwards that are useable in future years. A valuation
allowance is  recognized  if it is more likely than not that some portion of the
deferred  asset will not be  recognized.  When  evaluating  whether a  valuation
allowance  is  appropriate,  SFAS No. 109  requires a company to  consider  such
factors as previous  operating results,  future earning potential,  tax planning
strategies and future reversals of existing temporary differences. The valuation
allowance  is  increased  or decreased in future years based on changes in these
criteria.

Amortization of the Excess of Purchase Price Over Net Tangible Assets Acquired

The Company  recognized  the excess of purchase  price over net tangible  assets
acquired in a business  combination  accounted for as a purchase transaction and
is  amortizing  it on a  straight-line  basis  over a period  of 15  years.  The
carrying value of the excess of purchase price over net tangible assets acquired
was  analyzed  quarterly  by the  Company  based upon the  expected  revenue and
profitability  levels of the acquired  enterprise to determine whether the value
and future benefit may indicate a decline in value. The Company  determined that
there had been a decline in the value of the acquired  enterprise and wrote down
the value of the excess of purchase price over net tangible  assets  acquired to
the revised fair value in 2000.

Comprehensive Income

Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted the FASB's Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income" ("SFAS No. 130").
The statement  changes the reporting of certain items currently  reported in the
stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet and establishes  standards for
reporting  of  comprehensive  income  and  its  components  in  a  full  set  of
general-purpose  financial  statements.  Total  comprehensive  income/(loss) was
($8,817,000), ($9,813,000) and $9,773,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively. The primary component of comprehensive income other
than  net  income  was  the  unrealized   gain/(loss)  on  derivative  financial
instruments and available-for-sale  securities,  net of related income taxes. At
December  31,  2002,  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  is  comprised  of
unrealized  losses on CMBS of  $29,402,000  and  unrealized  losses on cash flow
swaps of $1,822,000 offset by unrealized gains on available-for  sale securities
of $2,236,000 netting to a total of $28,988,000.

Earnings per Share of Common Stock

Earnings per share of Common Stock are presented  based on the  requirements  of
the FASB's Statement of Accounting Standards No. 128 ("SFAS No. 128"). Basic EPS
is computed based on the income  applicable to Common Stock (which is net income
or loss reduced by the dividends on the Preferred Stock) divided by the weighted
average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted
EPS is based on the net earnings  applicable  to Common Stock plus, if dilutive,
dividends  on the  Preferred  Stock  and  interest  paid  on  Convertible  Trust
Preferred Securities, net of tax benefit, divided by the weighted average number
of shares of Common Stock and  potentially  dilutive shares of Common Stock that
were outstanding during the period. At December 31, 2002,  potentially  dilutive
shares of Common Stock include  dilutive  Common Stock  warrants and options and
future  commitments  for stock unit awards.  At December  31, 2001,  potentially
dilutive  shares  of Common  Stock  include  the  convertible  Preferred  Stock,
dilutive Common Stock warrants and options and future commitments for stock unit
awards.  At December  31,  2000,  potentially  dilutive  shares of Common  Stock
include the convertible Preferred Stock,  Convertible Trust Preferred Securities
and future commitments for stock unit awards.

3.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States  requires  management to make estimates
and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial  statements and the reported  amounts of revenues and expenses  during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain  reclassifications  have been made in the  presentation  of the 2001 and
2000 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2002 presentation.

Segment Reporting

As the Company manages its operations as one segment, separate segment reporting
is not presented for 2002, 2001 and 2000, as the financial  information for that
segment is the same as the information in the consolidated financial statements.

New Accounting Pronouncement

In January 2003 the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,"Consolidation of Variable
Interest  Entities"  (the  "Interpretation"),  which  provides  new criteria for
determining   whether  or  not   consolidation   accounting  is  required.   The
Interpretation may require the Company to consolidate  financial information for
certain of its investments/managed  entities.  This Interpretation  generally is
effective  for entities with variable  interests in variable  interest  entities
created  after  January 31,  2003;  otherwise,  it is  applicable  for the first
interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. If applicable,
the Interpretation would require consolidation of an investee's/managed entity's
assets  and  liabilities  and  results of  operations,  with  minority  interest
recorded  for  the  ownership  share  applicable  to  other   investors.   Where
consolidation is not required, additional disclosures may be required.

4.  Available-for-Sale Securities

At December 31, 2002, the Company's  available-for-sale  securities consisted of
the following (in thousands):

The Company  purchased  these  securities  on September 28, 2001 at a premium to
yield  6.07% with an  anticipated  average  life of 5.15  years  with  financing
provided by the seller through a repurchase agreement.

During the year ended  December  31,  2000,  the  Company  sold its then  entire
portfolio  of  available-for  sale  securities  at a gain of $35,000  over their
amortized  cost. The cost of securities  sold was determined  using the specific
identification method.

5.  Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities

The  Company  pursues  rated  and  unrated  investments  in public  and  private
subordinated interests ("Subordinated Interests") in CMBS.

Because of a decision to sell a  held-to-maturity  security in 1998, the Company
transferred all of its investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities from
held-to-maturity  securities to available-for-sale and continues to classify the
CMBS as such.

During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company purchased  $36,509,000 face
amount of  interests  in three  subordinated  CMBS issued by a  financial  asset
securitization  investment  trust for  $36,335,000.  In April 2001,  the Company
received $1.4 million of additional  discount from the issuer of the  securities
in settlement of a dispute with the issuer.  In May 2002,  the Company  received
full satisfaction of $36,509,000 face amount of interests in three  subordinated
CMBS issued by a financial asset securitization  investment trust. In connection
with the  early  payoff,  the  Company  recognized  an  additional  $370,000  of
unamortized discount as additional interest income in 2002.

5.  Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities, continued

On March 3, 1999,  the  Company,  through  its then newly  formed  wholly  owned
subsidiary,  CT-BB Funding Corp.,  acquired a portfolio of fixed-rate "BB" rated
CMBS (the "BB CMBS  Portfolio") from an affiliate of an existing credit facility
lender.  The  portfolio,  which  is  comprised  of 11  separate  issues  with an
aggregate face amount of $246.0 million,  was purchased for $196.9  million.  In
connection with the transaction,  an affiliate of the seller provided three-year
term financing for 70% of the purchase price at a floating rate above the London
Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and entered into an interest rate swap with the
Company  for the  full  duration  of the BB CMBS  Portfolio  securities  thereby
providing a hedge for interest  rate risk.  The financing was provided at a rate
that was below the current  market for  similar  financings  and,  as such,  the
carrying  amount of the  assets and the debt were  reduced  by $10.9  million to
adjust the yield on the debt to current market terms. In June 2002,  three sales
of CMBS in two  issues  were  completed.  The  securities,  which had a basis of
$31,012,000  including  amortization  of  discounts,  were sold for  $31,371,000
resulting in a net gain of $359,000.

The  remaining BB CMBS  Portfolio  securities  bear interest at fixed rates that
have an  average  face rate of 7.63% on the face  amount  and  mature at various
dates from  February  2006 to March 2015.  At December  31,  2002,  the expected
average  life for the CMBS  portfolio is 9.1 years.  After giving  effect to the
discounted  purchase price,  the fair value adjustment and the adjustment of the
carrying  amount of the assets to bring the debt to current  market  terms,  the
weighted  average  interest rate in effect for the BB CMBS Portfolio at December
31, 2002 was 13.66%.

6.  Loans Receivable

The Company  currently pursues lending  opportunities  designed to capitalize on
inefficiencies  in the real estate capital,  mortgage and finance  markets.  The
Company  has  classified  its  loans  receivable  into  the  following   general
categories:

     o    Mortgage Loans.  The Company  originates or acquires senior and junior
          mortgage loans ("Mortgage Loans") to commercial real estate owners and
          property  developers who require  interim  financing  until  permanent
          financing can be obtained.  The Company's Mortgage Loans are generally
          not intended to be permanent in nature,  but rather are intended to be
          of a relatively short-term duration,  with extension options as deemed
          appropriate,  and typically  require a balloon payment of principal at
          maturity.  The Company may also originate and fund permanent  Mortgage
          Loans in which the Company intends to sell the senior tranche, thereby
          creating a Mezzanine Loan (as defined below).

     o    Mezzanine  Loans.  The Company  originates  or acquires  high-yielding
          loans that are  subordinate to first lien mortgage loans on commercial
          real  estate and are  secured  either by a second  lien  mortgage or a
          pledge of the  ownership  interests in the  borrowing  property  owner
          ("Mezzanine Loans").  Generally,  the Company's Mezzanine Loans have a
          longer anticipated  duration than its Mortgage Loans, are not intended
          to  serve  as  transitional   mortgage  financing  and  can  represent
          subordinated  investments in real estate operating companies which may
          take the form of secured or unsecured debt,  preferred stock and other
          hybrid instruments.

     o    Other Loans Receivable.  This classification  includes other loans not
          meeting the above criteria.

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company's loans  receivable  consisted of the

principal  and  interest.  In  December  2002,  the  loan  was  written  down to
$4,000,000  through a charge to the allowance  for possible  credit  losses.  In
accordance with the Company's policy for revenue recognition, income recognition
has been suspended on this loan and for the years ended December 31, 2002,  2001

offset by $779,000 of non-recourse  financing of the asset. After the write-off,
both the loan receivable and the non-recourse financing were carried at $779,000
until the non-recourse note payable was foreclosed upon on January 17, 2001. The
loan  was  originated  during  the  Company's  prior  operations  as a  REIT  to
facilitate  the disposal of a previously  foreclosed-upon  asset.  In accordance
with the  Company's  policy for  revenue  recognition,  income  recognition  was
suspended  on this loan and for the year ended  December  31,  2000,  $76,000 of
potential interest income was not recorded.

8.  Excess of Purchase Price Over Net Tangible Assets Acquired

On July 15, 1997,  the Company  consummated  the  acquisition of the real estate
investment banking,  advisory and asset management  businesses of Victor Capital
Group, L.P. and certain affiliated entities.  The acquisition had been accounted
for under the purchase method of accounting. The excess of the purchase price of
the acquisition in excess of net tangible assets acquired approximated $342,000.

The Company  recognized  the excess of purchase  price over net tangible  assets
acquired in a business  combination  accounted for as a purchase transaction and
had been amortizing it on a straight-line  basis over a period of 15 years.  The
carrying value of the excess of purchase price over net tangible assets acquired
was  analyzed  quarterly  by the  Company  based upon the  expected  revenue and
profitability  levels of the acquired  enterprise to determine whether the value
and future benefit may indicate a decline in value.

In April 2000, the Company  increased its level of resources  devoted to its new
investment  management  business and reduced resources devoted to its investment
banking and advisory operations.  As a result, the Company determined that there
has been a decline in the value of the acquired enterprise and the Company wrote
off the remaining value of the excess of purchase price over net tangible assets
acquired.   This  additional  $275,000  write-off  was  recorded  as  additional
amortization expense in the year ended December 31, 2000.

Depreciation and amortization  expense on equipment and leasehold  improvements,
which are  computed on a  straight-line  basis  totaled  $138,000,  $203,000 and
$238,000 for the years ended  December 31,  2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.

10.  Notes Payable

At December 31, 2002, the Company has no notes payable and at December 31, 2001,
the Company had notes payable aggregating $977,000.

In connection with the acquisition of Victor Capital Group,  L.P. and affiliated
entities,  the Company  issued $5.0 million of  non-interest  bearing  unsecured
notes  ("Acquisition  Notes") to the sellers,  both of whom are directors of the
Company and one of whom serves as the chief  executive  officer of the  Company.
The notes were payable in ten semi-annual payments of $500,000.  The Acquisition
Notes were originally discounted to $3,908,000 based on an imputed interest rate
of 9.5%. At December 31, 2002, the Acquisition Notes have been repaid.

11.  Long-Term Debt

Credit Facilities

Effective September 30, 1997, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a
commercial  lender that  provided for a three-year  $150 million line of credit.
Effective January 1, 1998, pursuant to an amended and restated credit agreement,
the Company  increased the available  credit under this facility to $250 million
and  subsequently  further amended the credit agreement to increase the facility
to $300  million  effective  June 22, 1998 and $355 million  effective  July 23,
1998.  The Company  incurred an initial  commitment  fee upon the signing of the
credit agreement and the credit agreement called for additional  commitment fees
when the total borrowing under the credit  facility  exceeded $75 million,  $150
million, $250 million and $300 million. Effective February 26, 1999, pursuant to
an amended and restated credit agreement, the Company extended the expiration of
such credit  facility  from  December  2001 to February  2002 with an  automatic
one-year amortizing extension option, if not otherwise extended. On February 28,
2002, the Company's $355 million credit facility matured and was settled and was
replaced with the repurchase obligations discussed below.

On June 8, 1998, the Company entered into a second credit agreement with another
commercial  lender  that  provides  for a $300  million  line of credit  with an
original  expiration  date in December  1999.  The  Company  incurred an initial
commitment  fee  upon  the  signing  of  this  credit   facility.   The  Company
subsequently  extended the expiration of such credit facility from December 1999
to June  2000 and from  June  2000 to June  2001  with an  automatic  nine-month
amortizing extension option, if not otherwise extended. Effective July 16, 2001,
pursuant to an amended and restated  credit  agreement,  the Company reduced the
amount of credit  under this credit  facility to $100  million and  extended the
expiration  of such credit  facility  from  September  2001 to July 2002 with an
automatic  nine-month  amortizing  extension option, if not otherwise  extended.
Effective July 16, 2002,  pursuant to an amended and restated credit  agreement,
the Company  extended the  expiration of such credit  facility from July 2002 to
July 2003 with an  automatic  nine-month  amortizing  extension  option,  if not
otherwise extended.

The credit  facilities  provide for advances to fund  lender-approved  loans and
investments made by the Company ("Funded Portfolio Assets").  The obligations of
the  Company  under the credit  facilities  are secured by pledges of the Funded
Portfolio Assets acquired with advances under the credit facilities.

             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)


11.  Long-Term Debt, continued

Borrowings  under the credit  facilities  bear interest at specified  rates over
LIBOR,  which rates may  fluctuate,  based upon the credit quality of the Funded
Portfolio  Assets.  Future  repayments  and  redrawdowns  of amounts  previously
subject to the drawdown  fee will not require the Company to pay any  additional
fees.  The  credit  facilities   provide  for  margin  calls  on  asset-specific
borrowings in the event of asset quality  and/or market value  deterioration  as
determined under the credit facilities.  The credit facilities contain customary
representations and warranties,  covenants and conditions and events of default.
The credit  facilities  also contain a covenant  obligating the Company to avoid
undergoing an ownership  change that results in Craig M. Hatkoff,  John R. Klopp
or Samuel Zell no longer retaining their senior offices and  directorships  with
the Company and practical control of the Company's business and operations.  The
providers  of  the  credit   facilities  have  notified  the  Company  that  the
resignation  of Craig M.  Hatkoff as an officer of the Company on  December  29,
2000 is not an event of non-compliance with the foregoing covenant.

At December 31,  2002,  the Company has  borrowed  $40,000,000  against the $100
million credit facility at an average borrowing rate (including  amortization of
fees  incurred  and  capitalized)  of 4.72%.  The Company has pledged  assets of
$81,666,000 as collateral for the borrowing against such credit facility.

On December 31, 2002, the unused amount of potential  credit under the remaining
credit facility was $60,000,000.

Term Redeemable Securities Contract

In connection with the purchase of the BB CMBS Portfolio described in Note 5, an
affiliate of the seller  provided  financing for 70% of the purchase  price,  or
$137.8  million,  at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 50 basis points pursuant to a
term  redeemable  securities  contract.  This rate was below the market rate for
similar financings,  and, as such, a discount on the term redeemable  securities
contract was recorded to reduce the carrying  amount by $10.9 million (which has
been  amortized to  $679,000),  which had the effect of  adjusting  the yield to
current  market terms.  The debt had a three-year  term that expired in February
2002.

On February 28, 2002,  when the Company's $355 million credit  facility  matured
and the term redeemable  securities contract became due and settled, the Company
entered into a new term  redeemable  securities  contract and two new repurchase
obligations.

The new term redeemable  securities  contract was utilized to finance certain of
the assets that were  previously  financed with the maturing credit facility and
term  redeemable  securities  contract.   The  new  term  redeemable  securities
contract,  which allows for a maximum  financing of $75 million,  is recourse to
the Company.  The new term  redeemable  securities  contract has a two-year term
with  an  automatic  one-year  amortizing  extension  option,  if not  otherwise
extended.  The Company  incurred an initial  commitment fee of $750,000 upon the
signing of the new term  redeemable  securities  contract  and the Company  pays
interest at  specified  rates over  LIBOR.  The new term  redeemable  securities
contract  contains  customary  representations  and  warranties,  covenants  and
conditions  and events of default.  The Company  has no  outstanding  borrowings
against the new term redeemable securities contract at December 31, 2002.

Repurchase Obligations

At December 31, 2002,  the Company was  obligated  to two  counterparties  under
repurchase agreements.

The  repurchase  obligation  with the  first  counterparty,  an  affiliate  of a
securities  dealer, was utilized to finance CMBS securities that were previously
financed  with the credit  facility  and  original  term  redeemable  securities
contract.  At December  31,  2002,  the Company sold CMBS assets with a book and
market value of $155,780,000  and has a liability to repurchase these assets for
$97,000,000 that is non-recourse to the Company.  This repurchase obligation has
a one-year term that expired in February 2003 and was  subsequently  extended to
February  2004.  The liability  balance bears  interest at specified  rates over
LIBOR based upon each asset included in the obligation.

             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)


11.  Long-Term Debt, continued

The other  repurchase  obligation  with the  other  counterparty,  a  securities
dealer, arose in connection with the purchase of available-for-sale  securities.
At December  31,  2002,  the Company has sold such assets with a book and market
value  of  $65,233,000  and has a  liability  to  repurchase  these  assets  for
$63,056,000.  This  repurchase  agreement has a maturity date in March 2003. The
liability balance bears interest at LIBOR.

The  interest  rate in effect  for the  repurchase  obligations  outstanding  at
December 31, 2002 was 1.90% and the interest  rate in effect for the  repurchase
obligations outstanding at December 31, 2001 was 2.03%.

12.  Derivative Financial Instruments

On January 1, 2001,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities,"  as amended by SFAS No. 138,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Derivative
Instruments  and  Certain  Hedging   Activities."  SFAS  No.  133,  as  amended,
establishes  accounting  and  reporting  standards for  derivative  instruments.
Specifically  SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize  all  derivatives  as
either assets or liabilities in the  consolidated  balance sheets and to measure
those instruments at fair value.  Additionally,  the fair value adjustments will
affect  either  shareholders'  equity or net income  depending  on  whether  the
derivative  instrument  qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so,
the nature of the hedging  activity.  As of January 1, 2001, the adoption of the
new  standard  resulted  in an  adjustment  of  $574,000  to  accumulated  other
comprehensive loss and other liabilities.

In the  normal  course of  business,  the  Company  is  exposed to the effect of
interest rate changes.  The Company limits these risks by following  established
risk  management  policies  and  procedures  including  those  for  the  use  of
derivatives.  For interest rate  exposures,  derivatives  are used  primarily to
align rate movements  between interest rates associated with the Company's loans
and other financial  assets with interest rates on related debt  financing,  and
manage the cost of borrowing obligations.

The  Company  does not use  derivatives  for  trading or  speculative  purposes.
Further,  the Company has a policy of only  entering into  contracts  with major
financial  institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors.  When
viewed in  conjunction  with the  underlying  and  offsetting  exposure that the
derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss
from those  instruments,  nor does it anticipate any material  adverse effect on
its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.

To manage interest rate risk, the Company may employ options, forwards, interest
rate swaps, caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying
exposure.  To reduce  overall  interest  cost,  the Company uses  interest  rate
instruments, typically interest rate swaps, to convert a portion of its variable
rate debt to fixed rate debt. Interest rate differentials that arise under these
swap  contracts  are  recognized  as  interest  expense  over  the  life  of the
contracts.

Financial reporting for hedges  characterized as fair value hedges and cash flow
hedges are different.  For those hedges characterized as a fair value hedge, the
changes in fair value of the hedge and the hedged item are reflected in earnings
each quarter.  In the case of the fair value hedge listed above,  the Company is
hedging the component of interest  rate risk that can be directly  controlled by
the  hedging  instrument,  and it is this  portion of the hedged  assets that is
recognized   in  earnings.   The   non-hedged   balance  is   classified  as  an
available-for-sale  security  consistent  with  SFAS No.  115,  "Accounting  for
Certain  Investments  in  Debt  and  Equity  Securities,"  and  is  reported  in
accumulated other comprehensive  income. For those hedges  characterized as cash
flow hedges,  the unrealized  gains/losses in the fair value of these hedges are
reported  on  the  balance  sheet  with a  corresponding  adjustment  to  either
accumulated other comprehensive income or in earnings,  depending on the type of
hedging relationship.

12.  Derivative Financial Instruments, continued

The fair value hedge was  undertaken  by the Company to sustain the value of its
CMBS holdings.  This fair value hedge,  when viewed in conjunction with the fair
value of the securities, is sustaining the value of those securities as interest
rates rise and fall.  During the twelve  months ended  December  31,  2001,  the
Company  recognized  a loss of  $5,479,000  for the decrease in the value of the
swap which was  substantially  offset by a gain of $4,890,000  for the change in
the fair value of the  securities  attributed to the hedged risk  resulting in a
$589,000 charge to unrealized loss on derivative  securities on the consolidated
statement of operations.  During the period from January 1, 2002 to December 20,
2002, the Company recognized a loss of $16,234,000 for the decrease in the value
of the swap  which was  substantially  offset by a gain of  $15,924,000  for the
change  in the fair  value  of the  securities  attributed  to the  hedged  risk
resulting in a $310,000  charge to unrealized  loss on derivative  securities on
the  consolidated  statement of operations.  In conjunction with the sale of the
CMBS previously  discussed in Note 5, in order to maintain the  effectiveness of
the hedge,  the  Company  reduced  the  maturity  of the fair  value  hedge from
December 2014 to November  2009 and  recognized a realized gain for the payments
received  totaling  $940,000.  On  December  23,  2002,  in order  to  eliminate
accumulated  earnings and profits in anticipation  of the Company's  election of
REIT status for tax  purposes,  the fair value hedge was settled  resulting in a
realized loss of $23.6 million.

The Company  utilizes cash flow hedges in order to better control interest costs
on variable rate debt  transactions.  Interest rate swaps that convert  variable
payments to fixed payments,  interest rate caps, floors,  collars,  and forwards
are  considered  cash flow  hedges.  During the period  from  January 1, 2002 to
December 20, 2002 and during the year ended December 31, 2001, the fair value of
the cash flow swaps  decreased by $3.3 million and $2.9  million,  respectively,
which was deferred into other comprehensive loss until the cash flow hedges were
settled on  December  23,  2002 and the  settlement  amount of $6.7  million was
recorded as a charge to earnings.

During the period from  January 1, 2002 to December 20, 2002 and during the year
ended December 31, 2001, the Company  recognized a loss of $62,000 and a gain of
$47,000,  respectively for the change in time value for qualifying interest rate
hedges.  The time value is a component of fair value that must be  recognized in
earnings, and is shown in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized
loss on  derivative  securities.  When  the  interest  rate cap was  settled  on
December 23,  2002,  the Company  recognized  a realized  loss of $51,000 on the
consolidated statement of operations.

In December  2002, the Company  entered into two new cash flow hedge  contracts.
The  following  table  summarizes  the  notional  value  and  fair  value of the
Company's derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2002.


                                Notional     Interest
 Hedge           Type            Value         Rate      Maturity    Fair Value
-------    ----------------  -------------  -----------  --------   ------------
 Swap       Cash Flow Hedge   $85,000,000     4.2425%      2015     $(1,435,000)
 Swap       Cash Flow Hedge    24,000,000     4.2325%      2015        (387,000)

On December 31, 2002,  the  derivative  financial  instruments  were reported at
their fair value as interest rate hedge liabilities and the decrease in the fair
value  of  the  cash  flow  swaps  of  $1.8  million  was  deferred  into  other
comprehensive  loss and will be released to earnings over the remaining lives of
the swaps.

Over  time,  the  unrealized   gains  and  losses  held  in  accumulated   other
comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings.  This reclassification is
consistent  with the  timing of when the  hedged  items are also  recognized  in
earnings.  Within the next twelve months, the Company estimates that $3.1million
currently held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to
earnings, with regard to the cash flow hedges.

13.  Convertible Trust Preferred Securities

On July 28, 1998, the Company  privately placed  originally issued 150,000 8.25%
step up Convertible Trust Preferred  Securities  (liquidation  amount $1,000 per
security) with an aggregate liquidation amount of $150 million.

The  Convertible  Trust  Preferred  Securities  were  originally  issued  by the
Company's consolidated  statutory trust subsidiary,  CT Convertible Trust I (the
"Trust") and represented an undivided  beneficial  interest in the assets of the
Trust that consisted  solely of the Company's  8.25% step up convertible  junior
subordinated  debentures in the aggregate  principal amount of $154,650,000 that
were concurrently sold and originally issued to the Trust.  Distributions on the
Convertible Trust Preferred Securities were payable quarterly in arrears on each
calendar  quarter-end  and  correspond  to the payments of interest  made on the
convertible debentures, the sole assets of the Trust. Distributions were payable
only to the extent payments were made in respect to the convertible debentures.

The Company received $145,207,000 in net proceeds, after original issue discount
of 3% from the liquidation amount of the Convertible Trust Preferred  Securities
and transaction expenses, pursuant to the above transactions, which were used to
pay down the  Company's  credit  facilities.  The  Convertible  Trust  Preferred
Securities  were  convertible  into shares of Class A Common Stock at an initial
rate of 85.47 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000  principal amount of the
convertible  debentures  held by the Trust (which is  equivalent to a conversion
price of $11.70 per share of Class A Common Stock).

On May 10, 2000,  the Company  modified the terms of the $150 million  aggregate
liquidation  amount Convertible Trust Preferred  Securities.  In connection with
the modification,  the then outstanding  Convertible Trust Preferred  Securities
were canceled and new variable step up Convertible  Trust  Preferred  Securities
with an aggregate  liquidation amount of $150,000,000 were issued to the holders
of the canceled  securities in exchange  therefore,  and the original underlying
convertible  debentures  were canceled and new 8.25% step up convertible  junior
subordinated debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $92,524,000 and new
13% step up  non-convertible  junior  subordinated  debentures  in the aggregate
principal  amount of $62,126,000  were issued to the Trust, as the holder of the
canceled  bonds,  in  exchange  therefore.  The  liquidation  amount  of the new
Convertible   Trust  Preferred   Securities  was  divided  into  $89,742,000  of
convertible amount (the "Convertible Amount") and $60,258,000 of non-convertible
amount (the  "Non-Convertible  Amount"),  the  distribution,  redemption and, as
applicable, conversion terms of which, mirrored the interest, redemption and, as
applicable,  conversion  terms  of the new  convertible  debentures  and the new
non-convertible debentures, respectively, held by the Trust.

Distributions  on the new  Convertible  Trust  Preferred  Securities are payable
quarterly in arrears on each calendar quarter-end and correspond to the payments
of  interest  made  on the  new  debentures,  the  sole  assets  of  the  Trust.
Distributions are payable only to the extent payments are made in respect to the
new debentures.

The new Convertible Trust Preferred  Securities  initially bore a blended coupon
rate of 10.16% per annum  which rate  varied as the  proportion  of  outstanding
Convertible Amount to the outstanding Non-Convertible Amount changes and were to
step up in  accordance  with the  coupon  rate step up terms  applicable  to the
Convertible Amount and the Non-Convertible Amount.

The  Convertible  Amount bore a coupon rate of 8.25% per annum through March 31,
2002 and  increased  on April 1, 2002 to the  greater  of (i)  10.00% per annum,
increasing  by 0.75% on October 1, 2004 and on each October 1 thereafter or (ii)
a percentage per annum equal to the quarterly dividend paid on a share of common
stock  multiplied  by four and  divided  by  $7.00.  The  Convertible  Amount is
convertible  into shares of Class A Common  Stock,  in  increments  of $1,000 in
liquidation  amount,  at a conversion  price of $7.00 per share. The Convertible
Amount is redeemable by the Company,  in whole or in part, on or after September
30, 2004.

Prior to redemption, the Non-Convertible Amount bore a coupon rate of 13.00% per
annum.  On September 30, 2002, the  Non-Convertible  Debentures were redeemed in
full,  utilizing  additional  borrowings on the credit  facility and  repurchase
agreements,  resulting  in a  corresponding  redemption  in full of the  related
Non-Convertible  Amount.  In connection  with the  redemption  transaction,  the
Company  expensed the  remaining  unamortized  discount and fees on the redeemed
Non-Convertible  Amount  resulting  in  $586,000 of  additional  expense for the
quarter ended September 30, 2002.

For financial  reporting  purposes,  the Trust is treated as a subsidiary of the
Company  and,  accordingly,  the  accounts  of the  Trust  are  included  in the
consolidated  financial  statements  of the Company.  Intercompany  transactions
between the Trust and the Company,  including the original  convertible  and new
debentures, have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of the
Company.  The  original  Convertible  Trust  Preferred  Securities  and  the new
Convertible  Trust  Preferred  Securities  are  presented as a separate  caption
between  liabilities  and  stockholders'  equity  ("Convertible  Trust Preferred
Securities") in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company.  Distributions on
the original  Convertible  Trust  Preferred  Securities and the new  Convertible
Trust Preferred  Securities are recorded,  net of the tax benefit, in a separate
caption immediately following the provision for income taxes in the consolidated
statements of operations of the Company.

14.  Stockholders' Equity

Authorized Capital

Upon  consummation  of  the  reorganization   (see  Note  1),  each  outstanding
predecessor  class A common share of beneficial  interest was converted into one
share  of  Class A  Common  Stock,  and  each  outstanding  predecessor  class A
preferred  share of beneficial  interest was converted into one share of Class A
Preferred Stock. As a result, all of the predecessor's previously issued class A
common shares have been  reclassified  as shares of Class A Common Stock and all
of the  predecessor's  previously  issued  class A  preferred  shares  had  been
reclassified as shares of Class A Preferred Stock.

The  Company  has the  authority  to issue up to  300,000,000  shares  of stock,
consisting of (i) 100,000,000  shares of Class A Common Stock,  (ii) 100,000,000
shares  of class B common  stock,  par value  $0.01  per share  ("Class B Common
Stock"), and (iii) 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The board of directors
is generally  authorized to issue additional  shares of authorized stock without
stockholders' approval.

14.  Stockholders' Equity, continued

Common Stock

Except as  described  herein or as required by law, all shares of Class A Common
Stock and shares of Class B Common Stock are  identical and entitled to the same
dividend,  distribution,  liquidation and other rights. The Class A Common Stock
are  voting  shares  entitled  to vote  on all  matters  presented  to a vote of
stockholders,  except as provided by law or subject to the voting  rights of any
outstanding  preferred  stock.  The  shares of Class B Common  Stock do not have
voting  rights and are not counted in  determining  the presence of a quorum for
the  transaction of business at any meeting of the  stockholders of the Company.
Holders of record of shares of Class A Common Stock and shares of Class B Common
Stock on the record date fixed by the Company's  board of directors are entitled
to receive such  dividends as may be declared by the board of directors  subject
to the rights of the holders of any outstanding preferred stock.

Each share of Class A Common  Stock is  convertible  at the option of the holder
thereof  into one  share  of  Class B  Common  Stock  and,  subject  to  certain
conditions;  each share of Class B Common Stock is  convertible at the option of
the holder thereof into one share of Class A Common Stock.

Preferred Stock

In  connection  with the  reorganization,  the  Company  created  two classes of
Preferred  Stock,  Class  A  Preferred  Stock  and the  class B 9.5%  cumulative
convertible non-voting preferred stock ("Class B Preferred Stock"). As described
above, upon consummation of the  reorganization,  the predecessor's  outstanding
class A preferred  shares of beneficial  interest were  converted into shares of
Class A Preferred Stock. Following the reorganization, certain shares of Class A
Preferred  Stock  were  converted  into  shares of Class B  Preferred  Stock and
certain  shares of Class A Common  Stock were  converted  into shares of Class B
Common  Stock.  In  December  2001,  following  the  repurchase  of  all  of the
outstanding  shares of Preferred Stock (as discussed below), the Company amended
its charter to eliminate from authorized capital the previously designated Class
A Preferred Stock and Class B Preferred Stock and increase the authorized shares
of preferred stock to 100,000,000.

Common and Preferred Stock Transactions

During March 2000, the Company commenced an open market stock repurchase program
under which the Company was initially authorized to purchase, from time to time,
up  to  2,000,000  shares  of  Class  A  Common  Stock.   Since  that  time  the
authorization  has been  increased  by the board of  directors to purchase up to
7,100,770  shares of Class A Common Stock.  As of December 31, 2002, the Company
had purchased and retired, pursuant to the program,  4,902,470 shares of Class A
Common Stock at an average price of $4.36 per share (including commissions).

The Company has no further obligations to issue additional warrants to Citigroup
at  December  31,  2002.  The  value  of the  warrants  at the  issuance  dates,
$4,636,000, was capitalized and is being amortized over the anticipated lives of
the Funds.  On January 31, 2003,  the Company  purchased all of the  outstanding
warrants to purchase 8,528,467 shares of Class A Common Stock for $2,132,000.

In two  privately  negotiated  transactions  closed in April  2001,  the Company
repurchased for $29,138,000,  630,701 shares of Class A Common Stock,  1,520,831
shares of Class B Common Stock,  1,518,390 shares of Class A Preferred Stock and
2,274,110  shares  of Class B  Preferred  Stock.  In  addition,  in a  privately
negotiated  transaction  closed in August  2001,  the  Company  repurchased  for
$20,896,000, 200,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, 1,234,355 shares of Class B
Common Stock,  759,195 shares of Class A Preferred Stock and 1,769,138 shares of
Class B  Preferred  Stock.  The Company has  repurchased  all of its  previously
outstanding Preferred Stock and eliminated the related dividend.

16.  Income Taxes, continued

The Company has federal net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") as of December
31, 2002 of approximately  $13.9 million.  Such NOLs expire through 2021. Due to
an  ownership  change in January  1997 and another  prior  ownership  change,  a
substantial  portion of the NOLs are limited for federal  income tax purposes to
approximately  $1.4  million  annually.   Any  unused  portion  of  such  annual
limitation  can be  carried  forward to future  periods.  The  Company  also has
federal  capital loss  carryforwards  as of December  31, 2002 of  approximately
$29.4 million that expire in 2007.

Deferred  income  taxes  reflect  the net tax effects of  temporary  differences
between the carrying  amounts of assets and liabilities for financial  reporting
purposes and the amounts used for tax reporting purposes.

As discussed in Note 1, the board of directors has authorized the election to be
taxed as a REIT beginning in 2003.  Management intends to operate the Company in
a manner to meet the qualifications to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes  during the 2003 tax year.  Management does not expect the Company will
be liable  for  income  taxes or taxes on  "built-in  gain" on its assets at the
federal  level or in most states in future  years,  other than on the  Company's
taxable REIT subsidiary.  Accordingly,  the Company eliminated substantially all
of its  deferred  tax  liabilities  other than that  related to its taxable REIT
subsidiary at December 31, 2002.

The components of the net deferred tax assets are as follows (in thousands):

17.  Employee Benefit Plans

Employee 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan

In 1999,  the Company  instituted  a 401(k) and profit  sharing plan that allows
eligible  employees to  contribute  up to 15% of their salary into the plan on a
pre-tax  basis,  subject to annual  limits.  The Company has  committed  to make
contributions  to the plan equal to 3% of all eligible  employees'  compensation
subject  to annual  limits  and may make  additional  contributions  based  upon
earnings.  The Company's  contribution  expense for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, was $110,000, $196,000 and $187,000, respectively.

1997 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan

The  Company's  1997 Amended and Restated  Long-Term  Incentive  Stock Plan (the
"Incentive Stock Plan") permits the grant of nonqualified stock option ("NQSO"),
incentive stock option  ("ISO"),  restricted  stock,  stock  appreciation  right
("SAR"), performance unit, performance stock and stock unit awards. A maximum of
882,896 shares of Class A Common Stock may be issued during the fiscal year 2003
pursuant to awards under the  Incentive  Stock Plan and the Director  Stock Plan
(as defined below) in addition to the shares subject to awards outstanding under
the two plans at December  31,  2002.  The maximum  number of shares that may be
subject  to awards to any  employee  during  the term of the plan may not exceed
1,000,000  shares and the maximum  amount  payable in cash to any employee  with
respect  to  any  performance   period  pursuant  to  any  performance  unit  or
performance stock award is $1.0 million.

The ISOs shall be  exercisable  no more than ten years after their date of grant
and five years after the grant in the case of a 10%  stockholder and vest over a
period of three years with one-third vesting at each anniversary  date.  Payment
of an option may be made with cash, with previously  owned Class A Common Stock,
by foregoing compensation in accordance with performance  compensation committee
or compensation committee rules or by a combination of these.

Restricted  stock may be granted under the Incentive Stock Plan with performance
goals and periods of restriction  as the board of directors may  designate.  The
performance  goals may be based on the  attainment of certain  objective  and/or
subjective  measures.  In 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company issued 75,472 shares,
227,780 shares and 230,304 shares,  respectively,  of restricted  stock.  62,374
shares were  canceled in 2001 and 32,500  shares were  canceled in 2000 upon the
resignation of employees prior to vesting. The shares of restricted stock issued
in 2002  vest  one-third  on each of the  following  dates:  February  1,  2003,
February 1, 2004 and February 1, 2005. The shares of restricted  stock issued in
2001 vest one-third on each of the following dates:  February 1, 2002,  February
1, 2003 and February 1, 2004. The shares of restricted stock issued in 2000 vest
one-third on each of the following dates: February 1, 2001, February 1, 2002 and
February 1, 2003. The Company also granted  52,083 shares of  performance  based
restricted stock in 1999, which were canceled in 2002.

The Incentive  Stock Plan also  authorizes  the grant of stock units at any time
and from  time to time on such  terms as shall  be  determined  by the  board of
directors or administering  compensation committee. Stock units shall be payable
in Class A Common Stock upon the occurrence of certain trigger events. The terms
and  conditions  of the  trigger  events  may vary by stock unit  award,  by the
participant, or both.

At  December  31,  2002,  2001  and  2000,  1,306,987,  1,011,824  and  745,505,
respectively,  of the options  were  exercisable.  At  December  31,  2002,  the
outstanding  options have various remaining  contractual lives ranging from 3.00
to 9.09 years with a weighted average life of 6.54 years.

1997 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan

The  Company's  1997 Amended and  Restated  Long-Term  Director  Stock Plan (the
"Director  Stock  Plan")  permits  the  grant of NQSO,  restricted  stock,  SAR,
performance  unit,  stock and stock unit awards.  A maximum of 882,896 shares of
Class A Common  Stock may be issued  during the  fiscal  year 2002  pursuant  to
awards under the Director  Stock Plan and the Incentive  Stock Plan, in addition
to the shares subject to awards  outstanding under the two plans at December 31,
2002.

The board of directors  shall  determine the purchase price per share of Class A
Common Stock covered by a NQSO granted under the Director Stock Plan. Payment of
a NQSO may be made with cash,  with  previously  owned  shares of Class A Common
Stock,  by  foregoing  compensation  in  accordance  with  board  rules  or by a
combination of these payment methods. SARs may be granted under the plan in lieu
of NQSOs, in addition to NQSOs,  independent of NQSOs or as a combination of the
foregoing.  A holder of a SAR is entitled  upon  exercise  to receive  shares of
Class A  Common  Stock,  or cash or a  combination  of  both,  as the  board  of
directors may determine, equal in value on the date of exercise to the amount by
which the fair market  value of one share of Class A Common Stock on the date of
exercise  exceeds  the  exercise  price  fixed by the board on the date of grant
(which price shall not be less than 100% of the market price of a share of Class
A Common  Stock on the date of  grant)  multiplied  by the  number  of shares in
respect to which the SARs are exercised.

Restricted  stock may be granted under the Director Stock Plan with  performance
goals and periods of restriction  as the board of directors may  designate.  The
performance  goals may be based on the  attainment of certain  objective  and/or
subjective measures.  The Director Stock Plan also authorizes the grant of stock
units at any time and from time to time on such terms as shall be  determined by
the board of directors. Stock units shall be payable in shares of Class A Common
Stock upon the occurrence of certain trigger events. The terms and conditions of
the trigger events may vary by stock unit award, by the participant, or both.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

The Company  complies with the  provisions of the FASB's  Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation" ("SFAS
No.  123").  SFAS No. 123  encourages  the  adoption of a new  fair-value  based
accounting method for employee stock-based compensation plans. SFAS No. 123 also
permits companies to continue  accounting for stock-based  compensation plans as
prescribed  by APB  Opinion  No. 25.  However,  companies  electing  to continue
accounting  for  stock-based  compensation  plans under APB Opinion No. 25, must
make pro  forma  disclosures  as if the  Company  adopted  the cost  recognition
requirements  under SFAS No.  123.  The  Company  has  continued  to account for
stock-based compensation under APB Opinion No. 25. Accordingly,  no compensation
cost has been recognized for the Incentive Stock Plan or the Director Stock Plan
in the accompanying  consolidated statements of operations as the exercise price
of the  stock  options  granted  thereunder  equaled  the  market  price  of the
underlying stock on the date of the grant.

Pro forma information regarding net income and net earnings per common share has
been estimated at the date of the grant using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing
model based on the following assumptions:

                                    2002               2001             2000
                             ----------------   ---------------    -------------
Risk-free interest rate             4.30%              4.75%            6.65%
Volatility                         25.0%              25.0%            40.0%
Dividend yield                      0.0%               0.0%             0.0%
Expected life (years)               5.0                5.0              5.0

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded  options  that have no vesting  restrictions  and are fully
transferable.  In addition,  option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective  assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility.  Because
the  Company's  employee  stock  options  have   characteristics   significantly
different from those of traded  options,  and because  changes in the subjective
input  assumptions  can  materially  affect  the  fair  value  estimate,  in the
Company's  opinion,  the existing models do not  necessarily  provide a reliable
single  measure of the fair value of its employee  stock  options.  The weighted
average fair value of each stock option  granted during the years ended December
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $1.64, $1.47 and $1.58, respectively.

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options
is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The Company's pro
forma information for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 is as
follows (in thousands, except for net earnings (loss) per share of common
stock):

18.  Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The FASB's  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 107,  "Disclosures
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments," ("SFAS No. 107") requires disclosure
of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized
in the statement of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate
that value.  In cases where quoted market prices are not available,  fair values
are based upon  estimates  using  present value or other  valuation  techniques.
Those techniques are significantly  affected by the assumptions used,  including
the discount  rate and the  estimated  future cash flows.  In that  regard,  the
derived  fair  value  estimates   cannot  be   substantiated  by  comparison  to
independent  markets  and,  in many cases,  could not be  realized in  immediate
settlement  of  the  instrument.   SFAS  No.  107  excludes  certain   financial
instruments and all non-financial  instruments from its disclosure requirements.
Accordingly,  the aggregate  fair value amounts do not represent the  underlying
value of the Company.

The following  methods and  assumptions  were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

   Cash and cash  equivalents:  The  carrying  amount  of cash on hand and money
   market funds is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.

   Available-for-sale  securities:  The fair value was determined based upon the
   market value of the securities.

   Commercial  mortgage-backed  securities:  The  fair  value  was  obtained  by
   obtaining quotes from a market maker in the security.

   Loans  receivable,  net:  The fair values  were  estimated  by using  current
   institutional  purchaser  yield  requirements  for loans with similar  credit
   characteristics.

   Interest  rate cap  agreement:  The fair value was  estimated  based upon the
   amount at which similar financial instruments would be valued.

   Credit  facilities:  The credit  facilities are at floating rates of interest
   for which the spread  over LIBOR is at rates that are similar to those in the
   market currently.  Therefore,  the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of
   fair value.

   Repurchase  obligations:  The  repurchase  obligations,  which are  generally
   short-term in nature,  bear interest at a floating rate and the book value is
   a reasonable estimate of fair value.

   Term redeemable securities contract:  The fair value was estimated based upon
   the amount at which similar  privately placed financial  instruments would be
   valued.

   Convertible  Trust Preferred  Securities:  The fair value was estimated based
   upon the amount at which similar privately placed financial instruments would
   be valued.

   Interest rate swap agreements:  The fair values were estimated based upon the
   amount at which similar financial instruments would be valued.

Litigation

In the normal  course of  business,  the  Company  is  subject to various  legal
proceedings and claims, the resolution of which, in management's  opinion,  will
not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or the
results of operations of the Company.

Employment Agreements

The Company has an employment  agreement with its chief  executive  officer that
provided for an initial  five-year term of employment  that ended July 15, 2002.
The agreement has been automatically extended for a one-year renewal term ending
July 15, 2003 and  contains  extension  options  that extend the  agreement  for
additional  one-year terms  automatically  unless  terminated by either party by
April 17, 2003. The employment  agreement  currently  provides for a base annual
salary of  $600,000,  subject to calendar  year cost of living  increases at the
discretion  of the board of  directors.  The  chief  executive  officer  is also
entitled  to annual  incentive  cash  bonuses to be  determined  by the board of
directors based on individual  performance and the  profitability of the Company
and is a participant  in the  Incentive  Stock Plan and other  employee  benefit
plans of the Company.

23.  Risk Factors

The  Company's  assets are  subject to  various  risks that can affect  results,
including  the level and  volatility  of  prevailing  interest  rates and credit
spreads, adverse changes in general economic conditions and real estate markets,
the  deterioration  of credit quality of borrowers and the risks associated with
the ownership and operation of real estate.  Any significant  compression of the
spreads  of the  interest  rates  earned  on  interest-earning  assets  over the
interest  rates  paid on  interest-bearing  liabilities  could  have a  material
adverse effect on the Company's operating results as could adverse  developments
in the  availability  of desirable  loan and  investment  opportunities  and the
ability to obtain and maintain  targeted levels of leverage and borrowing costs.
Adverse changes in national and regional economic conditions,  including acts of
terrorism,  can have an  effect on real  estate  values  increasing  the risk of
undercollateralization  to the extent that the fair market  value of  properties
serving as collateral  security for the Company's  assets are reduced.  Numerous
factors,  such as  adverse  changes  in local  market  conditions,  competition,
increases in  operating  expenses and  uninsured  losses,  can affect a property
owner's ability to maintain or increase revenues to cover operating expenses and
the debt  service  on the  property's  financing  and,  consequently,  lead to a
deterioration  in credit  quality or a loan  default and reduce the value of the
Company's  assets.  In  addition,  the yield to maturity on the  Company's  CMBS
assets are subject to the default and loss experience on the underlying mortgage
loans, as well as by the rate and timing of payments of principal.  If there are
realized  losses on the underlying  loans,  the Company may not recover the full
amount, or possibly,  any of its initial  investment in the affected CMBS asset.
To the extent there are prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans as a result
of  refinancing  at lower  rates,  the  Company's  CMBS  assets  may be  retired
substantially  earlier than their stated  maturities  leading to reinvestment in
lower yielding assets.  There can be no assurance that the Company's assets will
not  experience  any of the  foregoing  risks or that,  as a result  of any such
experience,  the Company will not suffer a reduced  return on  investment  or an
investment loss.

25.  Subsequent Events

In December  2002,  the Company's  board of directors  authorized  the Company's
election to be taxed as a REIT for the 2003 tax year.  The Company will continue
to make, for its own account and as investment  manager for the account of funds
under  management,  loans  and  debt-related  investments  in  various  types of
commercial real estate and related assets.

In view of the Company's election to be taxed as a REIT, the Company will tailor
the its balance  sheet  investment  program to  originate  or acquire  loans and
investments  to  produce a  portfolio  that  meets the  asset and  income  tests
necessary  to  maintain  the  Company's  qualification  as a REIT.  In  order to
accommodate the Company's REIT status,  the legal structure of future investment
funds the Company  sponsors  may be  different  from the legal  structure of the
Company's existing investment funds.

In order to qualify as a REIT,  five or fewer  individuals  may own no more than
50% of the Company's  Common Stock. As a means of  facilitating  compliance with
such  qualification,  stockholders  controlled  by John R.  Klopp  and  Craig M.
Hatkoff  and  trusts  for the  benefit  of the  family of Samuel  Zell each sold
500,000  shares  of  Class A  Common  Stock to an  institutional  investor  in a
transaction  that closed on February 7, 2003.  Following this  transaction,  the
Company's  largest five individual  stockholders  own in the aggregate less than
50% of the Company's Class A Common Stock.

In connection with the organization of Fund I and Fund II and in accordance with
the venture  agreement,  in 2001 and 2002,  the Company  issued to affiliates of
Citigroup a warrant to purchase  8,528,467  shares of Class A Common  Stock.  At
December 31, 2002, all such warrants had a $5.00 per share exercise price,  were
exercisable  and were to expire on March 8, 2005. In January  2003,  the Company
purchased all of the outstanding warrants for $2.1 million.

In January 2003, the Company purchased  Citigroup's 75% interest in Fund I for a
purchase  price of  approximately  $38.4 million  (including  the  assumption of
liabilities).  As  of  January  31,  2003,  the  Company  will  consolidate  the
operations of Fund I in its consolidated financial statements.

On January 31,  2003,  Edward L.  Shugrue III,  the  Company's  chief  financial
officer,  resigned and was replaced by Brian H. Oswald. Prior to his appointment
as chief  financial  officer,  Mr.  Oswald had been the  Company's  director  of
finance and  accounting and chief  accounting  officer since 1997. In connection
with Mr. Shugrue's resignation,  the Company purchased 199,282 shares of Class A
Common Stock from Mr. Shugrue for $947,000.
