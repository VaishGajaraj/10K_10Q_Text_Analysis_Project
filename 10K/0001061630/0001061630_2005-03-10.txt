------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview

We are a  fully  integrated,  self-managed  finance  and  investment  management
company that specializes in credit-sensitive  structured financial products.  To
date,  our investment  programs have focused on loans and  securities  backed by
income-producing  commercial  real estate assets.  From the  commencement of our
finance  business in 1997 through December 31, 2004, we have completed over $4.3
billion of real  estate-related  investments  both directly and on behalf of our
managed funds. We conduct our operations as a real estate  investment  trust, or
REIT, for federal income tax purposes.

Currently,  we make balance sheet  investments  for our own account and manage a
series  of  private  equity  funds on  behalf of  institutional  and  individual
investors.  Since we commenced our investment management business in March 2000,
we have  co-sponsored  three funds:  CT  Mezzanine  Partners I LLC, CT Mezzanine
Partners II LP and CT Mezzanine Partners III, Inc., which we refer to as Fund I,
Fund II and Fund III, respectively.

Developments during Fiscal Year 2004

On May 11, 2004, we closed on the initial tranche of a direct public offering to
designated controlled affiliates of W. R. Berkley Corporation, which we refer to
as Berkley.  We issued  1,310,000  shares of our class A common  stock and stock
purchase  warrants to purchase  365,000 shares of our class A common stock for a
total purchase price of $30.7 million. On June 21, 2004, we closed on the second
tranche of the direct public offering and issued an additional 325,000 shares of
our  class A  common  stock  for a total  purchase  price of $7.6  million.  The
warrants to purchase 365,000 shares of our class A common stock,  which were set
to expire on December 31, 2004, were exercised on September 13, 2004 for a total
purchase price of $8.5 million. Pursuant to a director designation right granted
to  Berkley in the  transaction,  we  appointed  Joshua A. Polan to our board of
directors.

In June and July of 2004, CT  Investment  Management  Co. LLC, our  wholly-owned
investment  management  subsidiary,  was approved as a Special Servicer by Fitch
Ratings,  Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. These approvals allow
CT Investment  Management Co. to act as a named Special  Servicer for CMBS and B
Note investments.  As Special Servicer,  we believe CT Investment Management Co.
will be able to increase the control it has in managing  certain portions of our
portfolio while potentially generating additional fee income.  Approval from the
rating agencies was based upon,  among other things,  our experience in managing
and working out problem assets,  our established  asset management  policies and
procedures  and our technology  systems.  We believe our ability to be a Special
Servicer  improves  the  asset  management  of  our  existing   portfolio,   and
facilitates our plan to increase our CMBS and B Note investment activity.

On July 20,  2004,  we  closed a $320.8  million  issue of  collateralized  debt
obligations,   commonly  known  as  CDOs,   which  were  privately   offered  to
institutional  investors. In connection with the issuance of the CDOs, we closed
on the  following  related  transactions,  which  together  we  call  the  CDO-1
transaction:

     o    we purchased a $251.2  million  portfolio of 40 floating  rate B Notes
          and one mezzanine loan from GMAC Commercial Mortgage Corporation;
     o    we  contributed  those  assets,  along with $72.9  million of B Notes,
          mezzanine  loans and  subordinate  CMBS from our own balance sheet, to
          Capital  Trust  RE CDO  2004-1  Ltd.,  our  consolidated  wholly-owned
          subsidiary that we refer to as CDO-1;
     o    CDO-1  issued  $320.8  million of  floating  rate CDOs  secured by the
          assets contributed to it;
     o    CDO-1 sold all of the $252.8 million of CDOs that are rated investment
          grade to third-party investors; and
     o    we acquired and retained all of the $68.1 million of unrated and below
          investment grade rated CDOs in addition to all of CDO-1's $3.2 million
          of equity.


                                       1
<PAGE>


We  consolidate  CDO-1  into  our  financial   statements,   with  the  entity's
investments  shown as loans  receivable and the  investment  grade notes held by
third-parties  shown as direct  liabilities on our balance sheet. As a result of
the CDO-1 transaction,  our balance sheet assets increased by $251.2 million and
we recorded $252.8 million of CDOs as liabilities at the time of the closing.

The  CDO-1  transaction  provided  us  with a  number  of  significant  benefits
including:

     o    increased our balance sheet interest earning assets by $251.2 million;
     o    created long-term,  non-recourse financing at an all-in borrowing cost
          that is  significantly  lower  than our  pre-existing  sources of debt
          capital;
     o    obtained  long-term,  floating  rate  financing  that matches both the
          interest rate index and duration of our assets;
     o    extended  the  useful  life  of the  financing  through  a  four  year
          reinvestment  period during which principal  proceeds from the initial
          CDO assets can be reinvested in qualifying replacement assets; and
     o    established  us as a CDO  issuer  and  collateral  manager,  which  we
          believe will facilitate our issuance of additional CDOs in the future.

On July 28,  2004,  we closed on a public  offering of our class A common  stock
pursuant to which we sold 1,888,289 shares and certain selling shareholders sold
2,136,711  shares obtained upon the concurrent  conversion of $44,871,000 of our
outstanding  convertible junior  subordinated  debentures.  All of the 4,025,000
shares were sold to the public at a price of $23.75 per share.  After payment of
underwriting  discounts and commissions  and expenses,  we received net proceeds
from the offering of $41.6 million.

On September  29, 2004,  following  our issuance of a notice of redemption to be
effected  on  September  30,  2004,  the  external   holders  of  the  remaining
$44,871,000  principal  amount of our step up  convertible  junior  subordinated
debentures  outstanding  converted the entire  principal amount due thereon into
2,136,711  shares  of  our  class  A  common  stock  at a  conversion  price  of
approximately $21.00 per share.

We have  entered  into a contract to obtain  certain  outsourced  services  from
Global Realty Outsourcing, Inc., which we refer to as GRO, a company in which we
have an equity  investment  and on whose board of directors  our  president  and
chief executive officer serves.  Pursuant to the contract,  GRO provides sixteen
dedicated  employees to assist us in monitoring assets and evaluating  potential
investments, fifteen of whom are located in Chennai, India. GRO began performing
these services for us in April 2004 in advance of concluding  negotiation of the
definitive agreement.

Platform

We are a fully integrated,  self-managed company that has 24 full-time employees
based in New York City. Our senior management team has an average of 19 years of
experience in the fields of real estate,  credit, capital markets and structured
finance. Around this team of professionals, we have developed an entire platform
to originate and manage  portfolios  of  credit-sensitive  structured  products.
Founded on our  long-standing  relationships  with borrowers,  brokers and first
mortgage  providers,   our  extensive   origination  network  produces  multiple
investment  opportunities  from which we select only those  transactions that we
believe exhibit a compelling  risk/return profile. Once a transaction that meets
our parameters is  identified,  we apply a disciplined  process  founded on four
elements:

     o    intense credit underwriting;

     o    creative financial structuring;

     o    efficient use of leverage; and

     o    aggressive asset management.

The first  element,  and the foundation of our past and future  success,  is our
expertise in credit underwriting.  For each prospective investment,  an in-house
underwriting team is assigned to perform a ground-up  analysis of all aspects of
credit risk. Our rigorous  underwriting  process is embodied in our  proprietary
credit  policies


                                       2
<PAGE>


and procedures  that detail the due diligence  steps from initial client contact
through  closing.  Input and  approval is  required  from our  finance,  capital
markets, credit and legal teams, as well as from various third-parties including
our credit providers.

Creative  financial  structuring is the second critical  element in our process.
Based upon our underwriting, we strive to create a customized structure for each
investment  that has the necessary real estate  credit,  interest rate and other
applicable  protections  while  meeting the varying  needs of our  borrowers and
partners.  We believe our  demonstrated  ability to structure  solutions for our
customers gives us a distinct competitive advantage in our market place.

The  prudent  use of leverage  is the third  integral  element of our  platform.
Leverage can increase returns on equity and enhance  portfolio  diversification,
but can also increase risk. We control this financial risk by actively  managing
our capital structure,  seeking to match the duration and interest rate index of
our assets and liabilities and, where appropriate, employing hedging instruments
such as interest rate swaps,  caps and other interest rate exchange  agreements.
Our  objective is to minimize  interest  rate risk and  optimize the  difference
between  the yield on our assets and the cost of our  liabilities  to create net
interest spread. To achieve our objectives,  we pursue innovative debt financing
alternatives,  such as our use of collateralized debt obligations to finance our
balance sheet investments.

The final  element of our  platform is  aggressive  asset  management.  We pride
ourselves  on our active  style of  managing  our  portfolios.  From  closing an
investment  through its final repayment,  our dedicated asset management team is
in constant contact with our borrowers, monitoring performance of the collateral
and  enforcing  our rights as  necessary.  Our  designation  as a rated  Special
Servicer will allow us to exercise more direct  control over certain of our CMBS
and B Note investments.

By adhering to these four key elements that define our platform,  from July 1997
through  December  31,  2004,  we have  originated  over  $4.3  billion  of real
estate-related  investments,  both directly and on behalf of our managed  funds,
and limited the loss experience of our investment portfolios to less than 1.0%.

Business Model

Our business  model is designed to produce a unique mix of net  interest  spread
from our balance sheet investments and fee income from our investment management
operations.  Our goal is to deliver a stable,  growing  stream of earnings  from
these two complementary activities.

Our current balance sheet  investment  program focuses on structured  commercial
real  estate  debt  investments,   including  B  Notes,  subordinate  CMBS,  and
small-balance  (under $15 million) mezzanine loans. As of December 31, 2004, our
interest-earning  balance sheet assets  (excluding  cash,  fund  investments and
other assets)  totaled  $803.9  million and had a  weighted-average  unleveraged
yield of 7.9%. Our  interest-bearing  liabilities as of that date totaled $543.0
million and had a weighted-average interest rate cost of 3.7%.

We currently manage two private equity funds, CT Mezzanine Partners II LP and CT
Mezzanine  Partners  III,  Inc.  Both funds were formed to  specialize in making
large-balance  commercial real estate mezzanine loans. Fund II made $1.2 billion
of investments in 40 separate  transactions  during its  contractual  investment
period that  commenced in April 2001 and ended in April 2003. As of December 31,
2004, Fund II's remaining  investments  aggregate  $131.9 million,  all of which
were  performing.  Fund III held its initial  closing in June 2003 and its final
closing in August  2003,  raising a total of $425  million of  committed  equity
capital.  With  leverage,  we have  the  capacity  to make  over $1  billion  of
investments during Fund III's investment period,  which expires in June of 2005.
Through  December  31,  2004,  Fund III has made  approximately  $800 million of
investments,  of which $602.4  million  remains  outstanding  as of December 31,
2004. We have made  co-investments in Fund II and Fund III, and our wholly-owned
taxable REIT subsidiary,  CT Investment Management Co., serves as the manager to
both funds.  In addition to our pro-rata  share of income as a  co-investor,  we
earn base management  fees and  performance-oriented  incentive  management fees
from each fund. We allocate  commercial real estate investment  opportunities to
Fund III that meet the fund's duration,  size and leveraged  return  parameters.
Our investment  management  activities  are described  further under the caption
"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations".

We operate our  business to qualify as a REIT for federal  income tax  purposes.
Our primary  objective in deciding to elect REIT status was to pay  dividends to
our  shareholders  on  a  tax-efficient  basis.  We  manage  our  balance  sheet
investments  to  produce a  portfolio  that  meets the  asset and  income  tests
necessary  to  maintain  our  REIT   qualification  and  otherwise  conduct  our
investment   management  business  through  our  wholly-owned   subsidiary,   CT
Investment Management Co., which is subject to federal income tax.

Investment Strategies

Since 1997, our investment  programs have focused on various strategies designed
to take  advantage  of  investment  opportunities  that  have  developed  in the
commercial real estate mezzanine  sector.  These investment  opportunities  have
been created largely by the evolution and growing  importance of  securitization
in the real estate capital markets. With approximately $2.1 trillion outstanding
as of 2003, U.S.  commercial real estate debt is a large and dynamic market that
had  traditionally  been  dominated  by  institutional  lenders  such as  banks,
insurance  companies and thrifts  making first  mortgage  loans for retention in
their own portfolios.  Securitized debt has captured an increasing share of this
market,  growing  from less than 5% of the total amount  outstanding  in 1993 to
approximately  18% by year-end  2003.  More  importantly,  according to industry
estimates, CMBS now accounts for roughly 40-50% of annual new originations, with
domestic  CMBS  issuance  in 2004  exceeding  $93  billion.  In  addition,  many
traditional  lenders  have adopted CMBS  standards  in their  portfolio  lending
programs, further extending the influence of securitization in the market.

The essence of securitization is risk segmentation, whereby whole mortgage loans
(or pools of loans) are split into multiple classes and sold to different buyers
based on their risk tolerance and return requirements.  The most senior classes,
which have the lowest risk and therefore the lowest return, are rated investment
grade (AAA through BBB-) by the credit rating agencies. Debt that is subordinate
to these  investment  grade  classes is either  sold as  securities  rated below
investment  grade or outside the  securitized  pools as  individual  property or
portfolio  specific loans. In either case, these  investments are subordinate to
the senior debt but senior to the owner/operator's  common equity investment and
command a higher yield than the senior indebtedness.  These "mezzanine" tranches
may carry sub-investment grade ratings or no rating at all.

Depending on our assessment of relative value,  our real estate  investments may
take a variety of forms including:

     o    Property  Mezzanine Loans -- These are secured property loans that are
          subordinate  to a first  mortgage  loan,  but  senior  to the  owner's
          equity.  A mezzanine loan is evidenced by its own promissory  note and
          is typically made to the owner of the property-owning entity, which is
          typically  the senior  loan  borrower.  It is not secured by the first
          mortgage on the property,  but by a pledge of the mezzanine borrower's
          ownership  interest  in  the   property-owning   entity.   Subject  to
          negotiated  contractual  restrictions,  the  mezzanine  lender has the
          right, following foreclosure, to become the sole indirect owner of the
          property, subject to the lien of the first mortgage.

     o    B Notes -- These are loans  evidenced by a junior  participation  in a
          first   mortgage   against   one  or  more   properties;   the  senior
          participation  is  known  as an A  Note.  Although  a B  Note  may  be
          evidenced by its own promissory  note, it shares a single borrower and
          mortgage with the A Note and is secured by the same collateral. B Note
          lenders have the same  obligations,  collateral  and borrower as the A
          Note lender and in most instances are contractually  limited in rights
          and remedies in the case of a default.  The B Note is  subordinate  to
          the A Note by virtue of a contractual  arrangement  between the A Note
          lender and the B Note lender. For the B Note lender to actively pursue
          a full range of remedies,  it must, in most instances,  purchase the A
          Note.

     o    Subordinate  CMBS -- These commercial  mortgage-backed  securities are
          the junior  classes of  securitized  pools of multiple  first mortgage
          loans.  Cash flows from the  underlying  mortgages are  aggregated and
          allocated to the different  classes in accordance  with their priority
          ranking,  typically  ranging  from the AAA rated  through the unrated,
          first-loss  tranche.  Administration  and  management  of the pool are
          performed by a trustee and servicers, who act on behalf of all holders
          in accordance with contractual  agreements.  Our investments generally
          represent the subordinated tranches ranging from the BBB rated through
          the unrated class.


                                       4

     o    Corporate Mezzanine Loans -- These are investments in or loans to real
          estate-related operating companies,  including REITs. Such investments
          may take the form of secured  debt,  preferred  stock and other hybrid
          instruments such as convertible  debt.  Corporate  mezzanine loans may
          finance,  among other things,  operations,  mergers and  acquisitions,
          management buy-outs, recapitalizations,  start-ups and stock buy-backs
          generally involving real estate and real estate-related entities.

     o    First Mortgage Loans -- These are secured  property loans evidenced by
          a first  mortgage  which is senior to any mezzanine  financing and the
          owner's  equity.  These loans are  typically  bridge  loans for equity
          holders who require interim financing until permanent financing can be
          obtained.  Our first  mortgage  loans are generally not intended to be
          permanent  in nature,  but rather are  intended to be of a  relatively
          short  duration,  with extension  options as deemed  appropriate,  and
          typically  require a balloon payment of principal at maturity.  We may
          also  originate  and fund first  mortgage  loans in which we intend to
          sell the senior tranche, thereby creating a property mezzanine loan.

We  finance  single  properties,  multiple  property  portfolios  and  operating
companies, with our investment typically representing the portion of the capital
structure  ranging  between  40% and 85% of  underlying  collateral  value.  Our
objective is to create  portfolios  which are diversified by investment  format,
property  type and  geographic  market.  The  following  charts  illustrate  the
diversification  achieved  from  July  1997  through  December  31,  2004 in the
origination of our investment portfolios.

If carefully  underwritten  and  structured,  we believe that portfolios of real
estate  mezzanine  investments can produce superior  risk-adjusted  returns when
compared to both senior debt and direct equity ownership.

Business Plan

Our business  strategy is to continue to grow our balance sheet  investments and
our third-party assets under management. We expect the growth of our business to
be driven primarily by the following activities:

     o    we will continue to make commercial real estate mezzanine  investments
          for our balance sheet;

     o    we will expand our investment  management  business through additional
          offerings of  subsequent  pooled  investment  vehicles  such as the CT
          Mezzanine Partners funds; and

     o    we may pursue other balance sheet and investment management businesses
          that  leverage our core skills in credit  underwriting  and  financial
          structuring.

Competition

We are  engaged  in a  highly  competitive  business.  We  compete  for loan and
investment opportunities with numerous public and private real estate investment
vehicles,   including  financial  institutions,   specialty  finance  companies,
mortgage banks, pension funds,  opportunity funds, REITs and other institutional
investors,  as well as individuals.  Many competitors are  significantly  larger
than us, have  well-established  operating histories and may have greater access
to  capital  and  other  resources  and may have  other  advantages  over us. In
addition, the investment management industry is highly competitive and there are
numerous   well-established   competitors   possessing   substantially   greater
financial,  marketing,  personnel and other  resources  than us. We compete with
other  investment  management  companies in  attracting  capital for funds under
management.

Government Regulation

Our  activities,  including  the financing of our  operations,  are subject to a
variety of federal and state regulations. In addition, a majority of states have
ceilings  on  interest  rates  chargeable  to  certain  customers  in  financing
transactions.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004,  we had 24 full-time  employees.  None of our employees
are covered by a collective  bargaining  agreement and management  considers the
relationship with our employees to be good.

Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Governance Documents

We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to all of our
employees, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and
accounting  officer.  This code of  business  conduct  and ethics is designed to
comply with SEC  regulations  and New York Stock Exchange  corporate  governance
rules  related  to codes of conduct  and  ethics and is posted on our  corporate
website at  www.capitaltrust.com.  A copy of our code of  business  conduct  and
ethics is also  available  free of charge,  upon  request  directed  to Investor
Relations, Capital Trust, Inc., 410 Park Avenue, 14th Floor, New York, NY 10022.

Our board of directors created, revised the charter for and/or reconstituted the
membership of the audit, compensation and corporate governance committees of the
board,  effective  immediately following our annual meeting of shareholders that
was convened and held on June 17, 2004. Our corporate governance  guidelines and
the   committee    charters   are   posted   on   our   corporate   website   at
www.capitaltrust.com.

The last  reported  sale  price of the class A common  stock on March 4, 2005 as
reported on the NYSE composite transaction tape was $32.78. As of March 4, 2005,
there were 1,306  holders of record of the class A common  stock.  By  including
persons  holding  shares in broker  accounts  under street  names,  however,  we
estimate our shareholder base to be approximately 2,926 as of March 4, 2005.

No dividends were paid on the class A common stock in 2002. With our decision to
elect to be taxed as a REIT,  we began  paying  dividends  on our class A common
stock in the first quarter of 2003.

We generally  intend to distribute  each year  substantially  all of our taxable
income (which does not necessarily  equal net income as calculated in accordance
with generally  accepted  accounting  principles) to our  shareholders  so as to
comply with the REIT provisions of the Internal  Revenue Code. We intend to make
dividend  distributions  quarterly  and,  if  necessary  for REIT  qualification
purposes,  we may need to  distribute  any taxable  income  remaining  after the
distribution of the final regular  quarterly  dividend each year,  together with
the first regular  quarterly  dividend payment of the following taxable year or,
at our discretion, in a special dividend distributed prior thereto. Our dividend
policy is subject to revision at the  discretion of our board of directors.  All
distributions  will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will
depend on our taxable income, our financial  condition,  our maintenance of REIT
status and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. All dividends
declared in 2003 and 2004 are ordinary income.

We did not repurchase any of our common stock during the year ended December 31,
2004.

Item 6.           Selected Financial Data
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following table sets forth selected consolidated financial data, which was
derived from our historical consolidated financial statements included in our
Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years then ended.

Certain reclassifications have been made to all periods presented to reflect the
application of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46R on
January 1, 2004, following the adoption of which we no longer consolidated CT
Convertible Trust I, the entity which had purchased our junior subordinated
debentures and issued convertible trust common and preferred securities.

We began to conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes for the 2003 fiscal year, and elected REIT status when we filed our
2003 federal tax return on September 15, 2004. This election resulted in a
material reduction of our tax liability for 2004 and 2003. As a result, our
income tax expense and net income after tax for 2004 and 2003 will not be
comparable to our income tax expense and net income after tax for periods prior
to 2003.

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and

Item 7.           Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
                  and Results of Operations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction

We are a  fully  integrated,  self-managed  finance  and  investment  management
company that specializes in credit-sensitive  structured financial products.  To
date,  our investment  programs have focused on loans and  securities  backed by
income-producing  commercial  real estate assets.  From the  commencement of our
finance  business in 1997 through December 31, 2004, we have completed over $4.3
billion of real  estate-related  investments  both directly and on behalf of our
managed funds. We conduct our operations as a real estate  investment  trust, or
REIT, for federal income tax purposes.

Currently,  we make balance sheet  investments  for our own account and manage a
series  of  private  equity  funds on  behalf of  institutional  and  individual
investors.  Since we commenced our investment management business in March 2000,
we have  co-sponsored  three funds:  CT  Mezzanine  Partners I LLC, CT Mezzanine
Partners II LP and CT Mezzanine Partners III, Inc., which we refer to as Fund I,
Fund II and Fund III, respectively.

Balance Sheet Overview

At December  31, 2003,  we had four  investments  in Federal Home Loan  Mortgage
Corporation  Gold securities with a face value of $19,146,000.  These securities
were sold during the second  quarter of 2004  resulting in a gain of $300,000 to
their amortized cost.

We held 19  investments  in 14  separate  issues of  commercial  mortgage-backed
securities  with an aggregate face value of  $271,757,000  at December 31, 2004.
During the year ended December 31, 2004, we purchased four  investments in three
separate issues of commercial  mortgage-backed  securities. The securities had a
face value of  $61,293,000  and were  purchased at a discount  for  $59,551,000.
During the year ended December 31, 2004, we received full satisfaction of one of
the issues purchased in 2003 for $5,000,000 and received  amortization  payments
of $48,000 on one of the issues  purchased in 2004.  Commercial  mortgage-backed
securities  with a face value of  $61,245,000  earn interest at a variable rate,
which averages the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 2.28% (4.67% at
December  31,  2004).  The  remaining  commercial  mortgage-backed   securities,
$210,512,000  face value,  earn interest at fixed rates  averaging  7.65% of the
face value. We purchased the commercial mortgage-backed securities at discounts.
As of December 31, 2004, the remaining discount to be amortized into income over
the remaining  lives of the  securities was  $22,338,000.  At December 31, 2004,
with discount  amortization,  the  commercial  mortgage-backed  securities  earn
interest  at a  blended  rate of 8.58% of the face  value  less the  unamortized
discount.  As of December 31, 2004, the securities were carried at fair value of
$247,765,000, reflecting a $3,621,000 unrealized gain to their amortized cost.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, we purchased or originated six property
mezzanine  loans  for  $77,282,000  and 63 B Notes  for  $412,420,000,  received
partial repayments on 34 loans totaling $18,215,000 and one mortgage loan, three
property  mezzanine loan and 12 B Notes totaling  $98,207,000 were satisfied and
repaid.  We have no  outstanding  loan  commitments  at December  31,  2004.  At
December 31, 2004, we had outstanding  loans receivable  totaling  approximately
$556.2 million.

At December 31,  2004,  we had 67  performing  loans  receivable  with a current
carrying value of  $553,126,000.  Three of the loans totaling  $80,729,000  bear
interest at an average fixed rate of interest of 10.37%. The 64 remaining loans,
totaling  $473,928,000,  bear interest at a variable rate of interest  averaging
LIBOR plus 4.91% (7.32% at December 31, 2004). One mortgage loan receivable with
an original  principal  balance of $8,000,000  reached maturity on July 15, 2001
and has not been repaid with  respect to  principal  and  interest.  In December
2002, the loan was written down to $4,000,000  through a charge to the allowance
for possible credit losses.  Since the write-down,  we have received proceeds of
$962,000  reducing the carrying value of the loan to  $3,038,000.  In accordance
with our policy for revenue  recognition,  income recognition has been suspended
on this loan and for the year ended


                                       10
<PAGE>


December 31, 2004,  $930,000 of potential interest income has not been recorded.
All other loans are performing in accordance with their terms.

At December 31, 2004,  we had  investments  in Funds of  $21,376,000,  including
$4,901,000  of  unamortized  costs  that were  capitalized  in  connection  with
entering into our venture agreement with Citigroup  Alternative  Investments LLC
and the  commencement of the related fund management  business.  These costs are
being  amortized  over the lives of the Funds and the venture  agreement and are
reflected as a reduction in income/(loss) from equity investments in Funds.

We utilize  borrowings under a committed credit facility,  along with repurchase
obligations,  to finance our  balance  sheet  assets and we  utilized  CDOs as a
source of  financing  for the first  time in 2004 in  connection  with the CDO-1
transaction.

At December 31, 2004, we had  $65,176,000  of outstanding  borrowings  under our
$150.0 million credit facility, with $5.8 million of the remaining $84.8 million
of  available  credit  available  to be  borrowed  without  the  need to  pledge
additional  collateral assets. The credit facility provides for advances to fund
lender-approved  loans and investments  made by us.  Borrowings under the credit
facility  are  secured  by pledges of assets  owned by us and bear  interest  at
specified  spreads over LIBOR,  which spreads vary based upon the perceived risk
of the  pledged  assets.  The  credit  facility  provides  for  margin  calls on
asset-specific  borrowings  in the event of asset  quality  and/or  market value
deterioration  as  determined  under the credit  facility.  The credit  facility
contains customary representations and warranties,  covenants and conditions and
events of default.  Based upon  borrowings  in place at December 31,  2004,  the
effective  interest  rate on the credit  facility was LIBOR plus 1.74% (4.02% at
December 31,  2004).  As of December 31, 2004,  we had  unamortized  capitalized
costs of  $474,000  that are  being  amortized  over the  remaining  life of the
facility  (6.5 months at December 31,  2004).  After  amortizing  these costs to
interest  expense,  the all-in  effective  borrowing  cost on the facility as of
December 31, 2004 was 5.37% based upon the amount  currently  outstanding on the
credit facility.

At December  31,  2003,  we had  borrowed  $11,651,000  under a $75 million term
redeemable securities contract. This term redeemable securities contract expired
on  February  28, 2004 and was repaid by  refinancing  the  previously  financed
assets under the credit facility.

On August 17, 2004,  we entered into a  repurchase  obligation  with an existing
counterparty, pursuant to the terms of a master repurchase agreement that allows
us to incur $50.0 million of repurchase  obligations to finance specific assets.
At December 31, 2004,  the master  repurchase  agreement was utilized to finance
nine loans.  At  December  31,  2004,  we have sold loans with a book and market
value of  $32,215,000  and have a  liability  to  repurchase  these  assets  for
$20,424,000.  The master repurchase  agreement  terminates on September 1, 2007,
and bears interest at specified  rates over LIBOR based upon each asset included
in the obligation.

At December 31, 2004, we are obligated to three  counterparties under repurchase
agreements and have sold loans with a book and market value of $341,993,000  and
have a  liability  to  repurchase  these  assets  for  $225,091,000.  Based upon
advances in place at December  31,  2004,  the  blended  rate on the  repurchase
obligations is LIBOR plus 1.02% (3.32% at December 31, 2004). We had unamortized
capitalized costs of $316,000 as of December 31, 2004, which are being amortized
over the remaining lives of the repurchase  obligations.  After amortizing these
costs to interest  expense based upon the amount  currently  outstanding  on the
repurchase  obligations,  the all-in effective  borrowing cost on the repurchase
obligations  as of  December  31,  2004 was  3.41%.  We expect to enter into new
repurchase  obligations at their  maturity or settle the repurchase  obligations
with the proceeds from the repayment of the underlying financed asset.

On July 20, 2004,  CDO-1 issued six tranches of investment grade rated CDOs with
a  principal  amount  of  $252,778,000  to third  party  investors  in the CDO-1
transaction described under "Item 1 - Business - Developments during Fiscal Year
2004" above. We purchased  through a wholly-owned  subsidiary the four remaining
tranches  of  unrated  and below  investment  grade  rated  CDOs and the  equity
interests  issued by CDO-1.  CDO-1 holds assets,  consisting of loans,  CMBS and
cash totaling  $324,074,000,  which serves as collateral  for the CDOs.  The six
investment grade tranches were issued with floating rate coupons with a combined
weighted  average  rate of LIBOR + 0.62% (3.03% at December 31, 2004) and have a
remaining  expected  life of 4.5 years as of  December  31,  2004.  We  incurred
$5,508,000 of issuance costs which will be amortized on a level yield basis over
the average  life of CDO-1.  CDO-1 was  structured  to match fund the


                                       11
<PAGE>


cash  flows from a  significant  portion of our  existing  and newly  acquired B
notes, mezzanine loans and CMBS. For accounting purposes,  CDO-1 is consolidated
in our financial statements.  The six investment grade tranches are treated as a
secured financing, and are non-recourse to us.

Proceeds from the sale of the six investment grade tranches issued by CDO-1 were
used to purchase a $251.2 million  portfolio of B notes and mezzanine loans from
a third party which were  contributed  to and  pledged as  collateral  to secure
repayment of the CDOs. The $72.9 million  remaining assets pledged as collateral
were contributed from our existing portfolio of loans and CMBS.

We were party to four cash flow interest rate swaps with a total  notional value
of $134  million as of December 31, 2004.  These cash flow  interest  rate swaps
effectively  convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt, which is utilized to
finance  assets that earn  interest at fixed  rates.  We receive a rate equal to
LIBOR (2.30% at December 31, 2004) and pay an average rate of 4.15%.  The market
value of the swaps at December  31, 2004 was  $194,000,  which is recorded as an
interest rate hedge asset and as a component of accumulated other  comprehensive
gain/(loss) on our balance sheet.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued  Interpretation
No. 46,  "Consolidation  of Variable  Interest  Entities," an  interpretation of
Accounting  Research  Bulletin 51.  Interpretation  No. 46 provides  guidance on
identifying  entities  for which  control is achieved  through  means other than
through voting rights,  and how to determine when and which business  enterprise
should  consolidate a variable interest entity. In addition,  Interpretation No.
46 requires that both the primary  beneficiary and all other  enterprises with a
significant  variable  interest in a variable  interest  entity make  additional
disclosures.   The  transitional  disclosure  requirements  took  effect  almost
immediately and are required for all financial statements initially issued after
January 31, 2003. In December 2003,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board
issued a revision of Interpretation  No. 46,  Interpretation No. 46R, to clarify
the provisions of Interpretation  No. 46. The application of Interpretation  No.
46R is effective for public companies,  other than small business issuers, after
March 15, 2004. We have evaluated all of our  investments and other interests in
entities that may be deemed variable  interest  entities under the provisions of
Interpretation No. 46 and have concluded that no additional  entities need to be
consolidated.

In  evaluating  Interpretation  No.  46R, we  concluded  that we could no longer
consolidate CT  Convertible  Trust I, the entity which had purchased our step up
convertible  junior  subordinated   debentures  and  issued   company-obligated,
mandatory  redeemable,  convertible  trust common and preferred  securities.  In
1998,  we had issued the  convertible  junior  subordinated  debentures  and had
purchased the  convertible  trust common  securities.  The  consolidation  of CT
Convertible  Trust I resulted in the elimination of both the convertible  junior
subordinated  debentures and the  convertible  trust common  securities with the
convertible trust preferred securities being reported on our balance sheet after
liabilities  but before  equity and the related  expense  being  reported on the
income  statement  below income taxes and net of income tax benefits.  After the
deconsolidation,  we reported the convertible junior subordinated  debentures as
liabilities and the  convertible  trust common  securities as other assets.  The
expense from the payment of interest on the  debentures was reported as interest
and related  expenses on  convertible  junior  subordinated  debentures  and the
income  received from our investment in the common  securities was reported as a
component  of interest  and related  income.  We have  elected to restate  prior
periods for the application of Interpretation  46R. The restatement was effected
by a cumulative  type change in accounting  principle on January 1, 2002.  There
was no change to previously reported net income as a result of such restatement.

As of December 31, 2004, the entire  $92,524,000  aggregate  principal amount of
our convertible junior subordinated  debentures outstanding at December 31, 2003
had been  redeemed  or  converted  into class A common  stock.  Certain  holders
converted  $44,871,000  of the principal  amount due on the  convertible  junior
subordinated debentures in connection with the closing of our public offering of
class A common stock on July 28,  2004.  On September  29, 2004,  following  our
issuance of a notice of redemption to be effected on September 30, 2004, holders
of  $44,871,000   principal  amount  of  the  convertible  junior   subordinated
debentures outstanding converted the principal amount due thereon into 2,136,711
shares of our class A common stock at a conversion price of approximately $21.00
per share.  The remaining  $2,982,000  of the  convertible  junior  subordinated
debentures  outstanding were repaid to the Trust and then the Trust redeemed the
common securities held by us.

In 2000, we announced an open market share repurchase program under which we may
purchase,  from time to time, up to 666,667  shares of our class A common stock.
Since that time the  authorization  has been


                                       12
<PAGE>


increased  by the board of directors  to purchase  cumulatively  up to 2,366,923
shares of class A common  stock.  In December  31,  2004 we had  666,339  shares
remaining authorized for repurchase under the program. We did not repurchase any
of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2004.

At December  31,  2004,  we had  15,052,262  shares of our class A common  stock
outstanding.

Investment Management Overview

We  operated  principally  as a balance  sheet  investor  until the start of our
investment management business in March 2000 when we entered into a venture with
affiliates of Citigroup Alternative Investments to co-sponsor and invest capital
in a series of commercial real estate mezzanine  investment funds managed by us.
Pursuant to the venture agreement, we have co-sponsored Fund I, Fund II and Fund
III. We have  capitalized  costs of  $4,901,000,  net, from the formation of the
venture and the Funds that are being  amortized  over the remaining  anticipated
lives of the Funds and the related venture agreement.

Fund I commenced  its  investment  operations  in May 2000 with  equity  capital
supplied solely by Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  (75%) and us (25%). From
May 11,  2000 to April 8,  2001,  the  investment  period  for the fund,  Fund I
completed $330 million of total  investments in 12 transactions.  On January 31,
2003,  we  purchased  the  interest  in  Fund  I  held  by an  affiliate  of our
co-sponsor,  Citigroup Alternative  Investments LLC, and began consolidating the
operations of Fund I in our consolidated financial statements.

Fund II had its initial  closing on equity  commitments on April 9, 2001 and its
final  closing on August 7, 2001,  ultimately  raising  $845.2  million of total
equity  commitments,  including  $49.7 million (5.9%) from us and $198.9 million
(23.5%) from  Citigroup  Alternative  Investments.  Third-party  private  equity
investors,  including  public and  corporate  pension  plans,  endowment  funds,
financial  institutions and high net worth individuals,  made the balance of the
equity  commitments.  During its two-year  investment  period,  which expired on
April 9, 2003, Fund II invested $1.2 billion in 40 separate  transactions.  Fund
II  utilizes  leverage  to  increase  its  return  on  equity,   with  a  target
debt-to-equity  ratio of 2:1. Total capital calls during the  investment  period
were $329.0 million. CT Investment  Management Co. LLC, our wholly-owned taxable
REIT subsidiary,  acts as the investment manager to Fund II and receives 100% of
the base  management  fees paid by the fund. As of April 9, 2003, the end of the
Fund II investment  period,  CT Investment  Management  Co. began earning annual
base  management  fees of  1.287%  of  invested  capital.  Based  upon Fund II's
invested  capital at December 31, 2004, the date upon which the  calculation for
the next  quarter  is  based,  CT  Investment  Management  Co.  will  earn  base
management fees of $181,000 for the quarter ending March 31, 2005.

We and Citigroup  Alternative  Investments,  through our collective ownership of
the general partner, are also entitled to receive incentive management fees from
Fund II if the return on invested  equity is in excess of 10% after all invested
capital  has been  returned.  The Fund II  incentive  management  fees are split
equally between Citigroup Alternative Investments and us. We will pay 25% of our
share  of  the  Fund  II  incentive   management  fees  as  long-term  incentive
compensation  to our  employees.  No such  incentive  fees have  been  earned at
December 31, 2004 and as such, no amount of such potential fees has been accrued
as income in our  financial  statements.  The  amount  of  incentive  fees to be
received in the future will depend upon a number of factors, including the level
of interest rates and the fund's  ability to generate  returns in excess of 10%,
which is in turn impacted by the duration and ultimate performance of the fund's
assets.  Potential incentive fees received as Fund II winds down could result in
significant  additional  income from  operations in certain periods during which
such  payments  can be  recorded  as income.  If Fund II's  assets were sold and
liabilities  were settled on January 1, 2005 at the recorded book value, and the
fund's equity and income were distributed,  we would record  approximately  $9.5
million of gross incentive fees.

We do not anticipate  making any additional  equity  contributions to Fund II or
its general  partner.  Our net investment in Fund II and its general  partner at
December 31, 2004 was $5.5  million.  As of December  31,  2004,  Fund II had 10
outstanding  loans and investments  totaling  $131.9 million,  all of which were
performing in accordance with the terms of their agreements.

On June 2, 2003, Fund III effected its initial closing on equity commitments and
on August 8,  2003,  its final  closing,  raising a total of $425.0  million  in
equity commitments. Our equity commitment was $20.0 million (4.7%) and Citigroup
Alternative  Investments' equity commitment was $80.0 million (18.8%),  with the
balance made by third-party  private equity investors.  From the initial closing
through December 31, 2004,


                                       13
<PAGE>


we have made equity investments in Fund III of $11,260,000. Through December 31,
2004, Fund III had made loans and investments of approximately  $800 million and
as of December 31, 2004, Fund III had nineteen outstanding loans and investments
totaling  $602.4  million,  all of which were  performing in accordance with the
terms of their agreements.

CT Investment Management Co. receives 100% of the base management fees from Fund
III  calculated at a rate equal to 1.42% per annum of committed  capital  during
Fund III's two-year investment period,  which expires June 2, 2005, and 1.42% of
invested  capital  thereafter.  Based  upon Fund III's  $425.0  million of total
equity  commitments,   CT  Investment  Management  Co.  will  earn  annual  base
management  fees  of $6.0  million  during  the  investment  period.  We and our
co-sponsor are also entitled to receive incentive  management fees from Fund III
if the return on invested equity is in excess of 10% after all invested  capital
has been returned.  We will receive 62.5% and our co-sponsor  will receive 37.5%
of the total  incentive  management  fees.  We will  distribute a portion of our
share  (up to  40%) of the  Fund  III  incentive  management  fees as  long-term
incentive compensation to our employees.

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

We reported net income of  $21,976,000  for the year ended December 31, 2004, an
increase of  $8,451,000  from the net income of  $13,525,000  for the year ended
December 31, 2003.  These  increases were primarily the result of an increase in
net  interest  income  from  loans and  other  investments.  In 2004,  we raised
significant new capital,  increased interest earning assets by $442 million, and
financed our  business  more  efficiently  through the CDO-1  transaction.  As a
result,  debt costs as a  percentage  of  interest  income have  decreased.  The
significance of the more efficient  financing is further  demonstrated when $2.8
million of prepayment penalties which were collected in 2003 are eliminated from
interest income for comparison purposes.

Interest  and  related  income  from  loans and other  investments  amounted  to
$46,561,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $8,037,000 from
the  $38,524,000   amount  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2003.   Average
interest-earning assets increased from approximately $359.5 million for the year
ended  December  31,  2003 to  approximately  $552.9  million for the year ended
December 31, 2004.  The average  interest  rate earned on such assets  decreased
from  10.7% for the year  ended  December  31,  2003 to 8.4% for the year  ended
December 31, 2004.  During the year ended December 31, 2003, we recognized  $2.8
million in  additional  income on the early  repayment  of loans.  Without  this
additional  interest  income,  the average  earning rate for the 2003 year would
have been 9.9%.  The decrease in rates that occurred was due to the repayment of
two fixed rates loans (which earned interest at rates in excess of the portfolio
average),  a change in the mix of our investment portfolio to include lower risk
B Notes in 2004 (which  generally  carry  lower  interest  rates than  mezzanine
loans) and a general  decrease in spreads  being  obtained  on newly  originated
investments, partially offset by a higher average LIBOR rate, which increased by
0.3% to 1.5% for the 2004 year.

We utilize our existing credit  facility,  collateralized  debt  obligations and
repurchase obligations to finance our interest-earning assets.

Interest and related  expenses on secured debt amounted to  $13,724,000  for the
year ended  December 31, 2004,  an increase of  $3,879,000  from the  $9,845,000
amount for the year ended  December 31, 2003. The increase in expense was due to
an increase in the amount of average  interest-bearing  liabilities  outstanding
from  approximately  $193.8  million  for the year ended  December  31,  2003 to
approximately  $333.5  million  for the year ended  December  31,  2004,  offset
partially by a decrease in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities
from 5.1% to 4.1% for the same  periods.  The  decrease in the  average  rate is
substantially  due to the use of  collateralized  debt  obligations to finance a
large portion of the portfolio at lower rates than the credit  facility and term
redeemable  securities  contract,  partially  offset by the  increase in average
LIBOR.

We also utilized the convertible junior  subordinated  debentures to finance our
interest-earning  assets.  During the year ended  December 31, 2004 and 2003, we
recognized $6,417,000 and $9,730,000,  respectively,  of expenses related to the
convertible  junior  subordinated  debentures.  The  decrease  results  from the
conversion of one half of the principal amount due on the debentures into common
stock on July 28,  2004 and the  conversion  of the  remaining  debentures  into
common stock on September 29, 2004.

Other revenues increased  $1,049,000 from $9,599,000 for the year ended December
31, 2003 to  $10,648,000  for the year ended  December 31, 2004. The increase is
primarily due to the receipt of management  fees from Fund III for the full year
in 2004 as compared to the receipt of fees for only part of the year in 2003, as
Fund III  commenced  its  investment  period in June  2003.  The  increase  also
resulted from an increase in earnings from our equity investment in Fund III and
the recognition of a $300,000 gain on the sale of available-for-sale securities.
This was partially offset by a decrease in the management fees from Fund II, due
to lower levels of investment in 2004 as the fund winds down.

General and administrative  expenses increased $1,909,000 to $15,229,000 for the
year ended  December 31, 2004 from  $13,320,000  for the year ended December 31,
2003. The increase in general and  administrative  expenses was primarily due to
increases in employee compensation and benefits,  internal control documentation
and testing costs in excess of $500,000,  and additional expenses related to the
services provided under the GRO contract, offset by reduced legal costs.

On at least a quarterly basis,  management  reevaluates the reserve for possible
credit  losses  based  upon our  current  portfolio  of loans.  Each loan in our
portfolio is evaluated  using our  proprietary  loan risk rating  system,  which
considers  loan  to  value,  debt  yield,   cash  flow  stability,   exit  plan,
sponsorship,  loan  structure  and any other  factors  necessary  to assess  the
likelihood of  delinquency  or default.  If we believe that there is a potential
for  delinquency  or default,  a downside  analysis is prepared to estimate  the
value  of the  collateral  underlying  our  loan,  and  this  potential  loss is
multiplied  by the  likelihood  of default.  Based upon our  detailed  review at
December 31, 2004, we concluded that a reserve for possible credit losses was no
longer warranted and the reserve was recaptured.

Our CMBS investments are carried as available for sale, and are therefore valued
at their estimated fair value with net unrealized  gains or losses reported as a
component of accumulated  other  comprehensive  income/(loss)  in  shareholders'
equity,  unless an other than  temporary  impairment is deemed to have occurred.
During the fourth  quarter of 2004,  changes in our expected cash flow on two of
our CMBS  investments  resulted in our  concluding  that these CMBS had incurred
other than temporary  impairment  and as a result,  we recorded a charge of $5.9
million through the income statement to record these  investments at the current
market value.  We expect a full recovery from our other  securities  and did not
recognize any other than temporary impairment on the remaining CMBS investments.

We have  made an  election  to be taxed as a REIT  under  Section  856(c) of the
Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,  commencing with the tax year ending
December 31, 2003.  As a REIT,  we generally  are not subject to federal  income
tax. To maintain qualification as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of our
REIT taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain other requirements.  If
we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable  year, we will be subject to federal
income tax on our  taxable  income at regular  corporate  rates.  We may also be
subject to certain  state and local  taxes on our  income  and  property.  Under
certain  circumstances,  federal  income  and  excise  taxes  may  be due on our
undistributed taxable income.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we were in compliance with all REIT  requirements
and,  as such,  have not  provided  for income tax  expense on our REIT  taxable
income for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. We also have taxable REIT
subsidiaries  which are subject to tax at regular  corporate  rates.  During the
year  ended  December  31,  2004,  we  recorded a  $451,000  income tax  benefit
resulting  from losses  generated by our taxable REIT  subsidiaries.  During the
year ended  December  31, 2003,  we recorded  $646,000 of income tax expense for
income that was earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002

We reported net income of  $13,525,000  for the year ended December 31, 2003, an
increase  of  $23,263,000  from the net loss of  $9,738,000  for the year  ended
December  31,  2002.   This   increase  was  primarily  the  result  of  certain
transactions in 2002 which reduced net income, including the settlement of three
cash flow hedges resulting in a $6.7 million charge to earnings,  the write-down
of  deferred  tax assets as a result of our  decision  to elect REIT  status for
2003,  the  write-down  of a loan in  Fund I which  caused  a loss  from  equity
investments in funds and the inability to utilize  capital  losses  generated in
2002 to reduce current taxes.  Also  contributing  to the increase in net income
was the  reduction  in income taxes in 2003 in  connection  with our decision to
elect REIT status.  These increases were partially  offset by a recapture of the
allowance for possible credit losses in 2002.

Interest  and  related  income  from  loans and other  investments  amounted  to
$38,246,000  for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of $8,833,000 from
the  $47,079,000   amount  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2002.   Average
interest-earning assets decreased from approximately $473.7 million for the year
ended  December  31,  2002 to  approximately  $356.8  million for the year ended
December 31, 2003.  The average  interest  rate earned on such assets  increased
from 9.9% in 2002 to 10.7% in 2003.  During the year ended December 31, 2003 and
December  31,  2002,  the Company  recognized  $2.8  million  and $1.6  million,
respectively,  in  additional  income  on  the  early  repayment  of  loans  and
investments.  Without this additional  interest income, the earning rate for the
2003 period  would have been 9.9% versus 9.6% for the 2002  period.  LIBOR rates
averaged  1.2% for the year ended  December 31, 2003 and 1.8% for the year ended
December 31, 2002,  a decrease of 0.6%.  The portion of our average  assets that
earn interest at fixed rates did not decrease proportionately to the decrease in
assets that earn interest at variable rates in 2003,  which served to offset the
decrease in earnings from the decrease in the average LIBOR rate.

Interest and related expenses amounted to $9,845,000 for the year ended December
31,  2003, a decrease of  $8,124,000  from the  $17,969,000  amount for the year
ended  December 31,  2002.  The decrease in expense was due to a decrease in the
amount of average  interest-bearing  liabilities  outstanding from approximately
$260.0  million for the year ended  December  31, 2002 to  approximately  $193.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2003, and a decrease in the average rate
on  interest-bearing  liabilities  from 6.9% to 5.1% for the same  periods.  The
decrease in the average rate is substantially due to the decrease in swap levels
and rates and the  increased  use of  repurchase  agreements  as a percentage of
total debt in the 2003 period at lower spreads to LIBOR than the credit facility
utilized in the 2002 period.

During the year ended  December 31, 2003 and 2002, we recognized  $9,730,000 and
$16,192,000,  respectively,  of net expenses  related to our outstanding step up
convertible   junior   subordinated   debentures.   This  amount   consisted  of
distributions to the holders totaling $9,252,000 and $14,887,000,  respectively,
and  amortization  of discount  and  origination  costs  totaling  $478,000  and
$1,305,000,  respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. The
decrease in the distribution amount and amortization of discount and origination
costs resulted from the elimination of the  distributions  and discount and fees
on the  non-convertible  amount of the convertible  trust preferred  securities,
which was redeemed on September 30, 2002.

Other revenues  decreased  $325,000 from  $9,924,000 for the year ended December
31, 2002 to $9,599,000  for the year ended  December 31, 2003.  In 2002,  Fund I
increased its allowance for possible  credit losses by  establishing  a specific
reserve for the single non-performing loan it was carrying. The loss from equity
investments  in Funds during the year ended  December 31, 2002 was primarily due
to this additional expense. On January 31, 2003, we purchased from affiliates of
Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  their  75%  interest  in  Fund I and  began
consolidating the operations of Fund I in our consolidated financial statements,
which further reduced  earnings from equity  investments in Funds. On January 1,
2003,  the general  partner of Fund II (owned by  affiliates of us and Citigroup
Alternative  Investments) voluntarily reduced by 50% the management fees charged
to  Fund II for the  remainder  of the  investment  period  due to a lower  than
expected  level of  deployment  of the  Fund's  capital.  This,  along  with the
reduction in income when we began charging  management fees on invested  capital
for Fund II,  partially  offset  by the  management  fees  charged  to Fund III,
reduced our  management  and  advisory  fees from Funds by $2.1  million for the
period.  Also in 2002,  we earned a $2.0  million  fee from our  final  advisory
assignment.

General and  administrative  expenses  decreased $676,000 to $13,320,000 for the
year ended  December 31, 2003 from  $13,996,000  for the year ended December 31,
2002. The decrease in general and  administrative  expenses was primarily due to
reduced employee compensation. We employed an average of 25 employees during the
year ended December 31, 2003 and 27 during the year ended December 31, 2002.

During the year  ended  December  31,  2002,  we  recaptured  $4,713,000  of our
previously  established  allowance for possible  credit  losses.  We deemed this
recapture necessary due to the substantial reduction in the loan portfolio and a
general  reduction in the default risk of the loans remaining based upon current
conditions.

At December 31, 2003, we were in compliance  with all REIT  requirements  and as
such,  only provided for income tax expense on taxable income  attributed to our
taxable REIT subsidiaries in 2003.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At December  31,  2004,  we had  $24,583,000  in cash.  Our  primary  sources of
liquidity  for  2005  are  expected  to be cash on  hand,  cash  generated  from
operations,  principal and interest  payments received on loans and investments,
and  additional  borrowings  under  our  credit  facility,  CDOs and  repurchase
obligations.  We also believe  these sources of capital will be adequate to meet
future cash  requirements  in 2005.  We expect that during  2005,  we will use a
significant  amount  of our  available  capital  resources  to  satisfy  capital
contributions  required  pursuant to our equity  commitments  to Fund III and to
originate or purchase new loans and investments for our balance sheet. We intend
to continue to employ leverage on our balance sheet assets to enhance our return
on equity.

We  experienced  a net  increase  in cash of  $15,845,000  during the year ended
December 31,  2004,  compared to a net  decrease of  $1,448,000  during the year
ended December 31, 2003. Cash provided by operating  activities  during the year
ended December 31, 2004 was $19,580,000, compared to $15,802,000 during the same
period of 2003.  For the year ended  December 31,  2004,  cash used in investing
activities was $416,707,000,  compared to $5,716,000 of cash provided during the
same period in 2003. The change was primarily due to our new loan and investment
activity  totaling  $549.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a large
percentage  of which came from our  purchase of a $251.2  million  portfolio  of
loans from GMAC  Commercial  Mortgage  Corporation in connection  with the CDO-1
transaction.  We financed the new investment activity with additional borrowings
under our credit  facility,  repurchase  obligations  and the CDOs issued in the
CDO-1  transaction.  This,  along with the cash  received  from our direct share
placement  to Berkley  and the public  offering  of shares we closed on July 28,
2004,  accounted  for  substantially  all of the change in the net cash activity
from financing activities.

During  the  investment  periods  for Fund I and Fund II, we  generally  did not
originate or acquire loans or commercial mortgage-backed securities directly for
our own balance sheet  portfolio.  When the Fund II investment  period ended, we
began  originating  loans  and  investments  for our own  account  that were not
targeted for investment by Fund III. We expect to use available  working capital
to make contributions to Fund III or any other funds sponsored by us as and when
required by the equity commitments made by us to such funds.

At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of
$65,176,000,  collateralized  debt  obligations of $252,778,000  and outstanding
repurchase obligations totaling $225,091,000.  The terms of these agreements are
described  above under the caption  "Balance  Sheet  Overview".  At December 31,
2004, we had pledged assets that enable us to borrow an additional  $5.9 million
and had  unpledged  assets of $74.3  million,  which when pledged will  generate
approximately  $55 million of  additional  liquidity.  We had $235.5  million of
credit available for the financing of new and existing unpledged assets pursuant
to these sources of financing.  Additional liquidity will be created when assets
that are currently  pledged as collateral for the credit facility and repurchase
obligations  are pledged to existing and newly issued CDOs, as the percentage of
collateral value that can be financed,  or advance rates,  pursuant to the CDO's
are generally higher.

     (1)  Fund III's  investment  period continues until June 2005 at which time
          our equity  commitment  to the fund  expires.  While we do not believe
          that all of the equity commitment will be called, we have presented it
          if all of the commitment is called prior to the expiration.

     (2)  We are also  subject  to  interest  rate  swaps  for  which we can not
          estimate future payments due.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Impact of Inflation

Our  operating  results  depend in part on the  difference  between the interest
income earned on our  interest-earning  assets and the interest expense incurred
in  connection  with our  interest-bearing  liabilities.  Changes in the general
level of interest rates  prevailing in the economy in response to changes in the
rate of  inflation or  otherwise  can affect our income by affecting  the spread
between our interest-earning  assets and interest-bearing  liabilities,  as well
as, among other things, the value of our interest-earning assets and our ability
to  realize  gains  from  the  sale  of  assets  and  the  average  life  of our
interest-earning  assets.  Interest rates are highly  sensitive to many factors,
including  governmental  monetary and tax policies,  domestic and  international
economic and political considerations,  and other factors beyond our control. We
employ the use of correlated  hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes
in interest rates on our operations,  including  engaging in interest rate swaps
and interest  rate caps to minimize  our exposure to changes in interest  rates.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the
foregoing risks or that we will ultimately  realize an economic benefit from any
hedging contract into which we enter.

Critical Accounting Policies

Changes in management judgment,  estimates and assumptions could have a material
effect on our consolidated  financial statements.  Management has the obligation
to ensure that its policies and  methodologies  are in accordance with generally
accepted accounting  principles.  During 2004, management reviewed and evaluated
its  critical  accounting  policies  and believes  them to be  appropriate.  Our
accounting  policies  are  described  in  Note 5 to our  consolidated  financial
statements.  The  following  is a summary  of our  accounting  policies  that we
believe  are  the  most   affected  by  management   judgments,   estimates  and
assumptions:

Securities Available-for-sale

We have designated our investments in commercial  mortgage-backed securities and
certain other securities as  available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale  securities
are  carried at  estimated  fair value with the net  unrealized  gains or losses
reported as a component of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income/(loss)  in
shareholders'  equity.  Many of these  investments  are relatively  illiquid and
management  must estimate their values.  In making these  estimates,  management
utilizes market prices provided by dealers who make markets in these securities,
but  may,  under  certain  circumstances,   adjust  these  valuations  based  on
management's  judgment.  Changes in the  valuations  do not affect our  reported
income or cash flows, but impact  shareholders'  equity and,  accordingly,  book
value per share.

We account for CMBS under  Emerging  Issues Task Force  99-20,  "Recognition  of
Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in
Securitized  Financial  Assets".  Under Emerging  Issues Task Force 99-20,  when
significant  changes in  estimated  cash  flows  from the cash flows  previously
estimated  occur due to actual  prepayment  and credit loss  experience  and the
present value of the revised cash flows using the current expected yield is less
than the  present  value  of the  previously  estimated  remaining  cash  flows,
adjusted   for   cash   receipts    during   the    intervening    period,    an
other-than-temporary  impairment is deemed to have  occurred.  Accordingly,  the
security is written down to fair value with the resulting  change being included
in income and a new cost basis established with the original discount or premium
written  off when the new cost basis is  established.  In  accordance  with this
guidance, on a quarterly basis, when significant changes in estimated cash flows
from the cash flows  previously  estimated  occur due to actual  prepayment  and
credit  loss  experience,  we  calculate  a revised  yield  based on the current
amortized cost of the investment, including any other-than-temporary impairments
recognized  to date,  and the  revised  cash flows.  The  revised  yield is then
applied prospectively to recognize interest income.

Management must also assess whether  unrealized  losses on securities  reflect a
decline in value  that is other  than  temporary,  and,  accordingly,  write the
impaired security down to its fair value, through a charge to earnings.  We have
assessed our  securities  to first  determine  whether there is an indication of
possible other than temporary  impairment and then where an indication exists to
determine  if other than  temporary  impairment  did in fact exist.  Significant
judgment of management is required in this  analysis that  includes,  but is not
limited to, making assumptions regarding the collectibility of the principal and
interest, net of related expenses, on the underlying loans.

Income on these available-for-sale  securities is recognized based upon a number
of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies.  Examples of
these include,  among other things,  the rate and timing of principal  payments,
including prepayments,  repurchases, defaults and liquidations, the pass-through
or coupon rate and  interest  rate  fluctuations.  Additional  factors  that may
affect our reported interest income on our  mortgage-backed  securities  include
interest  payment  shortfalls due to  delinquencies  on the underlying  mortgage
loans and the  timing  and  magnitude  of credit  losses on the  mortgage  loans
underlying the securities that are a result of the general condition of the real
estate  market,  including  competition  for  tenants and their  related  credit
quality,   and  changes  in  market  rental  rates.   These   uncertainties  and
contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may
alter the assumptions.

Loans Receivable and Provision for Loan Losses

We purchase and originate  commercial mortgage and mezzanine loans to be held as
long-term  investments at amortized cost.  Management must periodically evaluate
each of these loans for possible impairment.  Impairment is indicated when it is
deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to
the  contractual  terms of the loan. If a loan were determined to be permanently
impaired,  we would  write  down the loan  through a charge to the  reserve  for
possible  credit  losses.  Given  the  nature  of our  loan  portfolio  and  the
underlying commercial real estate collateral, significant judgment of management
is required in determining  permanent impairment and the resulting charge to the
reserve,  which includes but is not limited to making assumptions  regarding the
value of the real estate that secures the mortgage loan.

Our accounting policies require that an allowance for estimated credit losses be
reflected in our  financial  statements  based upon an  evaluation  of known and
inherent  risks in our  mortgage  and  mezzanine  loans.  Quarterly,  management
reevaluates  the  reserve  for  possible  credit  losses  based upon our current
portfolio of loans.  Each loan in our portfolio is evaluated using our loan risk
rating system which  considers loan to value,  debt yield,  cash flow stability,
exit plan, loans sponsorship, the loan structure and any other factors necessary
to assess the loans  likelihood of  delinquency  or default.  If we believe that
there is a potential for delinquency or default, a downside analysis is prepared
to estimate the value of the collateral  underlying our loan, and this potential
loss is multiplied  by the default  likelihood.  Actual  losses,  if any,  could
ultimately differ from these estimates.

detailed review of the entire portfolio


                                       19
<PAGE>


was  completed at December  31, 2004 and certain  loans that we  previously  had
specific  concerns about were either repaid or the  conditions  which caused the
concern were eliminated. Based upon the changes in conditions of these loans and
the evaluations completed on the remainder of the portfolio, we concluded that a
reserve for possible  credit losses was no longer  warranted and the reserve was
recaptured.

Revenue Recognition

Interest income for our loans and investments is recognized over the life of the
investment  using the effective  interest  method and  recognized on the accrual
basis.

Fees received in connection with loan commitments,  net of direct expenses,  are
deferred until the loan is advanced and are then recognized over the term of the
loan as an  adjustment  to yield.  Fees on  commitments  that expire  unused are
recognized at expiration.  Exit fees are also recognized over the estimated term
of the loan as an adjustment to yield.  Purchased  discounts for credit  quality
are amortized  over the  estimated  term of the loan as an adjustment to yields.
Cash flows received in excess of original estimates are recognized prospectively
as an adjustment to yield.

Income recognition is generally suspended for loans at the earlier of the date
at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in the opinion of management,
a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful. Income recognition is
resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is
demonstrated to be resumed.

Fees from investment  management  services and special  servicing are recognized
when earned on an accrual basis.  Fees from  professional  advisory services are
generally  recognized  at the  point  at which  all of our  services  have  been
performed and no significant  contingencies exist with respect to entitlement to
payment.  Fees from asset  management  services are  recognized  as services are
rendered.

We  account  for  incentive  fees we can  potentially  earn  from  the  Funds in
accordance with Method 1 of Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-96.  Under Method
1, no incentive income is recorded until all contingencies have been eliminated.
Method 1 is the  preferred  method as it eliminates  the potential  that revenue
will be  recognized in one quarter and reversed in a future  quarter.  Incentive
income received prior to that date is recorded as unearned income (a liability).
No incentive  fees have been earned at December 31, 2004 and as such,  no amount
of such potential  fees has been accrued as income in our financial  statements.
The amount of  incentive  fees to be  received  in the future will depend upon a
number of factors,  including the level of interest rates and the fund's ability
to generate  returns in excess of 10%, which is in turn impacted by the duration
and ultimate performance of the fund's assets. Potential incentive fees received
as Fund II winds  down  could  result  in  significant  additional  income  from
operations  in certain  periods  during  which such  payments can be recorded as
income. If Fund II's assets were sold and liabilities were settled on January 1,
2005 at the  recorded  book  value,  and  the  fund's  equity  and  income  were
distributed, we would record approximately $9.5 million of gross incentive fees.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

We comply with the  provisions of the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board's
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation".  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 123 encourages
the  adoption  of  a  new  fair-value  based  accounting   method  for  employee
stock-based  compensation plans. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123 also permits companies to continue  accounting for stock-based  compensation
plans as  prescribed  by Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25.  However,
companies  electing to continue  accounting for stock-based  compensation  plans
under  Accounting   Principles  Board  Opinion  No.  25,  must  make  pro  forma
disclosures as if they adopted the cost recognition requirements under Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123.

Through December 31, 2003, we continued to account for stock-based  compensation
under Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Accordingly,  no compensation
cost has been  recognized  for the years  ended  December  31, 2003 and 2002 for
awards  under our stock plans in the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of
operations as the exercise price of the stock options granted thereunder equaled
the market price of the  underlying  stock on the date of the grant.  During the
fourth  quarter  of 2004,  we  elected  to  adopt  the  fair  value  recognition
provisions  of  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 123 using


                                       20
<PAGE>


the modified  prospective  method provided in Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 148,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation - Transition and
Disclosure".  Under the modified  prospective method, we recognized  stock-based
employee compensation costs based upon the fair value recognition  provisions of
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 123 effective January 1, 2004.
Compensation  expense is recognized on the accelerated  attribution method under
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 28.

Risk Management and Financial Instruments

We utilize  derivative  financial  instruments  as a means to help to manage our
interest rate risk exposure on a portion of our variable rate debt  obligations,
through the use of cash flow hedges.  The  instruments  utilized  are  generally
either pay-fixed swaps or LIBOR-based  interest rate caps, which are widely used
in the industry and typically  entered into with major  financial  institutions.
Our accounting  policies generally reflect these instruments at their fair value
with  unrealized   changes  in  fair  value  reflected  in  "Accumulated   other
comprehensive  income" on our consolidated  balance sheets.  Realized effects on
cash flows are generally recognized currently in income.

Income Taxes

Our financial results generally do not reflect provisions for current or
deferred income taxes on our REIT taxable income. Management believes that we
have and intend to continue to operate in a manner that will continue to allow
us to be taxed as a REIT and, as a result, do not expect to pay substantial
corporate-level taxes, other than taxes payable by our taxable REIT
subsidiaries. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and
complex. If we were to fail to meet these requirements, we would be subject to
Federal income tax.

New Accounting Standard

On December 16, 2004, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),  "Share-Based Payment", which is a
revision of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 123 and supersedes
APB  Opinion  No. 25.  SFAS No.  123(R)  requires  all  share-based  payments to
employees,  including  grants of employee  stock  options,  to be valued at fair
value on the date of  grant,  and to be  expensed  over the  applicable  vesting
period.  Pro forma  disclosure of the income  statement  effects of  share-based
payments  is  no  longer  an  alternative.  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 123(R) is effective for all stock-based awards granted on or after
July 1, 2005. In addition,  companies must also recognize  compensation  expense
related  to any  awards  that are not  fully  vested as of the  effective  date.
Compensation  expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair
value  of  the  awards  previously   calculated  in  developing  the  pro  forma
disclosures  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards  No.  123.  As we  have  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards No. No. 123  effective  January 1, 2004, we do not believe
that adoption of SFAS 123(R) will have a material impact on our future financial
results.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The principal objective of our asset/liability management activities is to
maximize net interest income, while minimizing levels of interest rate risk. Net
interest income and interest expense are subject to the risk of interest rate
fluctuations. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we use
interest rate swaps to effectively convert variable rate liabilities to fixed
rate liabilities for proper matching with fixed rate assets. Each derivative
used as a hedge is matched with an asset or liability with which it has a high
correlation. The swap agreements are generally held-to-maturity and we do not
use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We use interest rate
swaps to effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt for the
financed portion of fixed rate assets. The differential to be paid or received
on these agreements is recognized as an adjustment to the interest expense
related to debt and is recognized on the accrual basis.

Our loans and investments, including our fund investments, are also subject to
credit risk. The ultimate performance and value of our loans and investments
depends upon the owner's ability to operate the properties that serve as our
collateral so that they produce cash flows adequate to pay interest and
principal due to us. To monitor this risk, our asset management team is in
constant contact with our borrowers, monitoring performance of the collateral
and enforcing our rights as necessary.

The following table provides information about our financial instruments that
are sensitive to changes in interest rates at December 31, 2004. For financial
assets and debt obligations, the table presents cash flows to the expected
maturity and weighted average interest rates based upon the current carrying
values. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and
weighted average fixed pay and variable receive interest rates by contractual
maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash
flows to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted average variable rates are
based on rates in effect as of the reporting date.

               REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
               FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING


The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Capital Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries

We  have  audited   management's   assessment,   included  in  the  accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial  Reporting,  that Capital
Trust,  Inc. and  Subsidiaries  (the "Company")  maintained  effective  internal
control over  financial  reporting  as of December  31, 2004,  based on criteria
established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring  Organizations  of the Treadway  Commission (the COSO criteria).  The
Company's  management is responsible for maintaining  effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's  assessment  and an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted  our audit in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether  effective
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all  material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting,  evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other  procedures as we considered  necessary in the  circumstances.  We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's  internal control over financial  reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting
and the preparation of financial  statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial  reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the  maintenance  of records that, in reasonable  detail,  accurately and fairly
reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of the assets of the company;  (2)
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use, or  disposition  of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion,  management's  assessment that the Company maintained  effective
internal  control over  financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004,  is fairly
stated,  in all material  respects,  based on the COSO  criteria.  Also,  in our
opinion,  the Company maintained,  in all material respects,  effective internal
control over  financial  reporting  as of December  31, 2004,  based on the COSO
criteria.

We also have  audited,  in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting  Oversight Board (United States),  the consolidated balance sheets of
the Company as of December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated  statements of
operations,  shareholders'  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended  December 31, 2004 of the Company and our report dated March 9,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

                  MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
                              FINANCIAL REPORTING


Management is responsible for  establishing  and maintaining  adequate  internal
control over  financial  reporting,  and for  performing  an  assessment  of the
effectiveness  of internal  control over financial  reporting as of December 31,
2004. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the
preparation  of financial  statements for external  purposes in accordance  with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  The  Company's  system of internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the  transactions  and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company;  and (iii) provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or
timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

All  internal  control  systems,  no matter  how well  designed,  have  inherent
limitations.  Therefore,  even those  systems  determined  to be  effective  can
provide  only   reasonable   assurance  with  respect  to  financial   statement
preparation and presentation.

Management  performed  an  assessment  of the  effectiveness  of  the  Company's
internal  control  over  financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004 based upon
criteria in Internal  Control - Integrated  Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring  Organizations  of the  Treadway  Commission  ("COSO").  Based on our
assessment,  management  determined  that the  Company's  internal  control over
financial  reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004 based on the criteria
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

Our  management's  assessment of the  effectiveness  of the  Company's  internal
control  over  financial  reporting  as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent  registered  public accounting firm, as stated
in their report which appears herein.

                     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
                                ACCOUNTING FIRM




The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Capital Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Capital Trust,
Inc. and Subsidiaries  (the "Company") as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
related  consolidated  statements of operations,  shareholders'  equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December  31,  2004.  Our
audits also included the  financial  statement  schedule  listed in the Index to
Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules.  These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the consolidated  financial  position of the Company at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31,
2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered
in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements,  in 2004 the Company changed
its method of accounting for stock based compensation.

As discussed in Note 3 to the  consolidated  financial  statements,  in 2004 the
Company adopted Financial  Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (R),
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51."

We also have  audited,  in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting  Oversight Board (United States),  the effectiveness of the Company's
internal  control over  financial  reporting  as of December 31, 2004,  based on
criteria  established  in Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated March 9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

                      Capital Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                        December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002

1.  Organization

cReferences  herein to "we," "us" or "our" refer to Capital Trust,  Inc. and its
subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.

We  are  a  finance  and  investment  management  company  that  specializes  in
originating and managing credit sensitive structured financial products. We will
continue to make, for our own account and as investment  manager for the account
of funds under management,  loans and debt-related  investments in various types
of commercial real estate assets and operating companies.

On April 2, 2003, our charter was amended and restated and then further  amended
to eliminate  from our  authorized  stock the entire  100,000,000  shares of our
authorized  but unissued  class B common stock and to effect a one (1) for three
(3) reverse stock split of our class A common stock. Fractional shares resulting
from the reverse stock split were settled in cash at a rate of $16.65 multiplied
by the percentage of a share owned after the split.

All per share  information  concerning  the  computation  of earnings per share,
dividends per share,  authorized  stock,  and per share  conversion and exercise
prices reported in the accompanying  consolidated  interim financial  statements
and these notes to  consolidated  financial  statements have been adjusted as if
the  amendments  to our charter were in effect for all fiscal  periods and as of
all balance sheet dates presented.

2.  REIT Election

In December 2002, our board of directors  authorized our election to be taxed as
a real estate  investment  trust  ("REIT")  beginning with the 2003 tax year. We
will  continue to make,  for our own account and as  investment  manager for the
account  of  funds  under  management,  credit  sensitive  structured  financial
products  including  loans and  debt-related  investments  in  various  types of
commercial real estate.

In view of our  election  to be taxed as a REIT,  we have  tailored  our balance
sheet  investment  program to  originate  or acquire  loans and  investments  to
produce a portfolio that meets the asset and income tests  necessary to maintain
qualification  as a REIT.  In order to  accommodate  our REIT status,  the legal
structure of future  investment funds we sponsor may be different from the legal
structure of our existing investment funds.

In order to qualify as a REIT,  five or fewer  individuals  may own no more than
50% of our  common  stock.  As a means  of  facilitating  compliance  with  such
qualification, shareholders controlled by John R. Klopp and Craig M. Hatkoff and
trusts for the benefit of the family of Samuel Zell each sold 166,666  shares of
class A common stock to an  institutional  investor in a transaction that closed
on February 7, 2003.  Following this  transaction,  our largest five  individual
shareholders own in the aggregate less than 50% of the class A common stock.

3.  Application of New Accounting Standard

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued  Interpretation
No. 46,  "Consolidation  of Variable  Interest  Entities," an  interpretation of
Accounting  Research  Bulletin 51.  Interpretation  No. 46 provides  guidance on
identifying  entities  for which  control is achieved  through  means other than
through voting rights,  and how to determine when and which business  enterprise
should  consolidate a variable interest entity. In addition,  Interpretation No.
46 requires that both the primary  beneficiary and all other  enterprises with a
significant  variable  interest in a variable  interest  entity make  additional
disclosures.   The  transitional  disclosure  requirements  took  effect  almost
immediately and are required for all financial statements initially issued after
January 31, 2003. In December 2003,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board
issued a revision of Interpretation  No. 46,  Interpretation No. 46R, to clarify
the provisions of Interpretation  No. 46. The application of Interpretation  No.
46R is effective for public companies,  other than small business issuers, after
March 15, 2004. We have evaluated all of our  investments and other interests in
entities that may be deemed variable  interest  entities under the provisions of
Interpretation No. 46 and have concluded that no additional  entities need to be
consolidated.

              Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued



3.  Application of New Accounting Standard, continued

In  evaluating  Interpretation  No.  46R, we  concluded  that we could no longer
consolidate CT  Convertible  Trust I, the entity which had purchased our step up
convertible  junior  subordinated   debentures  and  issued   company-obligated,
mandatory redeemable, convertible trust common and preferred securities. Capital
Trust, Inc. had issued the convertible  junior  subordinated  debentures and had
purchased the  convertible  trust common  securities.  The  consolidation  of CT
Convertible  Trust I resulted in the elimination of both the convertible  junior
subordinated  debentures and the  convertible  trust common  securities with the
convertible trust preferred securities being reported on our balance sheet after
liabilities  but before  equity and the related  expense  being  reported on the
income  statement  below income taxes and net of income tax benefits.  After the
deconsolidation,  we report the convertible  junior  subordinated  debentures as
liabilities and the  convertible  trust common  securities as other assets.  The
expense from the payment of interest on the  debentures  is reported as interest
and related  expenses on  convertible  junior  subordinated  debentures  and the
income  received from our  investment in the common  securities is reported as a
component  of interest  and related  income.  We have  elected to restate  prior
periods for the application of Interpretation  46R. The restatement was effected
by a cumulative  type change in accounting  principle on January 1, 2002.  There
was no change to previously reported net income as a result of such restatement.

4.  Venture with Citigroup Alternative Investments LLC

On March 8,  2000,  we  entered  into a venture  with  affiliates  of  Citigroup
Alternative  Investments LLC pursuant to which they agreed,  among other things,
to co-sponsor and invest capital in a series of commercial real estate mezzanine
investment funds managed by us with certain investment criteria. Pursuant to the
venture agreement,  which was amended in 2003, we have co-sponsored three funds;
CT  Mezzanine  Partners I LLC,  CT  Mezzanine  Partners  II LP and CT  Mezzanine
Partners  III,  Inc.,  which  we  refer  to as Fund I,  Fund  II and  Fund  III,
respectively.  Our wholly-owned  subsidiary,  CT Investment Management Co., LLC,
serves as the exclusive investment manager to Fund I, Fund II and Fund III.

Fund  I was  formed  in  March  2000.  An  affiliate  of  Citigroup  Alternative
Investments and our wholly-owned  subsidiary,  as members thereof,  made capital
commitments  of up to $150  million and $50  million,  respectively.  During its
investment period,  Fund I made  approximately  $330 million of investments.  In
January  2003,  we purchased  the 75% interest in Fund I held by an affiliate of
Citigroup  Alternative  Investments for a purchase price of approximately  $38.4
million  (including the assumption of  liabilities),  equal to the book value of
the fund.  On January 31, 2003,  we began  consolidating  the balance  sheet and
operations of Fund I in our consolidated financial statements.

Fund II was  formed  in April  2001.  Fund II  effected  its  final  closing  on
third-party investor equity commitments in August 2001. Fund II had total equity
commitments  of $845.2  million  including  $49.7  million made by us and $198.9
million made by affiliates  of Citigroup  Alternative  Investments.  Third-party
private  equity  investors  made the remaining  equity  commitments.  During its
investment period (April 9, 2001 to April 9, 2003),  Fund II made  approximately
$1.2 billion of investments.

Fund III was  formed  in June  2003.  Fund III  effected  its final  closing  on
third-party  investor  equity  commitments  in August  2003.  Fund III has total
equity  commitments  of $425  million  including  $20 million made by us and $80
million made by affiliates  of Citigroup  Alternative  Investments.  Third-party
private equity investors made the remaining equity commitments. Through December
31, 2004, Fund III made approximately $800 million of investments.

In connection  with entering into the venture  agreement and formation of Fund I
and Fund II,  we issued  to  affiliates  of  Citigroup  Alternative  Investments
warrants to purchase  2,842,822 shares of our class A common stock. The warrants
had a $15.00 per share exercise price and were  exercisable  until expiration on
March 10, 2005.  We  capitalized  the value of the warrants at issuance and they
are being amortized over the anticipated lives of the Funds. In January 2003, we
purchased all of the  outstanding  warrants for $2.1 million.  We had no further
obligations to issue additional warrants to Citigroup at December 31, 2004.

5.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated  financial  statements include our accounts and the accounts of
our  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  CT Investment  Management Co. (as described in
Note 3),  CT-F1,  LLC (direct  member and equity  owner of Fund I), CT Mezzanine
Partners  I LLC,  CT-F2-LP,  LLC  (limited  partner of Fund II),  CT-F2-GP,  LLC
(direct  member and equity owner of Fund II GP),  CT-BB Funding  Corp.  (finance
subsidiary for three mezzanine loans), CT LF Funding Corp.  (finance  subsidiary
for all of our CMBS  securities),  Capital  Trust RE CDO 2004-1  LTD  (issuer of
floating rate CDO  securities),  CT RE CDO 2004-1 Sub LLC  (purchaser of unrated
and  non-investment  grade securities of CDO) and VIC, Inc., which together with
us wholly owns Victor Capital Group, L.P. All significant  intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition

Interest income for our loans and investments is recognized over the life of the
investment  using the effective  interest  method and  recognized on the accrual
basis.

Fees received in connection with loan commitments,  net of direct expenses,  are
deferred until the loan is advanced and are then recognized over the term of the
loan as an  adjustment  to yield.  Fees on  commitments  that expire  unused are
recognized at expiration.  Exit fees are also recognized over the estimated term
of the loan as an adjustment to yield.  Purchased  discounts for credit  quality
are amortized  over the  estimated  term of the loan as an adjustment to yields.
Cash flows received in excess of original estimates are recognized prospectively
as an adjustment to yield.

Income  recognition is generally  suspended for loans at the earlier of the date
at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in the opinion of management,
a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful.  Income recognition is
resumed  when  the  loan  becomes   contractually  current  and  performance  is
demonstrated to be resumed.

Fees from investment  management  services and special  servicing are recognized
when earned on an accrual basis.  Fees from  professional  advisory services are
generally  recognized  at the  point  at which  all of our  services  have  been
performed and no significant  contingencies exist with respect to entitlement to
payment.  Fees from asset  management  services are  recognized  as services are
rendered.

We  account  for  incentive  fees we can  potentially  earn  from  the  Funds in
accordance with Method 1 of Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-96.  Under Method
1, no incentive income is recorded until all contingencies have been eliminated.
Method 1 is the  preferred  method as it eliminates  the potential  that revenue
will be  recognized in one quarter and reversed in a future  quarter.  Incentive
income received prior to that date is recorded as unearned income (a liability).
No incentive  fees have been earned at December 31, 2004 and as such,  no amount
of such potential  fees has been accrued as income in our financial  statements.
The amount of  incentive  fees to be  received  in the future will depend upon a
number of factors,  including the level of interest rates and the fund's ability
to generate  returns in excess of 10%, which is in turn impacted by the duration
and ultimate performance of the fund's assets. Potential incentive fees received
as Fund II winds  down  could  result  in  significant  additional  income  from
operations  in certain  periods  during  which such  payments can be recorded as
income. If Fund II's assets were sold and liabilities were settled on January 1,
2005 at the  recorded  book  value,  and  the  fund's  equity  and  income  were
distributed, we would record approximately $9.5 million of gross incentive fees.

5.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We classify highly liquid  investments with original  maturities of three months
or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents.  At December 31, 2004 and
2003,  a  majority  of the cash  and cash  equivalents  consisted  of  overnight
investments in commercial  paper. We had no bank balances in excess of federally
insured  amounts at December  31,  2004 and 2003.  We have not  experienced  any
losses on our demand deposits, commercial paper or money market investments.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash is $611,000 on deposit with the trustee for CDO-1,  representing
the proceeds of loan repayments which will be used to purchase replacement loans
(either from third parties or us) as collateral for the CDO.

Available-for-Sale Securities and Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities ("CMBS")

We have designated our investments in commercial  mortgage-backed securities and
certain other securities as  available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale  securities
are  carried at  estimated  fair value with the net  unrealized  gains or losses
reported as a component of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income/(loss)  in
shareholders'  equity.  Many of these  investments  are relatively  illiquid and
management  must estimate their values.  In making these  estimates,  management
utilizes market prices provided by dealers who make markets in these securities,
but  may,  under  certain  circumstances,   adjust  these  valuations  based  on
management's  judgment.  Changes in the  valuations  do not affect our  reported
income or cash flows, but impact  shareholders'  equity and,  accordingly,  book
value per share.

We account for CMBS under Emerging Issues Task Force 99-20, "Recognition of
Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in
Securitized Financial Assets". Under Emerging Issues Task Force 99-20, when
significant changes in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously
estimated occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience and the
present value of the revised cash flows using the current expected yield is less
than the present value of the previously estimated remaining cash flows,
adjusted for cash receipts during the intervening period, an
other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred. Accordingly, the
security is written down to fair value with the resulting change being included
in income and a new cost basis established with the original discount or premium
written off when the new cost basis is established. In accordance with this
guidance, on a quarterly basis, when significant changes in estimated cash flows
from the cash flows previously estimated occur due to actual prepayment and
credit loss experience, we calculate a revised yield based on the current
amortized cost of the investment, including any other-than-temporary impairments
recognized to date, and the revised cash flows. The revised yield is then
applied prospectively to recognize interest income.

Management must also assess whether  unrealized  losses on securities  reflect a
decline in value  that is other  than  temporary,  and,  accordingly,  write the
impaired security down to its fair value, through a charge to earnings.  We have
assessed our  securities  to first  determine  whether there is an indication of
possible other than temporary  impairment and then where an indication exists to
determine  if other than  temporary  impairment  did in fact  exist.  During the
fourth  quarter  of 2004,  we  concluded  that two of our CMBS  investments  had
incurred  other  than  temporary  impairment  and we  incurred  a charge of $5.9
million through the income statement.  With respect to the remaining securities,
we believe there has not been any adverse change in cash flows since  inception,
therefore  we did not  recognize  any other  than  temporary  impairment  on the
remaining CMBS  investments.  Significant  judgment of management is required in
this analysis that includes, but is not limited to, making assumptions regarding
the  collectibility of the principal and interest,  net of related expenses,  on
the underlying loans.

5.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

Income on these available-for-sale  securities is recognized based upon a number
of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies.  Examples of
these include,  among other things,  the rate and timing of principal  payments,
including prepayments,  repurchases, defaults and liquidations, the pass-through
or coupon rate and  interest  rate  fluctuations.  Additional  factors  that may
affect our reported interest income on our  mortgage-backed  securities  include
interest  payment  shortfalls due to  delinquencies  on the underlying  mortgage
loans and the  timing  and  magnitude  of credit  losses on the  mortgage  loans
underlying the securities that are a result of the general condition of the real
estate  market,  including  competition  for  tenants and their  related  credit
quality,   and  changes  in  market  rental  rates.   These   uncertainties  and
contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may
alter the assumptions.

Loans Receivable and Reserve for Possible Credit Losses

We purchase and originate  commercial mortgage and mezzanine loans to be held as
long-term  investments at amortized cost.  Management must periodically evaluate
each of these loans for possible impairment.  Impairment is indicated when it is
deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to
the  contractual  terms of the loan. If a loan were determined to be permanently
impaired,  we would  write  down the loan  through a charge to the  reserve  for
possible  credit  losses.  Given  the  nature  of our  loan  portfolio  and  the
underlying commercial real estate collateral, significant judgment of management
is required in determining  permanent impairment and the resulting charge to the
reserve,  which includes but is not limited to making assumptions  regarding the
value of the real estate that secures the mortgage loan.

Our accounting policies require that an allowance for estimated credit losses be
reflected in our financial statements based upon an evaluation of known and
inherent risks in our mortgage and mezzanine loans. Quarterly, management
reevaluates the reserve for possible credit losses based upon our current
portfolio of loans. Each loan in our portfolio is evaluated using our loan risk
rating system which considers loan to value, debt yield, cash flow stability,
exit plan, loans sponsorship, the loan structure and any other factors necessary
to assess the loans likelihood of delinquency or default. If we believe that
there is a potential for delinquency or default, a downside analysis is prepared
to estimate the value of the collateral underlying our loan, and this potential
loss is multiplied by the default likelihood. Actual losses, if any, could
ultimately differ from these estimates.

Equity  investments  in Fund I, Fund II, CT MP II LLC (which we refer to as Fund
II GP) and Fund III (which together we refer to as Funds)

As the Funds are not majority  owned or controlled by us, we do not  consolidate
the Funds in our consolidated financial statements.  We account for our interest
in the Funds on the equity method of accounting. As such, we report a percentage
of the earnings of the Funds equal to our ownership  percentage on a single line
item  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  operations  as  income  from  equity
investments in the Funds.

Equipment and Leasehold Improvements, Net

Equipment  and  leasehold  improvements,  net, are stated at original  cost less
accumulated  depreciation and  amortization.  Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line  method based on the estimated  lives of the  depreciable  assets.
Amortization is computed over the remaining terms of the related leases.

Expenditures  for maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense at the
time incurred.  Expenditures  determined to represent  additions and betterments
are  capitalized.  Cost of assets  sold or retired  and the  related  amounts of
accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts in the year of sale or
retirement.  Any  resulting  profit  or loss is  reflected  in the  consolidated
statement of operations.

5.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

Deferred Financing Costs

The  deferred  financing  costs  which  are  included  in  other  assets  on our
consolidated  balance sheets include  issuance costs related to our debt and are
amortized using the straight-line  method which is similar to the results of the
effective interest method.

Derivative Financial Instruments

In the  normal  course of  business,  we use a variety of  derivative  financial
instruments to manage, or hedge,  interest rate risk. These derivative financial
instruments  must be effective in reducing  its interest  rate risk  exposure in
order  to  qualify  for  hedge  accounting.  When  the  terms  of an  underlying
transaction  are modified,  or when the underlying  hedged item ceases to exist,
all  changes  in the fair  value of the  instrument  are  marked-to-market  with
changes  in value  included  in net  income  each  period  until the  derivative
instrument  matures  or is  settled.  Any  derivative  instrument  used for risk
management that does not meet the hedging criteria is marked-to-market  with the
changes in value included in net income.

We use interest rate swaps to  effectively  convert  variable rate debt to fixed
rate debt for the financed portion of fixed rate assets.  The differential to be
paid or received on these  agreements  is  recognized  as an  adjustment  to the
interest expense related to debt and is recognized on the accrual basis.

We have also used  interest  rate caps to reduce our  exposure to interest  rate
changes on investments.  We would have received payments on an interest rate cap
if the  variable  rate  for  which  the cap was  purchased  exceed  a  specified
threshold  level and would have recorded an  adjustment  to the interest  income
related to the related  earning asset.  We had no interest rate caps in place at
December 31, 2004.

To  determine  the fair values of  derivative  instruments,  we use a variety of
methods and assumptions  that are based on market  conditions and risks existing
at each balance sheet date. For the majority of financial  instruments including
most  derivatives,  long-term  investments and long-term  debt,  standard market
conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing
models, replacement cost, and termination cost are used to determine fair value.
All methods of assessing fair value result in a general  approximation of value,
and such value may never actually be realized.

The swap and cap  agreements  are generally  held-to-maturity  and we do not use
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Income Taxes

Our  financial  results  generally  do not  reflect  provisions  for  current or
deferred  income taxes on our REIT taxable income.  Management  believes that we
have and intend to continue  to operate in a manner that will  continue to allow
us to be taxed as a REIT and,  as a  result,  do not  expect to pay  substantial
corporate-level   taxes   (other  than  taxes   payable  by  our  taxable   REIT
subsidiaries).  Many of these  requirements,  however,  are highly technical and
complex. If we were to fail to meet these  requirements,  we would be subject to
Federal income tax.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

We comply with the  provisions of the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board's
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation".  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 123 encourages
the adoption of a fair-value  based accounting  method for employee  stock-based
compensation  plans,  but also  permits  companies  to continue  accounting  for
stock-based  compensation  plans as prescribed by  Accounting  Principles  Board
Opinion  No.  25.  However,   companies  electing  to  continue  accounting  for
stock-based  compensation plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25
must  make  pro  forma  disclosures  as if they  adopted  the  cost  recognition
requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123.

Through December 31, 2003, we continued to account for stock-based  compensation
under Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Accordingly,  no compensation
cost has been  recognized  for the years  ended  December  31, 2003 and 2002 for
awards  under our stock plans in the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of
operations as the exercise price of the stock options granted thereunder equaled
the market price of the  underlying  stock on the date of the grant.  During the
fourth  quarter  of 2004,  we  elected  to  adopt  the  fair  value  recognition
provisions  of  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 123 using the
modified  prospective  method  provided in  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 148,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation - Transition and
Disclosure".  Under the modified  prospective method, we recognized  stock-based
employee compensation costs based upon the fair value recognition  provisions of
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 123 effective January 1, 2004.
Compensation  expense is recognized on the accelerated  attribution method under
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 28.

Pro forma information  regarding net income and net earnings per share of common
stock  has been  estimated  at the date of the  grant  using  the  Black-Scholes
option-pricing  model  based on the  following  assumptions  for the year  ended
December 31, 2002 (no options were granted  during the years ended  December 31,
2004 and 2003):

           Risk-free interest rate                     4.30%
           Volatility                                 25.0%
           Dividend yield                              0.0%
           Expected life (years)                       5.0

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded  options  that have no vesting  restrictions  and are fully
transferable.  In addition,  option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective  assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility.  Because
our employee  stock options have  characteristics  significantly  different from
those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can  materially  affect the fair value  estimate,  in our opinion,  the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of
our employee stock options. The weighted average fair value of each stock option
granted during the year ended December 31, 2002 was $1.64.

For purposes of pro forma  disclosures,  the estimated fair value of the options
is  amortized  to  expense  over the  options'  vesting  period.  Our pro  forma
information  for the years  ended  December  31, 2003 and 2002 is as follows (in
thousands, except for net earnings (loss) per share of common stock):

Comprehensive Income

Effective  January  1, 1998,  we  adopted  the  FASB's  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income" ("SFAS No. 130").
The statement  changes the reporting of certain items currently  reported in the
shareholders' equity section of the balance sheet and establishes  standards for
reporting  of  comprehensive  income  and  its  components  in  a  full  set  of
general-purpose  financial  statements.  Total  comprehensive  income/(loss) was
$59,671,000,  $8,633,000 and ($8,817,000) for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The primary component of comprehensive income other
than  net  income  was  the  unrealized   gain/(loss)  on  derivative  financial
instruments and available-for-sale  securities,  net of related income taxes for
2002. At December 31, 2004, accumulated other comprehensive income is $3,815,000
comprised of unrealized gains on CMBS of $3,621,000 and unrealized gains on cash
flow swaps of $194,000.

Earnings per Share of Common Stock

Earnings per share of common stock are presented  based on the  requirements  of
the FASB's Statement of Accounting Standards No. 128 ("SFAS No. 128"). Basic EPS
is computed based on the income  applicable to common stock (which is net income
or loss reduced by the  dividends on the  preferred  stock)  divided by weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted
EPS is based on the net earnings  applicable  to common stock plus, if dilutive,
interest paid on convertible  trust  preferred  securities,  net of tax benefit,
divided by weighted  average  number of shares of common  stock and  potentially
dilutive  shares of common  stock that were  outstanding  during the period.  At
December 31, 2004,  potentially dilutive shares of common stock include dilutive
common stock options. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, potentially dilutive shares
of common stock include  convertible  trust  preferred  securities  and dilutive
common  stock  options.  At December 31, 2002,  potentially  dilutive  shares of
common stock include  convertible  trust preferred  securities,  dilutive common
stock warrants and options and future commitments for stock unit awards.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States  requires  management to make estimates
and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial  statements and the reported  amounts of revenues and expenses  during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain  reclassifications  have been made in the  presentation  of the 2003 and
2002 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2004 presentation.

Segment Reporting

We established  two reportable  segments  beginning  January 1, 2003. We have an
internal information system that produces performance and asset data for its two
segments along service lines.

The Balance Sheet Investment  segment includes all of our activities  related to
direct loan and investment  activities  (including direct  investments in Funds)
and the financing thereof.

The Investment  Management  segment  includes all of our  activities  related to
investment  management  services  provided  to us and  third-party  funds  under
management and includes our taxable REIT  subsidiary,  CT Investment  Management
Co., LLC and its subsidiaries.

5.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

Prior to January 1, 2003, we managed our  operations  as one segment,  therefore
separate  segment  reporting  is  not  presented  for  2002,  as  the  financial
information for that segment is the same as the information in the  consolidated
financial statements.

New Accounting Pronouncements

On December 16, 2004, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),  "Share-Based Payment", which is a
revision of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 123 and supersedes
APB Opinion No. 25.  Statement  of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  123(R)
requires all  share-based  payments to employees,  including  grants of employee
stock  options,  to be  valued  at fair  value on the date of  grant,  and to be
expensed over the applicable  vesting period. Pro forma disclosure of the income
statement effects of share-based payments is no longer an alternative. Statement
of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 123(R) is effective for all  stock-based
awards  granted on or after  July 1,  2005.  In  addition,  companies  must also
recognize  compensation  expense related to any awards that are not fully vested
as of the effective date.  Compensation  expense for the unvested awards will be
measured  based  on the  fair  value  of the  awards  previously  calculated  in
developing  the pro forma  disclosures  in  accordance  with the  provisions  of
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  123.  As we  have  adopted
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. No. 123  effective  January 1,
2004,  we do not believe that  adoption of  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards 123(R) will have a material impact on our future financial results.

</TABLE>

On June 14, 2004, we sold our entire portfolio of available-for-sale  securities
for a gain of $300,000 over their amortized cost.

7.  Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities

We acquire rated and unrated subordinated investments in public and private CMBS
issues.

Because  of  a  decision  to  sell  a  held-to-maturity  security  in  1998,  we
transferred all of our investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities from
held-to-maturity  securities to available-for-sale  and continue to classify the
CMBS as such.

Funding  Corp.,  we acquired a  portfolio  of fixed rate "BB" rated CMBS from an
affiliate of a then existing credit  facility  lender.  The portfolio,  which is
comprised of 11 separate issues with an aggregate face amount of $246.0 million,
was  purchased  for $196.9  million.  In  connection  with the  transaction,  an
affiliate  of the  seller  provided  three-year  term  financing  for 70% of the
purchase  price at a floating rate above the London  Interbank  Offered Rate, or
LIBOR,  and  entered  into an  interest  rate swap for the full  duration of the
portfolio  securities  thereby  providing a hedge for  interest  rate risk.  The
financing  was provided at a rate that was below the current  market for similar
financings  and, as such, we reduced the carrying  amounts of the assets and the
debt by $10.9  million to adjust the yield on the debt to current  market terms.
In June 2002, three sales of CMBS in two issues were completed.  The securities,
which were  specifically  identified  and had a basis of  $31,012,000  including
amortization of discounts,  were sold for $31,371,000 resulting in a net gain of
$359,000.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, we purchased  $6,542,000 face amount of
interests in two CMBS issues for $6,157,000.  During the year ended December 31,
2004,  we purchased  four  investments  in three  separate  issues of commercial
mortgage-backed  securities.  The securities had a face value of $61,293,000 and
were purchased at a discount for $59,551,000. During the year ended December 31,
2004, we received full  satisfaction of one of the issues  purchased in 2003 for
$5,000,000  and received  amortization  payments of $48,000 on one of the issues
purchased in 2004.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we concluded that two of our CMBS investments
with face  amounts  totaling  $11.7  million had incurred  other than  temporary
impairment  due to changes in the  expected  cash flows and recorded a charge of
$5.9 million through the income statement to record these two investments at the
current market value. Our estimates of recoverability  indicate that we will not
recover $1.8 million of the face value on one of the securities written down and
expect full collection of the face value on the other security. We expect a full
recovery  from  our  other  securities  and did not  recognize  any  other  than
temporary impairment on the remaining CMBS investments.

At December 31, 2004,  four CMBS issues with an aggregate  market value of $35.5
million and unrealized  losses of $10.7 million have been in an unrealized  loss
position for greater than twelve months.  One additional  security with a market
value of $29.2  million  and  unrealized  losses of $70,000  have been in a loss
position for less than twelve months.  We believe that these market value losses
are  temporary.  We do not expect any actual  losses in the classes of the bonds
that we hold and  expect the value of the  individual  bonds  will  increase  as
currently delinquent loans are resolved and the bonds approach maturity.

At December 31, 2004, we held nineteen  investments in fourteen  separate issues
of  commercial  mortgage-backed  securities  with an  aggregate  face  value  of
$271,757,000.  Commercial  mortgage-backed  securities  with  a  face  value  of
$61,245,000  earn  interest  at a  variable  rate,  which  averages  the  London
Interbank  Offered Rate, or LIBOR,  plus 2.28% (4.67% at December 31, 2004). The
remaining commercial mortgage-backed  securities,  $210,512,000 face value, earn
interest at fixed rates  averaging  7.65% of the face value. We purchased all of
the commercial mortgage-backed securities at discounts. As of December 31, 2004,
the remaining  discount to be amortized into income over the remaining  lives of
the  securities   was   $22,338,000.   At  December  31,  2004,   with  discount
amortization,  the  commercial  mortgage-backed  securities  earn  interest at a
blended rate of 8.58% of the fair value net of the unamortized  discount.  As of
December 31, 2004,  the securities  were carried at fair value of  $247,765,000,
reflecting a $3,621,000 unrealized gain to their amortized cost. The CMBS mature
at various dates from October 2005 to September  2015. At December 31, 2004, the
expected average life for the CMBS portfolio is 75 months.

8.  Loans Receivable

We have classified our loans receivable into the following general categories:

     o    First  Mortgage  Loans  -  These  are  single-property  secured  loans
          evidenced  by a primary  first  mortgage  and senior to any  mezzanine
          financing  and the owner's  equity.  These loans are bridge  loans for
          equity holders who require interim financing until permanent financing
          can be obtained.  Our first  mortgage loans are generally not intended
          to  be  permanent  in  nature,  but  rather  are  intended  to be of a
          relatively  short-term  duration,  with  extension  options  as deemed
          appropriate,  and typically  require a balloon payment of principal at
          maturity.  We may also  originate and fund  permanent  first  mortgage
          loans in which we intend to sell the senior tranche,  thereby creating
          a property mezzanine loan (as defined below).

     o    Property  Mezzanine  Loans - These are  single-property  secured loans
          which are  subordinate to a primary first mortgage loan, but senior to
          the  owner's  equity.  A  mezzanine  loan  is  evidenced  by  its  own
          promissory   note  and  is   typically   made  to  the  owner  of  the
          property-owning  entity  (i.e.  the senior loan  borrower).  It is not
          secured by the first mortgage on the property,  but by a pledge of all
          of the mezzanine  borrower's ownership interest in the property-owning
          entity. Subject to negotiated contractual restrictions,  the mezzanine
          lender  has the  right,  following  foreclosure,  to  become  the sole
          indirect  owner of the  property  subject  to the lien of the  primary
          mortgage.

     o    B Notes - These are loans  evidenced  by a junior  participation  in a
          first mortgage against a single property;  the senior participation is
          known  as an A Note.  Although  a B Note may be  evidenced  by its own
          promissory  note, it shares a single  borrower and mortgage with the A
          Note and is secured by the same  collateral.  B Note  lenders have the
          same obligations,  collateral and borrower as the A Note lender and in
          most instances are contractually limited in rights and remedies in the
          case of a default.  The B Note is  subordinate to the A Note by virtue
          of a contractual  arrangement between the A Note lender and the B Note
          lender.  For the B Note  lender  to  actively  pursue a full  range of
          remedies, it must, in most instances, purchase the A note.

     o    Corporate  Mezzanine Loans - These are investments in or loans to real
          estate-related   operating  companies,   including  REITs.  Such  loan
          investments take the form of secured debt and may finance, among other
          things,  operations,  mergers and acquisitions,  management  buy-outs,
          recapitalizations,  start-ups and stock buy-backs  generally involving
          real estate and real estate-related entities.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, our loans  receivable  consisted of the following

8.  Loans Receivable, continued

In  connection  with our purchase of the Fund I interest held by an affiliate of
Citigroup Alternative  Investments in January 2003, we recorded additional loans
receivable of $50,034,000 and recorded a $1,690,000  increase to the reserve for
possible  credit  losses on the  acquisition  date.  The assets were recorded at
their  carrying  value from Fund I, which  approximated  the market value on the
acquisition date.

One first mortgage loan with an original principal balance of $8,000,000 reached
maturity on July 15, 2002 and has not been repaid with respect to principal  and
interest.  In December 2002,  the loan was written down to $4,000,000  through a
charge to the  allowance  for  possible  credit  losses.  During the years ended
December  31, 2004 and 2003,  we received  proceeds  of $231,000  and  $731,000,
respectively,  reducing  the  carrying  value  of the  loan  to  $3,038,000.  In
accordance with our policy for revenue recognition,  income recognition has been
suspended on this loan and for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
$930,000, $912,000 and $958,000,  respectively, of potential interest income has
not been recorded.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, we purchased or originated six property
mezzanine  loans  for  $77,282,000  and 63 B Notes  for  $412,420,000,  received
partial repayments on 34 loans totaling $18,215,000 and one mortgage loan, three
property  mezzanine loan and twelve B Notes totaling  $98,207,000 were satisfied
and repaid. We have no outstanding loan commitments at December 31, 2004.

At December 31, 2004, the weighted  average  interest rate in effect,  including
amortization of fees and premiums,  for our performing  loans receivable were as
follows:

   Property mezzanine loans                                      9.22%
   B Notes                                                       7.05%
             Total Loans                                         7.68%

At December 31, 2004, $472,397,000 (85%) of the aforementioned  performing loans
bear  interest at floating  rates  ranging  from LIBOR plus 300 basis  points to
LIBOR  plus 900 basis  points.  The  remaining  $80,729,000  (15%) of loans bear
interest at fixed rates ranging from 8.12% to 11.67%.

The range of maturity dates and weighted  average  maturity at December 31, 2004
of our performing loans receivable was as follows:

                                                                       Weighted

                                         Range of Maturity Dates       Maturity
                                 ----------------------------------   ----------
   Property mezzanine loans      January 2006 to September 2011       42 Months
   B Notes                       April 2005 to August 2008            17 Months
             Total Loans         April 2005 to September 2011         24 Months

There are no loans to a single  borrower or to related  groups of borrowers that
exceed ten percent of total assets.  Approximately 14% and 12% of all performing
loans  are  secured  by  properties  in  New  York  and  Florida,  respectively.
Approximately  30% of all performing  loans are secured by office  buildings and
approximately  27% are  secured  by  hotels.  These  credit  concentrations  are
adequately collateralized as of December 31, 2004.

In connection with the  aforementioned  loans, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, we
have deferred  origination  fees,  net of direct costs of $541,000 and $828,000,
respectively,  which are being  amortized into income over the life of the loan.
At  December  31,  2004  and  2003,  we  have  recorded   $99,000  and  $86,000,
respectively,  of exit fees, which will be collected at the loan pay-off.  These
fees are  recorded as  interest  income on a basis to realize a level yield over
the life of the loans.

8.  Loans Receivable, continued

As of December 31, 2004,  performing loans totaling  $481,199,000 are pledged as
collateral for borrowings on our credit facility, repurchase agreements and term
redeemable securities contract.

Quarterly,  management  reevaluates the reserve for possible credit losses based
upon our current  portfolio  of loans.  Each loan in our  portfolio is evaluated
using our loan risk rating  system which  considers  loan to value,  debt yield,
cash flow stability,  exit plan, loans  sponsorship,  the loan structure and any
other factors  necessary to assess the likelihood of delinquency or default.  If
we believe  that there is a potential  for  delinquency  or default,  a downside
analysis  is prepared to estimate  the value of the  collateral  underlying  our
loan,  and this  potential  loss is  multiplied  by the  default  likelihood.  A
detailed  review of the entire  portfolio was completed at December 31, 2004 and
certain loans that we previously had specific  concerns about were either repaid
or the  conditions  which  caused the concern  were  eliminated.  Based upon the
changes  in  conditions  of these  loans and the  evaluations  completed  on the
remainder  of the  portfolio,  we concluded  that a reserve for possible  credit
losses was no longer  warranted and the reserve was recaptured.  The activity on
the reserve for possible  credit losses on loans  receivable  was as follows for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (in thousands):

As of December 31, 2002, Fund I had loans outstanding totaling $50,237,000,  all
of which were  performing in accordance  with the terms of the loan  agreements.
One loan for $26.0  million,  which was in default  and for which the accrual of
interest  had been  suspended,  was  written  down to $212,000  and  distributed
pro-rata to the members in December 2002.  Upon receipt of our share of the loan
with a face amount of $6,500,000, we disposed of the asset.

On January 31,  2003,  we purchased  from an affiliate of Citigroup  Alternative
Investments  its  75%  interest  in  Fund I for  $38.4  million  (including  the
assumption of liabilities).  As of January 31, 2003, we began  consolidating the
operations of Fund I in our consolidated financial statements.

For the  years  ended  December  31,  2003 and 2002,  we  received  $17,000  and
$530,000, respectively, of fees for management of Fund I.

11.  Long-Term Debt

Credit Facility

Effective  June 27, 2003, we entered into a credit  agreement  with a commercial
lender who has been providing  credit to us since June 8, 1998. The $150 million
credit facility matures July 16, 2005 and has an automatic nine month amortizing
extension option, if not otherwise  extended.  We incurred an initial commitment
fee of  $1,425,000  upon  the  signing  of this  new  agreement  which  is being
amortized over the term of the agreement.

The credit  facility  provides  for advances to fund  lender-approved  loans and
investments  made by us,  which we refer to as "funded  portfolio  assets".  Our
obligations  under the  credit  facility  are  secured  by pledges of the funded
portfolio assets acquired with advances under the credit facility.

Borrowings  under the credit  facility  bears  interest at specified  rates over
LIBOR,  which rates may  fluctuate,  based upon the credit quality of the funded
portfolio  assets.  This  facility  is also  subject  to a minimum  usage fee if
average  borrowings for a quarter are less than a threshold  amount.  The credit
facility provides for margin calls on asset-specific  borrowings in the event of
asset quality and/or market value  deterioration  as determined under the credit
facility. The credit facility contains customary representations and warranties,
covenants  and  conditions  and  events of  default.  The credit  facility  also
contains a covenant  obligating us to avoid  undergoing an ownership change that
results in John R. Klopp or Samuel Zell no longer retaining their senior offices
and directorships with us and practical control of our business and operations.

At December 31, 2004, we have borrowed  $65,176,000 under the credit facility at
an average  interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.74% (4.02% at December 31,  2004).  On
December 31, 2004,  the unused  amount of potential  credit under the  remaining
credit facility was $84,824,000.  Assuming no additional  utilization  under the
credit facility and including the amortization of fees paid and capitalized over
the term of the credit facility,  the all-in effective  borrowing cost was 5.37%
at December 31, 2004. We have pledged assets of  $107,384,000  as collateral for
the borrowing against such credit facility.

11.  Long-Term Debt, continued

Term Redeemable Securities Contract

In connection with the purchase of our BB CMBS portfolio as previously described
in Note 6, an affiliate of the seller provided financing for 70% of the purchase
price,  or $137.8  million,  at a floating  rate of LIBOR  plus 50 basis  points
pursuant  to a term  redeemable  securities  contract.  This  rate was below the
market  rate for  similar  financings,  and,  as such,  a  discount  on the term
redeemable  securities  contract was  recorded to reduce the carrying  amount by
$10.9  million,  which had the effect of adjusting  the yield to current  market
terms. The debt had a three-year term that expired in February 2002.

On February 28, 2002, we entered into a new term redeemable securities contract.
This term redeemable  securities contract was utilized to finance certain of the
assets that were  previously  financed with a maturing  credit facility and term
redeemable securities contract.  The term redeemable securities contract,  which
allowed for a maximum  financing  of $75  million,  was recourse to us and had a
two-year term with an automatic  one-year  amortizing  extension  option, if not
otherwise  extended.  We incurred an initial commitment fee of $750,000 upon the
signing of the term  redeemable  securities  contract  and we paid  interest  at
specified rates over LIBOR. This term redeemable  securities contract expired on
February 28, 2004 and was repaid with the financed  assets being  financed under
the credit facility.

Repurchase Obligations

At December 31, 2004, we were obligated to three counterparties under repurchase
agreements.

The  repurchase  obligation  with the  first  counterparty,  an  affiliate  of a
securities   dealer,   was  utilized  to  finance   commercial   mortgage-backed
securities.  At  December  31,  2004,  we have sold  commercial  mortgage-backed
securities with a book and market value of $245,993,000  and have a liability to
repurchase these assets for $152,435,000 that is non-recourse to us. At December
31, 2003, we sold commercial  mortgage-backed  securities assets with a book and
market value of $151,964,000  and had a liability to repurchase these assets for
$88,365,000.  This  repurchase  obligation  had an original  one-year  term that
expired in February 2003 and was extended three times to its current maturity in
March 2006. The liability  balance bears interest at specified  rates over LIBOR
based upon each asset included in the obligation.

The first  repurchase  obligation  with the second  counterparty,  a  securities
dealer,  was  entered  into on May 28,  2003  pursuant  to the terms of a master
repurchase  agreement  that,  as increased  in August  2003,  allows us to incur
$100.0 million of repurchase obligations to finance specific assets. At December
31, 2004,  the master  repurchase  agreement  has been utilized to finance three
loans.  At December 31, 2004, we have sold loans with a book and market value of
$32,645,000 and have a liability to repurchase  these assets for $26,500,000 and
can borrow an additional $98,000 without the need to pledge additional assets as
collateral.  At December 31, 2003, we sold loans with a book and market value of
$53,197,000 and had a liability to repurchase these assets for $16,982,000.  The
master repurchase  agreement was extended during 2004 and now terminates on June
1, 2006 and bears  interest at specified  rates over LIBOR based upon each asset
included in the obligation.

The second repurchase obligation with the second counterparty, was entered into
on August 17, 2004 pursuant to the terms of a master repurchase agreement that
allows us to incur $50.0 million of repurchase obligations to finance specific
assets. At December 31, 2004, the master repurchase agreement has been utilized
to finance nine loans. At December 31, 2004, we have sold loans with a book and
market value of $32,215,000 and have a liability to repurchase these assets for
$20,424,000. The master repurchase agreement terminates on September 1, 2007,
and bears interest at specified rates over LIBOR based upon each asset included
in the obligation.

11.  Long-Term Debt, continued

The repurchase  obligations with the third  counterparty,  a securities  dealer,
were entered into to finance  three  loans.  At December 31, 2004,  we have sold
loans  with a book and  market  value of  $31,140,000  and have a  liability  to
repurchase  these assets for  $25,732,000.  At December 31, 2003, we sold a loan
with a book and market value of  $16,325,000  and had a liability to  repurchase
this asset for  $13,876,000.  The repurchase  agreements  have current  maturity
dates ranging from March 2005 to August 2005.

The  average  borrowing  rate  in  effect  for all  the  repurchase  obligations
outstanding  at December  31, 2004 was LIBOR plus 1.02%  (3.32% at December  31,
2004). Assuming no additional  utilization under the repurchase  obligations and
including the  amortization  of fees paid and  capitalized  over the term of the
repurchase  obligations,  the  all-in  effective  borrowing  cost  was  3.41% at
December 31, 2004.

At December  31,  2003,  we were  obligated  to two other  counterparties  under
repurchase agreements in addition to those above.

The repurchase  obligation  with the first  counterparty,  a securities  dealer,
arose in connection with the purchase of Federal Home Loan Mortgage  Corporation
Gold  available-for-sale  securities.  At December  31,  2003,  we had sold such
assets  with a book and  market  value of  $20,052,000  and had a  liability  to
repurchase these assets for $19,461,000. This repurchase agreement was repaid in
full when the  securities  were sold during  2004.  The  liability  balance bore
interest at LIBOR.

The repurchase  obligations with the other  counterparty,  a securities  dealer,
were entered into during the 2003 in connection  with the purchase of a loan and
CMBS  securities.  At December 31, 2003, we sold a loan and CMBS with a book and
market value of $9,950,000  and had a liability to  repurchase  these assets for
$8,210,000. The repurchase agreements were matched to the term of the underlying
loan  and CMBS  and  were  repaid  when the  assets  were  repaid  in 2004.  The
repurchase  agreements  bore  interest at specified  rates over LIBOR based upon
each asset included in the obligation.

The  average  borrowing  rate  in  effect  for all  the  repurchase  obligations
outstanding  at December  31, 2003 was LIBOR plus 0.99%  (2.15% at December  31,
2003). Assuming no additional  utilization under the repurchase  obligations and
including the  amortization  of fees paid and  capitalized  over the term of the
repurchase  obligations,  the  all-in  effective  borrowing  cost  was  2.65% at
December 31, 2003.

Collateralized Debt Obligations

On July 20, 2004, we issued six tranches of investment grade collateralized debt
obligations,  commonly  known as CDOs,  to third  party  investors  through  our
wholly-owned  subsidiary  Capital Trust RE CDO 2004-1 Ltd., which we refer to as
CDO-1. In the transaction, CDO-1 issued secured investment grade rated CDOs with
a principal  amount of  $252,778,000,  and we purchased  through a  wholly-owned
subsidiary the four  remaining  tranches of unrated and below  investment  grade
rated  CDOs and the  equity  interests  issued  by  CDO-1.  CDO-1 is a  variable
interest  entity and our  ownership  of the  unrated  and  non-investment  grade
tranches  results in us being the primary  beneficiary.  As such, we consolidate
the activity of CDO-1 in our financial statements.

Proceeds from the sale of six  investment  grade  tranches  issued by CDO-1 were
used to purchase a $251.2 million  portfolio of B notes and mezzanine loans from
a third party which are held as collateral in CDO-1. The $72.9 million remaining
assets  pledged  as  collateral  in CDO-1  were  contributed  from our  existing
portfolio of loans and CMBS.  CDO-1 holds these assets,  along with cash,  which
totals  $324,074,000  as  collateral  for the  CDOs.  The six  investment  grade
tranches were issued with floating rate coupons with a combined weighted average
rate of LIBOR + 0.62% (3.03% at December 31,  2004),  have a remaining  expected
average  maturity of 4.5 years as of December 31, 2004, are treated as a secured
financing and are  non-recourse to us. We incurred  $5,508,000 of issuance costs
which will be  amortized  on a level yield basis over the average  life of CDO-1
raising  the all-in  effective  borrowing  cost to LIBOR plus  1.04%.  CDO-1 was
structured  to match  fund the cash  flows  from a  significant  portion  of our
existing and newly acquired B notes, mezzanine loans and CMBS.

12.  Derivative Financial Instruments

We account for derivative financial  instruments in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting  Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and  Hedging  Activities,"  as  amended by  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 138,  "Accounting for Certain  Derivative  Instruments and Certain
Hedging  Activities."  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  133
requires an entity to recognize all  derivatives as either assets or liabilities
in the  consolidated  balance  sheets and to measure those  instruments  at fair
value. Additionally, the fair value adjustments will affect either shareholders'
equity or net income depending on whether the derivative instrument qualifies as
a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity.

In the normal course of business,  we are exposed to the effect of interest rate
changes. We limit these risks by following  established risk management policies
and procedures  including  those for the use of  derivatives.  For interest rate
exposures,  derivatives  are used  primarily  to align  rate  movements  between
interest  rates  associated  with our  loans  and other  financial  assets  with
interest  rates on related  debt  financing,  and  manage the cost of  borrowing
obligations.

We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Further, we have
a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based
upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the
underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge,
we have not sustained a material loss from those instruments, nor do we
anticipate any material adverse effect on our net income or financial position
in the future from the use of derivatives.

To manage  interest rate risk, we may employ  options,  forwards,  interest rate
swaps,  caps and floors or a  combination  thereof  depending on the  underlying
exposure.  To reduce overall  interest  cost, we use interest rate  instruments,
typically interest rate swaps, to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to
fixed  rate debt.  Interest  rate  differentials  that  arise  under  these swap
contracts are recognized as interest expense over the life of the contracts.

Financial reporting for hedges  characterized as fair value hedges and cash flow
hedges are different.  For those hedges characterized as a fair value hedge, the
changes in fair value of the hedge and the hedged item are reflected in earnings
each quarter. In the case of the fair value hedges, we are hedging the component
of interest rate risk that can be directly controlled by the hedging instrument,
and it is this portion of the hedged assets that is recognized in earnings.  The
non-hedged balance is classified as an  available-for-sale  security  consistent
with  Statement of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 115,  "Accounting  for
Certain  Investments  in  Debt  and  Equity  Securities,"  and  is  reported  in
accumulated other comprehensive  income. For those hedges  characterized as cash
flow hedges,  the unrealized  gains/losses in the fair value of these hedges are
reported  on  the  balance  sheet  with a  corresponding  adjustment  to  either
accumulated other comprehensive income or to earnings,  depending on the type of
hedging relationship.

We undertook a fair value hedge to sustain the value of our CMBS holdings.  This
fair  value  hedge,  when  viewed  in  conjunction  with the  fair  value of the
securities,  was intended to sustain the value of those  securities  as interest
rates rise and fall.  During the period  from  January 1, 2002 to  December  20,
2002, we recognized a loss of  $16,234,000  for the decrease in the value of the
swap which was  substantially  offset by a gain of $15,924,000 for the change in
the fair value of the  securities  attributed to the hedged risk  resulting in a
$310,000 charge to unrealized loss on derivative  securities on the consolidated
statement of operations.  In  conjunction  with the sale of the CMBS in 2002, in
order to maintain the effectiveness of the hedge, we reduced the maturity of the
fair value hedge from December  2014 to November 2009 and  recognized a realized
gain for the payments received totaling $940,000. On December 23, 2002, in order
to eliminate accumulated earnings and profits in anticipation of our election of
REIT status for tax  purposes,  the fair value hedge was settled  resulting in a
realized loss of $23.6 million.

12.  Derivative Financial Instruments, continued

We  utilize  cash  flow  hedges  in order to better  control  interest  costs on
variable  rate debt  transactions.  Interest  rate swaps that  convert  variable
payments to fixed payments,  interest rate caps, floors,  collars,  and forwards
are  considered  cash flow  hedges.  During the period  from  January 1, 2002 to
December  20,  2002,  the fair  value of the cash flow swaps  decreased  by $3.3
million,  which was deferred into other  comprehensive  loss until the cash flow
hedges were  settled on  December  23,  2002 and the  settlement  amount of $6.7
million was recorded as a charge to earnings.

During the period from  January 1, 2002 to December 20,  2002,  we  recognized a
loss of  $62,000  for the  change in time  value for  qualifying  interest  rate
hedges.  The time value is a component of fair value that must be  recognized in
earnings, and is shown in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized
loss on  derivative  securities.  When  the  interest  rate cap was  settled  on
December 23, 2002, we recognized a realized loss of $51,000 on the  consolidated
statement of operations.

In 2002,  we entered into two cash flow hedge  contracts and in 2004, we entered
into two new cash flow hedge  contracts.  The  following  table  summarizes  the
notional  value  and  fair  value of our  derivative  financial  instruments  at
December 31, 2004.

</TABLE>


On December 31, 2004,  the  derivative  financial  instruments  were reported at
their fair value as  interest  rate hedge  assets and the  increase  in the fair
value of the cash flow swaps from  $168,000 at December  31, 2003 to $194,000 at
December  31,  2004 was  deferred  into other  comprehensive  income and will be
released to earnings  over the remaining  lives of the swaps.  The amount of the
hedges'  ineffectiveness  is immaterial  and reported as a component of interest
expense.

Over  time,  the  unrealized   gains  and  losses  held  in  accumulated   other
comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings.  This reclassification is
consistent  with the  timing of when the  hedged  items are also  recognized  in
earnings. Within the next twelve months, we estimate that $1.5 million currently
held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings,
with regard to the cash flow hedges.

13. Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures

On  July  28,  1998,  we sold  8.25%  step up  convertible  junior  subordinated
debentures in the aggregate  principal  amount of $154,650,000 to CT Convertible
Trust I,  referred  to as the  "Trust".  The Trust  then  privately  placed  and
originally issued 150,000 8.25% step up convertible  trust preferred  securities
(liquidation amount $1,000 per security) with an aggregate liquidation amount of
$150  million to third  parties.  The  convertible  trust  preferred  securities
represented  an  undivided  beneficial  interest in the assets of the Trust that
consisted solely of the step up convertible junior subordinated  debentures that
were  concurrently  sold and originally issued to the Trust. The common interest
in the Trust was sold to us for $4,650,000.  The debentures and trust securities
were  subsequently  modified and then  redeemed  and/or  converted  into class A
common stock as discussed below.

Payments of interest on the step up convertible junior  subordinated  debentures
were payable  quarterly in arrears on each  calendar  quarter-end  and equal the
amounts  necessary for the payment of  distributions  on the  convertible  trust
preferred  securities.  Distributions  were payable only to the extent  payments
were made in respect to the convertible debentures.

13.  Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures, continued

We received  $145,207,000  in net proceeds,  after original issue discount of 3%
from the liquidation  amount of the convertible  trust preferred  securities and
transaction expenses, pursuant to the above transactions, which were used to pay
down our credit  facilities.  The convertible  trust  preferred  securities were
initially  convertible into shares of class A common stock at an initial rate of
85.47  shares  of  class A common  stock  per  $1,000  principal  amount  of the
convertible  debentures  held by the Trust (which was equivalent to a conversion
price of $35.10 per share of class A common stock).

On May 10,  2000,  we  modified  the  terms  of the step up  convertible  junior
subordinated debentures canceling the original underlying convertible debentures
and  new  8.25%  step  up  convertible  junior  subordinated  debentures  in the
aggregate  principal  amount of $92,524,000 and new 13% step up  non-convertible
junior subordinated  debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $62,126,000
were  issued  to the  Trust.  In  connection  with  the  modification,  the then
outstanding  convertible  trust  preferred  securities  were  canceled  and  new
variable  step up  convertible  trust  preferred  securities  with an  aggregate
liquidation  amount of  $150,000,000  were issued to the holders of the canceled
securities in exchange therefore.  The liquidation amount of the new convertible
trust preferred  securities was divided into  $89,742,000 of convertible  amount
and $60,258,000 of non-convertible amount, the distribution,  redemption and, as
applicable, conversion terms of which, mirrored the interest, redemption and, as
applicable,  conversion  terms  of the new  convertible  debentures  and the new
non-convertible debentures, respectively, held by the Trust.

Payments  of  interest  on the  new  step  up  convertible  junior  subordinated
debentures are payable quarterly in arrears on each calendar quarter-end equaled
the  distributions  made  on the new  convertible  trust  preferred  securities.
Distributions  on the new convertible  trust  preferred  securities were payable
only to the extent payments were made in respect to the new debentures.  The new
step up  convertible  junior  subordinated  debentures  initially bore a blended
coupon  rate of 10.16%  per annum  which rate was to vary as the  proportion  of
outstanding convertible amount to the outstanding non-convertible amount changes
and step up in accordance  with the coupon rate step up terms  applicable to the
convertible amount and the non-convertible amount.

The  convertible  amount bore a coupon rate of 8.25% per annum through March 31,
2002 and increased on April 1, 2002 to 10.00% per annum. The convertible  amount
was convertible  into shares of class A common stock, in increments of $1,000 in
liquidation amount, at a conversion price of $21.00 per share.

On September 30, 2002,  the  non-convertible  debentures  were redeemed in full,
utilizing  additional   borrowings  from  the  credit  facility  and  repurchase
agreements,  resulting  in a  corresponding  redemption  in full of the  related
non-convertible amount of convertible trust preferred securities.  In connection
with the redemption transaction,  we expensed the remaining unamortized discount
and  fees on the  redeemed  non-convertible  amount  resulting  in  $586,000  of
additional  expense for the year ended  December 31, 2002.  Prior to redemption,
the non-convertible amount bore a coupon rate of 13.00% per annum.

On July 28, 2004, certain holders of the step up convertible junior subordinated
debentures outstanding converted $44,871,000 of the debentures into 2,136,711
shares of class A common stock and sold the shares in our public offering. On
September 29, 2004, following our issuance of a notice of redemption to be
effected on September 30, 2004, $44,871,000 of the outstanding convertible
debentures were converted into 2,136,711 shares of our class A common stock at a
conversion price of approximately $21.00 per share. The remaining $2,982,000 due
on the convertible debentures was repaid to the Trust and then the Trust
redeemed the common securities held by us.

For financial reporting purposes, in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities," we are not treating the Trust as our subsidiary and, accordingly, the
accounts of the Trust are not included in our consolidated financial statements.
Intercompany transactions between the Trust and us have not been eliminated in
our consolidated financial statements.

14.  Shareholders' Equity

Authorized Capital

We have the authority to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of stock,  consisting of
(i) 100,000,000  shares of class A common stock and (ii)  100,000,000  shares of
preferred  stock.  The  board of  directors  is  generally  authorized  to issue
additional shares of authorized stock without shareholder approval.

Common Stock

Class A common stock are voting shares entitled to vote on all matters presented
to a vote of  shareholders,  except as  provided by law or subject to the voting
rights of any outstanding  preferred stock. Holders of record of shares of class
A common stock on the record date fixed by our board of  directors  are entitled
to receive such  dividends as may be declared by the board of directors  subject
to the rights of the holders of any outstanding preferred stock.

Preferred Stock

We have 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized and have not issued any
shares of preferred stock since we repurchased all of the previously issued and
outstanding preferred stock in 2001.

Common and Preferred Stock Transactions

In March 2000, we commenced an open market stock repurchase  program under which
we were  initially  authorized  to  purchase,  from time to time,  up to 666,667
shares  of class A common  stock.  Since  that time the  authorization  has been
increased by the board of directors to purchase up to 2,366,923  shares of class
A common stock. As of December 31, 2004, we had purchased and retired,  pursuant
to the program,  1,700,584 shares of class A common stock at an average price of
$13.13  per share  (including  commissions).  We did not  repurchase  any of our
common stock during the year ended December 31, 2004.

We have no further  obligations  to issue  additional  warrants to affiliates of
Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  at  December  31,  2004.  The  value of the
warrants  at the  issuance  dates,  $4,636,000,  was  capitalized  and is  being
amortized  over  the  anticipated  lives  of  the  fund  business  venture  with
affiliates  of  Citigroup  Alternative  Investments.  On January  31,  2003,  we
purchased all of the outstanding  warrants to purchase 2,842,822 shares of class
A common stock for $2,132,000.

On June 18, 2003, we issued 1,075,000 shares of class A common stock in a
private placement to thirty-two separate investors. We received net proceeds of
$17.1 million after payment of offering expenses and fees.

On May 11, 2004, we closed on the initial tranche of a direct public offering to
designated controlled affiliates of W. R. Berkley Corporation, which we refer to
as Berkley.  We issued  1,310,000  shares of our class A common  stock and stock
purchase  warrants to purchase  365,000 shares of our class A common stock for a
total purchase price of $30.7 million. On June 21, 2004, we closed on the second
tranche of the direct public offering and issued an additional 325,000 shares of
our  class A  common  stock  for a total  purchase  price of $7.6  million.  The
warrants,  which were set to expire on December  31,  2004,  were  exercised  on
September 13, 2004 to purchase  365,000 shares of our class A common stock for a
total purchase price of $8.5 million.  Pursuant to a director  designation right
granted to Berkley in the transaction, we appointed Joshua A. Polan to our board
of directors.

On July 28,  2004,  we closed on a public  offering of our class A common  stock
pursuant to which we sold 1,888,289 shares and certain selling shareholders sold
2,136,711  shares obtained upon the concurrent  conversion of $44,871,000 of our
outstanding  convertible junior  subordinated  debentures.  All 4,025,000 shares
were  sold to the  public at a price of  $23.75  per  share.  After  payment  of
underwriting  discounts and commissions  and expenses,  we received net proceeds
from the offering of $41.6 million.

On September 29, 2004, following our issuance of a notice of redemption to be
effected on September 30, 2004, $44,871,000 of the convertible junior
subordinated debentures outstanding were converted into 2,136,711 shares of our
class A common stock at a conversion price of approximately $21.00 per share.

16.   Income Taxes

We made an election to be taxed as a REIT under  Section  856(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,  commencing  with the tax year ending December
31,  2003.  As a REIT,  we generally  are not subject to federal  income tax. To
maintain  qualification  as a REIT, we must  distribute at least 90% of our REIT
taxable income to our  stockholders and meet certain other  requirements.  If we
fail to qualify  as a REIT in any  taxable  year,  we will be subject to federal
income tax on our  taxable  income at regular  corporate  rates.  We may also be
subject to certain  state and local  taxes on our  income  and  property.  Under
certain  circumstances,  federal  income  and  excise  taxes  may  be due on our
undistributed  taxable  income.  At  December  31,  2004  and  2003,  we were in
compliance with all REIT requirements.

During the year ended  December  31,  2004,  we recorded  $451,000 of income tax
benefit  resulting from book losses generated by our taxable REIT  subsidiaries.
We believe that our taxable REIT  subsidiaries  will  generate  book earnings in
2005 in excess of the losses  recognized in 2004, and that any potential taxable
losses in 2005 would be recoverable from taxes paid in 2003 and 2004,  requiring
us to recognize the tax benefit.

During the year ended  December  31,  2003,  we recorded  $646,000 of income tax
expense for income  that was  attributable  to taxable  REIT  subsidiaries.  Our
effective  tax rate for the year ended  December  31, 2003  attributable  to our
taxable REIT  subsidiaries was 107.9%.  The difference  between the U.S. federal
statutory tax rate of 35% and the  effective  tax rate was  primarily  state and
local  taxes,  net of  federal  tax  benefit,  and  compensation  in  excess  of
deductible limits.

We have  federal net  operating  loss  carryforwards  as of December 31, 2004 of
approximately $3.6 million. Such net operating loss carryforwards expire through
2021.  Due to an ownership  change in January 1997 and another  prior  ownership
change,  a  substantial  portion of the net  operating  loss  carryforwards  are
limited for federal income tax purposes to approximately  $1.4 million annually.
Any unused portion of such annual  limitation  can be carried  forward to future
periods. We also have federal capital loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2004
of approximately $9.0 million that expire through 2008. The utilization of these
carryforwards  would not reduce federal  income taxes but would reduce  required
distributions to maintain REIT status.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for tax reporting purposes.

As we are operating in a manner to meet the qualifications to be taxed as a REIT
for federal  income tax purposes  during the 2004 tax year,  we do not expect we
will be liable for income taxes or taxes on "built-in gain" on our assets at the
federal level or in most states in future years,  other than on our taxable REIT
subsidiary.  Accordingly,  we eliminated  substantially  all of our deferred tax
liabilities  other than that related to our taxable REIT  subsidiary at December
31, 2002.  The amounts for 2004 and 2003 relate only to  differences  related to
taxable  earnings of our taxable REIT  subsidiaries.  All dividends  declared in
2003 and 2004 are ordinary income.

17.  Employee Benefit Plans

Employee 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan

We sponsor a 401(k) and profit  sharing plan that allows  eligible  employees to
contribute up to 15% of their salary into the plan on a pre-tax  basis,  subject
to annual limits.  We have committed to make  contributions to the plan equal to
3% of all eligible employees' compensation subject to annual limits and may make
additional  contributions based upon earnings.  Our contribution expense for the
years  ended  December  31,  2004,  2003 and 2002,  was  $99,000,  $103,000  and
$110,000, respectively.

1997 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan

Our 1997 second amended and restated long-term  incentive stock plan permits the
grant of nonqualified  stock option,  incentive stock option,  restricted stock,
stock  appreciation  right,  performance unit,  performance stock and stock unit
awards. A maximum of 527,420 shares of class A common stock may be issued during
the fiscal year 2005 pursuant to awards under the  incentive  stock plan and the
director  stock plan (as discussed  below) in addition to the shares  subject to
awards  outstanding under the two plans at December 31, 2004. The maximum number
of shares that may be subject to awards to any  employee  during the term of the
plan may not exceed 333,334 shares and the maximum amount payable in cash to any
employee with respect to any performance period pursuant to any performance unit
or performance stock award is $1.0 million.

Incentive stock options shall be exercisable no more than ten years after their
date of grant and five years after the grant in the case of a 10% shareholder
and vest over a period of three years with one-third vesting at each anniversary
date. Payment of an option may be made with cash, with previously owned class A
common stock, by foregoing compensation in accordance with performance
compensation committee or compensation committee rules or by a combination of
these.

Restricted  stock may be granted under the long-term  incentive  stock plan with
performance  goals and  periods of  restriction  as the board of  directors  may
designate.  The  performance  goals may be based on the  attainment  of  certain
objective and/or subjective  measures.  In 2004, 2003 and 2002, we issued 52,515
shares, 17,500 shares and 25,157 shares, respectively,  of restricted stock at a
weighted average price of $22.85, $20.35 and $15.90 per share, respectively.  In
2003,  12,707 shares were canceled upon the  resignation  of employees  prior to
vesting.  The shares of restricted stock issued in 2004 were split with one-half
subject to  performance  and time  vesting  and  one-half  subject  only to time
vesting.  The  performance  and time based  grants  vest on January  26, 2008 if
certain  performance  measures are met and the grantee is employed on that date.
The time vest only grants vest one-third on each of the following dates: January
26, 2005,  January 26, 2006 and January 26, 2007. The shares of restricted stock
issued in 2003 vest one-third on each of the following dates:  February 1, 2004,
February 1, 2005 and February 1, 2006. The shares of restricted  stock issued in
2002 vest one-third on each of the following dates:  February 1, 2003,  February
1, 2004 and February 1, 2005.

The long-term  incentive  stock plan also authorizes the grant of stock units at
any time and from time to time on such terms as shall be determined by the board
of  directors  or  administering  compensation  committee.  Stock units shall be
payable in class A common stock upon the occurrence of certain  trigger  events.
The terms and conditions of the trigger events may vary by stock unit award,  by
the participant, or both.

1997 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan

Our 1997 amended and restated non-employee director stock plan permits the grant
of  nonqualified  stock option,  restricted  stock,  stock  appreciation  right,
performance unit,  performance stock and stock unit awards. A maximum of 527,420
shares  of class A common  stock  may be  issued  during  the  fiscal  year 2005
pursuant to awards under the  director  stock plan and the  long-term  incentive
stock plan, in addition to the shares  subject to awards  outstanding  under the
two plans at December 31, 2004.

The board of directors  shall  determine the purchase price per share of class A
common stock covered by  nonqualified  stock options  granted under the director
stock plan.  Payment of  nonqualified  stock options may be made with cash, with
previously  owned shares of class A common stock,  by foregoing  compensation in
accordance with board rules or by a combination of these payment methods.  Stock
appreciation  rights may be granted under the plan in lieu of nonqualified stock
options, in addition to nonqualified stock options,  independent of nonqualified
stock  options  or  as a  combination  of  the  foregoing.  A  holder  of  stock
appreciation  rights is  entitled  upon  exercise  to receive  shares of class A
common stock,  or cash or a  combination  of both, as the board of directors may
determine,  equal in value on the date of  exercise  to the  amount by which the
fair market  value of one share of class A common  stock on the date of exercise
exceeds the exercise  price fixed by the board on the date of grant (which price
shall  not be less than  100% of the  market  price of a share of class A common
stock on the date of grant)  multiplied  by the  number of shares in  respect to
which the stock appreciation rights are exercised.

17.  Employee Benefit Plans, continued

Restricted  stock may be granted under the director stock plan with  performance
goals and periods of restriction  as the board of directors may  designate.  The
performance  goals may be based on the  attainment of certain  objective  and/or
subjective measures.  The director stock plan also authorizes the grant of stock
units at any time and from time to time on such terms as shall be  determined by
the board of directors. Stock units shall be payable in shares of class A common
stock upon the occurrence of certain trigger events. The terms and conditions of
the trigger events may vary by stock unit award, by the participant, or both.

2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan

Our 2004  amended  and  restated  long-term  incentive  plan,  or the 2004 Plan,
permits the grant of nonqualified  stock option,  incentive stock option,  share
appreciation  right,  restricted share,  unrestricted  share,  performance unit,
performance  share and deferred share unit awards. A maximum of 1,000,000 shares
of class A common stock may be issued under the 2004 Plan.  No  participant  may
receive  options or share  appreciation  rights that relate to more than 500,000
shares per calendar year.

Incentive  stock options shall be exercisable no more than ten years after their
date of grant and five years  after the grant in the case of a 10%  shareholder.
Payment of an option exercise price may be made with cash, with previously owned
class A  common  stock,  through  a  cashless  exercise  program,  surrender  of
restricted shares, restricted share units, share appreciation rights or deferred
share units or by a combination of these methods of payment.

Restricted stock may be granted under the 2004 Plan with  performance  goals and
periods of restriction as the board of directors may designate.  The performance
goals may be based on the  attainment  of certain  objective  and/or  subjective
measures.

The 2004 Plan also authorizes the grant of share units at any time and from time
to time on such  terms as shall  be  determined  by the  board of  directors  or
administering  compensation committee. Share units shall be payable in shares of
class A common stock upon the occurrence of certain  trigger  events.  The terms
and  conditions  of the  trigger  events  may vary by share unit  award,  by the
participant, or both.

17.  Employee Benefit Plans, continued

On July 15, 2004, pursuant to the 2004 Plan, we issued 218,818 restricted shares
in accordance with Mr. Klopp's new employment agreement at a price of $26.47 per
share,  50% of which will be subject to time  vesting in eight  equal  quarterly
increments  commencing  on March 31,  2007 and 50% of which  will be issued as a
performance  compensation  award and will vest on December 31, 2008 if the total
shareholder return,  measured from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2008, is
at least 13% per annum.  As of December  31,  2004,  no other share based awards
have been issued pursuant to the 2004 Plan. A maximum of 781,182 shares of class
A common  stock may be issued  during the fiscal  year 2005  pursuant  to awards
under the 2004 Plan in addition to the shares  subject to awards  outstanding at
December 31, 2004.

18.  Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The Financial  Accounting  Standards Board's  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 107,  "Disclosures  about Fair Value of  Financial  Instruments,"
requires  disclosure  of fair value  information  about  financial  instruments,
whether or not recognized in the statement of financial condition,  for which it
is practicable  to estimate that value.  In cases where quoted market prices are
not available, fair values are based upon estimates using present value or other
valuation  techniques.  Those  techniques  are  significantly  affected  by  the
assumptions  used,  including the discount  rate and the  estimated  future cash
flows. In that regard,  the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated
by comparison to independent  markets and, in many cases,  could not be realized
in immediate  settlement of the  instrument.  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 107 excludes certain  financial  instruments and all non-financial
instruments from our disclosure  requirements.  Accordingly,  the aggregate fair
value amounts do not represent the underlying value of Capital Trust.

The following  methods and  assumptions  were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

   Cash and cash  equivalents:  The  carrying  amount  of cash on hand and money
   market funds is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.

   Available-for-sale  securities:  The fair value was determined based upon the
   market value of the securities.

   Commercial  mortgage-backed  securities:  The  fair  value  was  obtained  by
   obtaining quotes from a market maker in the security.

   Loans  receivable,  net:  The fair values  were  estimated  by using  current
   institutional  purchaser  yield  requirements  for loans with similar  credit
   characteristics.

   Interest  rate cap  agreement:  The fair value was  estimated  based upon the
   amount at which similar financial instruments would be valued.

   Credit  facility:  The credit  facility is at floating  rates of interest for
   which the  spread  over  LIBOR is at rates  that are  similar to those in the
   market currently.  Therefore,  the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of
   fair value.

   Repurchase  obligations:  The  repurchase  obligations,  which are  generally
   short-term in nature,  bear interest at a floating rate and the book value is
   a reasonable estimate of fair value.

   Term redeemable securities contract:  The fair value was estimated based upon
   the amount at which similar  privately placed financial  instruments would be
   valued.

   Convertible  trust preferred  securities:  The fair value was estimated based
   upon the amount at which similar privately placed financial instruments would
   be valued.

   Collateralized debt obligations:  The fair value was estimated based upon the
   amount at which similar placed financial instruments would be valued.

and 2002 were $2,443,000, $2,454,000 and $8,275,000, respectively.

20.  Transactions with Related Parties

We entered into a consulting agreement, dated as of January 1, 1998, with one of
our directors.  The consulting  agreement had an initial term of one year, which
was  subsequently  extended  to December  31,  2002 and then  allowed to expire.
Pursuant to the  agreement,  the director  provided  consulting  services for us
including new business  identification,  strategic  planning and identifying and
negotiating  mergers,  acquisitions,  joint  ventures and  strategic  alliances.
During the year ended  December  31,  2002,  we incurred  expenses of $96,000 in
connection with this agreement.

Effective  January 1, 2001, we entered into a consulting  agreement with another
director. The consulting agreement had an initial term of two years that expired
on December 31, 2002. Under this agreement,  the consultant was paid $15,000 per
month for which the consultant  provided services to us including serving on the
management committees for Fund I and Fund II and any other tasks and assignments
requested by the chief executive officer.  Effective January 1, 2003, we entered
into a new  consulting  agreement with the director with a term of two years and
five  months  that  expires  on May  31,  2005.  Under  the new  agreement,  the
consultant is paid $10,000 per month for which the consultant  provides services
to us including  serving on the  management  committees  for Fund I and Fund II,
serving  on the  board  of  directors  of Fund  III,  and any  other  tasks  and
assignments  requested by the chief  executive  officer.  During the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we incurred expenses of $120,000, $120,000 and
$180,000, respectively in connection with these agreements.

We pay  Equity  Group  Investments,  L.L.C.  and  Equity  Risk  Services,  Inc.,
affiliates  under common control of the chairman of the board of directors,  for
certain corporate  services provided to us. These services include consulting on
insurance matters,  risk management,  and investor  relations.  During the years
ended  December  31,  2004,  2003 and 2002,  we  incurred  $49,000,  $48,000 and
$57,000, respectively, of expenses in connection with these services.

We pay Global  Realty  Outsourcing,  Inc.,  a company in which we have an equity
investment  and on whose board of directors our  president  and chief  executive
officer  serves,  for  consulting  services  relating to  monitoring  assets and
evaluating potential investments. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, we incurred $568,000, $147,000 and $13,000,  respectively, of expenses
in  connection  with these  services.  At December 31, 2004,  we are indebted to
Global  Realty  Outsourcing,  Inc.  for  $93,000  which is  included in accounts
payable and accrued expenses.

We believe that the terms of the foregoing  transactions  are no less  favorable
than could be obtained by us from unrelated parties on an arm's-length basis.

Litigation

material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or our results of
operations.

Employment Agreements

John R. Klopp serves as our chief executive officer and president pursuant to an
employment  agreement entered into on July 15, 1997, which terminated  effective
July 15, 2004,  the  effective  date of his new  employment  agreement  that was
entered into as of February 24, 2004. The new employment  agreement provides for
Mr. Klopp's employment as chief executive officer and president through December
31, 2008 (subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances).

Under the new  employment  agreement,  Mr.  Klopp  receives a base salary and is
eligible  to  receive  annual  performance   compensation  awards  of  cash  and
restricted  shares  of  common  stock.  As of the  effective  date  of  the  new
agreement,  July 15,  2004,  Mr.  Klopp was granted an initial  award of 218,818
restricted  shares,  50% of which will be subject to time vesting in eight equal
quarterly  increments  commencing  on March  31,  2007 and 50% of which  will be
issued as a performance compensation award and will vest on December 31, 2008 if
the total shareholder return, measured from January 1, 2004 through December 31,
2008, is at least 13% per annum.  As of the effective  date,  Mr. Klopp was also
awarded  performance  compensation awards tied to the amount of cash we receive,
if any, as incentive  management  fees from CT Mezzanine  Partners III, Inc. The
agreement  provides for  severance  payments  under  certain  circumstances  and
contains provisions  relating to non-competition  during the term of employment,
protection  of our  confidential  information  and  intellectual  property,  and
non-solicitation  of our  employees,  which  provisions  extend  for  24  months
following termination in certain circumstances.

22.  Segment Reporting

24.  Subsequent Event

On March 4, 2005 we entered into repurchase  agreements with a new counterparty,
a commercial  bank, in connection  with the purchase of nine new loans.  On that
day, we purchased  loans  totaling  $164.6  million and sold them  pursuant to a
