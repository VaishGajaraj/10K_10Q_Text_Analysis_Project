Item 1.     Business
----------------------------------------------------------------

Overview

We  are  a  finance  and  investment  management  company  that  specializes  in
originating and managing  credit-sensitive  structured  financial products.  Our
investment   programs  are  executed  directly  for  our  own  account  and  for
third-party  funds that we manage.  To date,  our  activities  have been focused
exclusively  in the  commercial  real  estate  mezzanine  market  where  we have
originated over $3.4 billion of investments since 1997 and established ourselves
as a leader in that  sector.  We are  organized  and conduct our  operations  to
qualify as a real estate  investment  trust,  or REIT,  for  federal  income tax
purposes and  generally  will not be subject to federal  income tax if we comply
with the applicable income, asset, distribution and organizational requirements.

Developments During Fiscal Year 2003

During  fiscal  year 2003,  we began to conduct our  operations  to qualify as a
REIT. We plan to elect REIT status when we file our federal tax return for 2003.
With our decision to elect to be taxed as a REIT,  we began paying  dividends on
our class A common stock in the first quarter of 2003.

On January 31,  2003,  we purchased  from an affiliate of Citigroup  Alternative
Investments  its 75% interest in CT  Mezzanine  Partners I LLC, or Fund I, for a
purchase  price of  approximately  $38.4  million,  including the  assumption of
liabilities,  equal  to the book  value of the  fund.  In  conjunction  with the
purchase,  we began  consolidating the balance sheet and operations of Fund I in
our consolidated  financial  statements including four loans receivable totaling
$50.0 million and $24.1 million of borrowings under a credit facility.

On April 2, 2003, our charter was amended and restated and then further  amended
to eliminate  from our  authorized  stock the entire  100,000,000  shares of our
authorized  but unissued  class B common stock and to effect a one (1) for three
(3) reverse stock split of our class A common stock. Fractional shares resulting
from the reverse stock split were settled in cash at a rate of $16.65 multiplied
by the percentage of a share owned after the split.

On  April 9,  2003,  CT  Mezzanine  Partners  II  L.P.'s,  or Fund II,  two-year
investment period expired.  During its investment period,  Fund II invested $1.2
billion in 40 separate transactions.

With the  expiration  of the Fund II investment  period,  we resumed our balance
sheet investment  program.  Since April 9, 2003, we have originated or purchased
nine  new  loans   totaling   $99.6  million  and  have   purchased   commercial
mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, of $6.5 million.

On June 2, 2003,  CT Mezzanine  Partners III,  Inc.,  or Fund III,  effected its
initial closing on equity  commitments and on August 8, 2003, its final closing,
raising  a total of  $425.0  million  in equity  commitments.  From the  initial
closing through  December 31, 2003, we have made equity  investments in Fund III
of $2,800,000  and have  capitalized  costs totaling  $914,000,  which are being
amortized  over the remaining  anticipated  life of Fund III. As of December 31,
2003, Fund III had closed eight investments,  totaling $212.6 million,  of which
$182.3 million remains outstanding at December 31, 2003.

On June 18,  2003,  we  issued  1,075,000  shares  of class A common  stock in a
private placement to thirty-two separate investors, led by certain institutional
clients advised by Lend Lease Rosen Real Estate Securities, LLC. Net proceeds to
us were  $17.1  million  after  payment  of  offering  costs and fees to Conifer
Securities, LLC, our placement agent.

Platform

We are a fully integrated, self-managed company that has 25 full-time employees,
all based in New York  City.  Our  senior  management  team has an average of 18
years of experience in the fields of real estate,  credit,  capital  markets and
structured  finance.  Around this team of  professionals,  we have  developed an
entire  platform  to  originate  and  manage   portfolios  of   credit-sensitive
structured products. Founded on our long-standing  relationships with borrowers,
brokers and first mortgage providers, our extensive origination network produces
multiple  investment  opportunities from which we select only those transactions
that we believe  exhibit a compelling  risk/return  profile.  Once a transaction
that meets our parameters is identified,  we apply a disciplined process founded
on four elements:

        o    intense credit underwriting,

        o    creative financial structuring,

        o    efficient use of leverage, and

        o    aggressive asset management.

The first  element,  and the foundation of our past and future  success,  is our
expertise in credit underwriting.  For each prospective investment,  an in-house
underwriting team is assigned to perform a ground-up  analysis of all aspects of
credit risk and we reject any transaction that does not meet our standards.  Our
rigorous underwriting process is embodied in our proprietary credit policies and
procedures  that detail the due  diligence  steps from  initial  client  contact
through  closing.  Input and  approval is  required  from our  finance,  capital
markets, credit and legal teams, as well as from various third-parties including
our credit providers.

Creative  financial  structuring is the second critical  element in our process.
Based upon our underwriting, we strive to create a customized structure for each
investment  that minimizes our downside risk while  preserving  the  flexibility
needed  by  our  borrower.  Typical  structural  features  in  our  real  estate
investments include  bankruptcy-remote  vehicles,  springing guarantees and cash
flow controls  that are  implemented  when  collateral  performance  drops below
certain levels.

The  prudent  use of leverage  is the third  integral  element of our  platform.
Leverage can increase returns on equity and portfolio  diversification,  but can
also increase  risk.  We control this  financial  risk by actively  managing our
capital structure,  seeking to match the duration and interest rate index of our
assets and liabilities and, where  appropriate,  employing  hedging  instruments
such as interest rate swaps,  caps and other interest rate exchange  agreements.
Our  objective is to minimize  interest  rate risk and  optimize the  difference
between  the yield on our assets and the cost of our  liabilities  to create net
interest  spread.  The  final  element  of  our  platform  is  aggressive  asset
management.  We pride  ourselves on our active style of managing our portfolios.
From closing an investment  through its final  repayment,  our  dedicated  asset
management  team  is  in  constant   contact  with  our  borrowers,   monitoring
performance of the collateral and enforcing our rights.

By adhering to these four key elements that define our platform, we have limited
the loss experience of our investment portfolios to less than 1.0% since 1997.

Business Model

Our business  model is designed to produce a unique mix of net  interest  spread
from our balance sheet investments and fee income from our investment management
operations.  Our goal is to deliver a stable,  growing  stream of earnings  from
these two complementary activities.

Our current balance sheet  investment  program focuses on structured  commercial
real  estate  debt  investments,   including  B  Notes,  subordinate  CMBS,  and
small-balance  (under $15 million) mezzanine loans. As of December 31, 2003, our
interest-earning  balance sheet assets  (excluding  cash,  fund  investments and
other assets) total $358.6 million and had a weighted average  unleveraged yield
of 9.9%. Our  interest-bearing  liabilities as of that date total $197.4 million
and had a weighted average interest rate cost of 3.3%.

We currently manage two private equity funds, Fund II, and CT Mezzanine Partners
III,  Inc.,  or Fund  III.  Both  funds  were  formed  to  specialize  in making
large-balance  commercial real estate mezzanine loans. Fund II made $1.2 billion
of investments in 40 separate  transactions  during its  contractual  investment
period that  commenced in April 2001 and ended in April 2003. As of December 31,
2003, Fund II's remaining  investments  aggregate  $517.6 million,  all of which
were  performing.  Fund III held its initial  closing in June 2003 and its final
closing in August 2003,  ultimately  raising  $425  million of committed  equity
capital.  With leverage, we expect to make over $1 billion of investments during
Fund  III's  investment  period,  which  expires  in June of 2005.  We have made
co-investments  in Fund II and  Fund  III,  and our  wholly-owned  taxable  REIT
subsidiary,  CT  Investment  Management  Co.,  LLC,  acts as the manager of both
funds.  In addition to our pro-rata  share of income as a  co-investor,  we earn
base management  fees and  performance-oriented  incentive  management fees from
each fund. Our investment  management activities are described further under the
caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations".

Commencing  in 2003,  we are  operating  our  business  to qualify as a REIT for
federal  income tax  purposes.  Our primary  objective in deciding to elect REIT
status is to pay dividends to our  shareholders  on a  tax-efficient  basis.  We
manage our balance sheet investments to produce a portfolio that meets the asset
and income  tests  necessary to maintain our REIT  qualification  and  otherwise
conduct our investment management business through our wholly-owned  subsidiary,
CT Investment Management Co., which is subject to federal income tax.

Investment Strategies

Since 1997, our investment  programs have focused on various strategies designed
to take  advantage  of  investment  opportunities  that  have  developed  in the
commercial real estate mezzanine  sector.  These investment  opportunities  have
been created largely by the evolution and growing  importance of  securitization
in the real estate capital markets.  With approximately $2 trillion outstanding,
U.S.  commercial  real  estate  debt is a large  and  dynamic  market  that  had
traditionally been dominated by institutional  lenders such as banks,  insurance
companies  and thrifts  making first  mortgage  loans for retention in their own
portfolios.  Securitized  debt has captured an increasing  share of this market,
growing  from  less  than  5%  of  the  total  amount  outstanding  in  1990  to
approximately  20% by year-end  2002.  More  importantly,  CMBS now accounts for
roughly  40% of annual new  originations  with  domestic  CMBS  issuance in 2003
expected to exceed $75  billion.  In  addition,  many  traditional  lenders have
adopted CMBS standards in their portfolio  lending  programs,  further extending
the influence of securitization in the market.  The essence of securitization is
risk  segmentation,  whereby whole  mortgage loans (or pools of loans) are split
into multiple classes and sold to different buyers based on their risk tolerance
and return requirements. The most senior classes, which have the lowest risk and
therefore the lowest return,  are rated  investment  grade (AAA through BBB-) by
the credit rating  agencies.  The junior  classes,  which are subordinate to the
senior debt but senior to the owner/operator's common equity investment, command
a higher  yield.  These  "mezzanine"  tranches  may carry  sub-investment  grade
ratings or no rating at all.

Depending  on our  assessment  of  relative  value,  our real  estate  mezzanine
investments may take a variety of forms including:

        o  First  Mortgage  Loans  - These  are  single-property  secured  loans
           evidenced by a primary  first  mortgage  and senior to any  mezzanine
           financing  and the owner's  equity.  These loans are bridge loans for
           equity  holders  who  require   interim   financing  until  permanent
           financing can be obtained. Our first mortgage loans are generally not
           intended to be permanent in nature,  but rather are intended to be of
           a relatively  short-term  duration,  with extension options as deemed
           appropriate,  and typically require a balloon payment of principal at
           maturity.  We may also  originate and fund  permanent  first mortgage
           loans in which we intend to sell the senior tranche, thereby creating
           a property mezzanine loan (as defined below).

        o  Property  Mezzanine Loans - These are  single-property  secured loans
           that are  subordinate to a primary first mortgage loan, but senior to
           the  owner's  equity.  A  mezzanine  loan  is  evidenced  by its  own
           promissory   note  and  is  typically   made  to  the  owner  of  the
           property-owning  entity (i.e.  the senior loan  borrower).  It is not
           secured by the first mortgage on the property, but by a pledge of all
           of the mezzanine borrower's ownership interest in the property-owning
           entity. Subject to negotiated contractual restrictions, the mezzanine
           lender  has the  right,  following

                                       3

           foreclosure,  to  become  the sole  indirect  owner  of the  property
           subject to the lien of the primary mortgage.

        o  B Notes - These are loans  evidenced by a junior  participation  in a
           first mortgage against a single property; the senior participation is
           known as an A Note.  Although  a B Note may be  evidenced  by its own
           promissory  note, it shares a single borrower and mortgage with the A
           Note and is secured by the same  collateral.  B Note lenders have the
           same obligations, collateral and borrower as the A Note lender and in
           most  instances are  contractually  limited in rights and remedies in
           the case of a  default.  The B Note is  subordinate  to the A Note by
           virtue of a contractual arrangement between the A Note lender and the
           B Note lender.  For the B Note lender to actively pursue a full range
           of remedies, it must, in most instances, purchase the A note.

        o  Subordinate  CMBS - These commercial  mortgage-backed  securities are
           the junior classes of securitized pools of first commercial  mortgage
           loans.  Cash flows from the  underlying  mortgages are aggregated and
           allocated to the different  classes in accordance with their priority
           ranking,  typically  ranging from the AAA rated  through the unrated,
           first-loss  tranche.  Administration  and  management of the pool are
           performed  by a  trustee  and  servicers,  who act on  behalf  of all
           holders in accordance with  contractual  agreements.  Our investments
           generally  represent the  subordinated  tranches ranging from the BBB
           rated through the unrated class.

        o  Preferred Equity  Interests - These are senior equity  investments in
           property-owning entities. Preferred equity holders have a first claim
           on cash flow and/or  capital  event  proceeds  relative to the common
           equity owner. Following an event of default, preferred equity holders
           have the right to squeeze out the other equity  holders to become the
           primary  owner  of the  property  subject  to the  lien of the  first
           mortgage.  Like true  owners,  preferred  equity  investors  have the
           option to support the loan during temporary cash flow shortfalls.

        o  Corporate Mezzanine Loans - These are investments in or loans to real
           estate-related operating companies, including REITs. Such investments
           may take the form of secured debt,  preferred  stock and other hybrid
           instruments such as convertible debt.  Corporate  mezzanine loans may
           finance,  among other things,  operations,  mergers and acquisitions,
           management buy-outs, recapitalizations, start-ups and stock buy-backs
           generally involving real estate and real estate-related entities.

We  finance  single  properties,  multiple  property  portfolios  and  operating
companies, with our investment typically representing the portion of the capital
structure  ranging  between  50% and 85% of  underlying  collateral  value.  Our
objective is to create  portfolios  which are diversified by investment  format,
property  type and  geographic  market.  The  following  charts  illustrate  the
diversification   achieved  to  date  in  the   origination  of  our  investment
portfolios.

If carefully  underwritten  and  structured,  we believe that portfolios of real
estate  mezzanine  investments can produce superior  risk-adjusted  returns when
compared to both senior debt and direct equity ownership.

Business Plan

Our business plan is to grow our balance sheet  investments  and our third-party
assets  under  management.  We intend to  continue  our  commercial  real estate
investment  programs  and  actively  seek to expand our  franchise  by  pursuing
complementary investment strategies involving other credit-sensitive  structured
products  that  leverage our core skills in credit  underwriting  and  financial
structuring.  We may expand through business  acquisitions or the recruitment of
finance professionals with experience in other products.

Competition

We are  engaged  in a  highly  competitive  business.  We  compete  for loan and
investment opportunities with numerous public and private real estate investment
vehicles,  including  financial  institutions,  mortgage  banks,  pension funds,
opportunity  funds,  REITs  and  other  institutional   investors,  as  well  as
individuals.   Many   competitors  are   significantly   larger  than  us,  have
well-established  operating histories and may have access to greater capital and
other  resources.  In addition,  the  investment  management  industry is highly
competitive  and  there are  numerous  well-established  competitors  possessing
substantially greater financial,  marketing,  personnel and other resources than
us. We compete with other investment  management companies in attracting capital
for funds under management.

Government Regulation

Our  activities,  including  the financing of our  operations,  are subject to a
variety of federal and state regulations. In addition, a majority of states have
ceilings  on  interest  rates  chargeable  to  certain  customers  in  financing
transactions.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003,  we had 25 full-time  employees.  None of our employees
are covered by a collective  bargaining  agreement and management  considers the
relationship with our employees to be good.

Item 7.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
            Condition and Results of Operations

----------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction

We are a  fully  integrated,  self-managed  finance  and  investment  management
company that specializes in credit-sensitive  structured financial products.  To
date,  our investment  programs have focused on loans and  securities  backed by
income-producing  commercial real estate assets.  Since we commenced our finance
business  in  1997,  we have  completed  $3.4  billion  of  real  estate-related
investments  in 117  separate  transactions.  In  December  2002,  our  board of
directors authorized an election to be taxed as a REIT for the 2003 tax year.

Currently,  we make balance sheet  investments  for our own account and manage a
series  of  private  equity  funds on  behalf of  institutional  and  individual
investors.  Our investment management business commenced in March 2000. Pursuant
to a  venture  agreement,  we  have  co-sponsored  three  funds  with  Citigroup
Alternative  Investments LLC: CT Mezzanine Partners I LLC, CT Mezzanine Partners
II LP and CT Mezzanine  Partners III, Inc., which we refer to as Fund I, Fund II
and Fund III, respectively.

Balance Sheet Overview

At December  31, 2003,  we had four  investments  in Federal Home Loan  Mortgage
Corporation  Gold securities  with a face value of  $19,146,000.  The securities
bear  interest  at a fixed  rate of 6.5% of the face  value.  We  purchased  the
securities  at a net premium and have  $145,000 of the premium  remaining  to be
amortized   over  the  remaining   lives  of  the   securities.   After  premium
amortization,  the  securities  bore  interest at a blended  rate of 6.07% as of
December 31, 2003.  As of December 31, 2003,  the  securities  were carried at a
market value of  $20,052,000,  an $761,000  unrealized  gain to their  amortized
cost.

We  held  eighteen   investments  in  twelve   separate   issues  of  commercial
mortgage-backed  securities  with an  aggregate  face value of  $215,512,000  at
December  31,  2003.  $5,000,000  face value of the  commercial  mortgage-backed
securities earn interest at a variable rate which averages the London  Interbank
Offered Rate, or LIBOR,  plus 2.95% (4.11% at December 31, 2003).  The remaining
$210,512,000  face  value  of the  commercial  mortgage-backed  securities  earn
interest at fixed rates  averaging  7.70% of the face value.  We  purchased  the
fixed rate commercial  mortgage-backed  securities at discounts.  As of December
31, 2003, the remaining  discount to be amortized into income over the remaining
lives of the securities was $22,567,000.  After discount amortization, the fixed
rate  securities  earn  interest at a blended  rate of 11.88% as of December 31,
2003. As of December 31, 2003,  the  securities  were carried at market value of
$158,136,000, reflecting a $34,809,000 unrealized loss to their amortized cost.

On January  31,  2003,  we  purchased  Citigroup  Alternative  Investments'  75%
interest  in  Fund  I for a  purchase  price  of  approximately  $38.4  million,
including the assumption of liabilities, equal to the book value of the fund. In
conjunction  with the  purchase,  we began  consolidating  the balance sheet and
operations of Fund I in our  consolidated  financial  statements  including four
loans receivable  totaling $50.0 million and $24.1 million of borrowings under a
credit facility.

In  addition  to those  acquired  with the  purchase  of  Citigroup  Alternative
Investments'  interest in Fund I, we have originated or purchased nine new loans
since  December 31, 2002 totaling  $99.6 million and have no future  commitments
under any existing  loans.  We have  received  full  satisfaction  of four loans
totaling  $68.8  million and partial  repayments on eight loans  totaling  $18.4
million in the year ended  December  31,  2003.  At December  31,  2003,  we had
outstanding loans receivable totaling approximately $183.7 million.

At December 31, 2003, we had fourteen performing loans receivable with a current
carrying value of $180,452,000.  Two of the loans,  totaling  $61,046,000,  bear
interest at a fixed  blended  rate of interest of 11.94%.  The twelve  remaining
loans,  totaling  $119,406,000,  bear  interest  at a variable  rate of interest
averaging  LIBOR plus 5.94% (7.34% at December 31, 2003 including LIBOR floors).
One mortgage loan  receivable with an original  principal  balance of $8,000,000
reached maturity on July 15, 2001 and has not

                                       10

been repaid with respect to principal and interest.  In December  2002, the loan
was written down to  $4,000,000  through a charge to the  allowance for possible
credit losses.  During the year ended December 31, 2003, we received proceeds of
$731,000  reducing the carrying value of the loan to  $3,269,000.  In accordance
with our policy for revenue  recognition,  income recognition has been suspended
on this loan and for the year ended  December  31,  2003,  $912,000 of potential
interest  income  has not been  recorded.  All  other  loans are  performing  in
accordance with their terms.

At December 31, 2003,  we had  investments  in funds of  $21,988,000,  including
$6,571,000  of  unamortized  costs  that were  capitalized  in  connection  with
entering into the venture  agreement and related fund business.  These costs are
being  amortized over the lives of the funds and the related  venture  agreement
and are reflected as a reduction in  income/(loss)  from equity  investments  in
funds.

We utilize  borrowings  under a committed  credit facility and a term redeemable
securities contract,  along with repurchase obligations,  to finance our balance
sheet assets.

At December 31,  2003,  after  assumption  of the debt in  conjunction  with the
purchase of Citigroup Alternative Investments' interest in Fund I, we were party
to two credit  facilities with a commercial  lender that provided for a total of
$150  million  of credit.  On June 27,  2003,  we  formally  combined  under one
facility the  outstanding  borrowings  under the two facilities and extended the
maturity of the combined $150 million credit  facility for two additional  years
to July 16, 2005 on  substantially  the same terms. At December 31, 2003, we had
outstanding borrowings under the credit facility of $38,868,000,  and had unused
potential credit of $111,132,000,  an amount of available credit that we believe
provides  us with  adequate  liquidity  for our  short-term  needs.  The  credit
facility  provides for advances to fund  lender-approved  loans and  investments
made by us.  Borrowings  under the  credit  facility  are  secured by pledges of
assets  owned by us.  Borrowings  under the credit  facility  bear  interest  at
specified rates over LIBOR, which rates may fluctuate,  based upon the perceived
risk of the pledged  assets.  The credit  facility  provides for margin calls on
asset-specific  borrowings  in the event of asset  quality  and/or  market value
deterioration  as  determined  under the credit  facility.  The credit  facility
contains customary representations and warranties,  covenants and conditions and
events of default.  Based upon  borrowings  in place at December 31,  2003,  the
effective  rate on the credit  facility  was LIBOR plus 1.50% (2.62% at December
31, 2003). As of December 31, 2003, we had capitalized  costs of $1,190,000 that
are being  amortized  over the  remaining  life of the facility  (18.5 months at
December 31, 2003). After amortizing these costs to interest expense, the all-in
effective borrowing cost on the facility as of December 31, 2003 was 4.58% based
upon the amount currently outstanding on the credit facility.

On December 31, 2003,  we were party to a term  redeemable  securities  contract
which  provides  for $75 million of financing  for  portfolio  assets.  The term
redeemable  securities  contract has a two-year term, maturing in February 2004,
with  an  automatic  one-year  amortizing  extension  option,  if not  otherwise
extended.  We had borrowings against the term redeemable  securities contract of
$11,651,000  at  December  31,  2003.  We pay  interest  on the term  redeemable
securities contract at specified rates over LIBOR based upon each asset financed
by the term redeemable  securities  contract.  Based upon borrowings in place at
December 31, 2003, the blended rate on the term redeemable  securities  contract
is LIBOR plus 1.91% (3.06% at December 31,  2003).  As of December 31, 2003,  we
had  capitalized  costs of $64,000 that are being  amortized  over the remaining
life of the term redeemable securities contract (2 months at December 31, 2003).
After amortizing these costs to interest expense, the all-in effective borrowing
cost on the  facility  as of  December  31, 2003 was 6.41% based upon the amount
currently outstanding on the term redeemable securities contract.

In May 2003, we entered into a new master repurchase agreement with a securities
dealer that  provided  for  $50,000,000  of  financing,  which was  increased to
$100,000,000 in August 2003. As of December 31, 2003, we had utilized the master
repurchase agreement to finance the purchase of five loans.

In the third quarter of 2003, we entered into another  repurchase  obligation in
connection   with  the  purchase  of  a  loan  and  commercial   mortgage-backed
securities.  The repurchase agreements are matched to the term of the underlying
loan and commercial  mortgage-backed  securities that mature between August 2004
and January 2005 and bear interest at specified rates over LIBOR based upon each
asset included in the obligation.

                                       11

In the fourth  quarter of 2003,  we entered  another  repurchase  obligation  in
connection  with the purchase of a loan.  This  repurchase  agreement  comes due
monthly and has a current maturity date in March 2004.

At  December  31,  2003,  we had total  outstanding  repurchase  obligations  of
$146,894,000.  Based upon  advances in place at December 31,  2003,  the blended
rate on the  repurchase  obligations  is LIBOR plus 0.99% (2.15% at December 31,
2003). We had capitalized  costs of $312,000 as of December 31, 2003,  which are
being  amortized over the remaining life of the  repurchase  obligations.  After
amortizing  these  costs to  interest  expense  based upon the amount  currently
outstanding on the repurchase  obligations,  the all-in effective borrowing cost
on the repurchase  obligations  as of December 31, 2003 was 2.66%.  We expect to
enter into new repurchase obligations at their maturity.

We were party to two cash flow interest rate swaps with a total  notional  value
of $109  million as of December 31, 2003.  These cash flow  interest  rate swaps
effectively  convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt, which is utilized to
finance  assets that earn  interest at fixed rates.  We received a rate equal to
LIBOR (1.12% at December 31, 2003) and pay an average rate of 4.24%.  The market
value of the  swaps at  December  31,  2003 was an asset of  $168,000,  which is
recorded as interest  rate hedge  assets and as an offset to  accumulated  other
comprehensive loss, net on our balance sheet.

We currently have $89,742,000  aggregate  liquidation amount of variable step up
convertible  trust  preferred  securities  outstanding  that were  issued by our
consolidated statutory trust subsidiary, CT Convertible Trust I. The convertible
trust preferred  securities  represent an undivided  beneficial  interest in the
assets of the trust that consists solely of the $92,524,000  aggregate principal
amount  of  our  outstanding  8.25%  step  up  convertible  junior  subordinated
debentures.  The terms of the  securities  mirror the interest,  redemption  and
conversion  terms  of  the  convertible   debentures  held  by  the  trust.  The
convertible  trust preferred  securities are convertible  into shares of class A
common stock,  in increments of $1,000 in  liquidation  amount,  at a conversion
price of $21.00 per share and are  redeemable  by us, in whole or in part, on or
after September 30, 2004.

Distributions  on the outstanding  convertible  trust  preferred  securities are
payable quarterly in arrears on each calendar  quarter-end and correspond to the
payments  of  interest  made on the  debentures,  the sole  assets of the trust.
Distributions are payable only to the extent payments are made in respect to the
debentures.  The  convertible  trust  preferred  securities bear interest at 10%
through  September 30, 2004.  The interest rate increases by 0.75% on October 1,
2004 and on each October 1 thereafter. If the quarterly dividend paid on a share
of our  class A common  stock  multiplied  by four and  divided  by $21.00 is in
excess of the  interest  rate in  effect  at that  time,  then the  holders  are
entitled to be paid additional interest at that rate.

On September 30, 2002, we redeemed $60,258,000  aggregate  liquidation amount of
the convertible trust preferred securities that bore a coupon rate of 13.00% per
annum through the date of redemption.

In 2000, we announced an open market share repurchase program under which we may
purchase,  from time to time, up to 666,667  shares of our class A common stock.
Since that time the  authorization  has been increased by the board of directors
to purchase cumulatively up to 2,366,923 shares of class A common stock.

In March 2003,  we  repurchased  66,427 shares of class A common stock under the
open market share repurchase program from a former employee at a price of $14.25
per share. After the repurchase,  we had purchased and retired,  pursuant to the
program, 1,700,584 shares of class A common stock at an average price of $13.13,
including commissions and had 666,339 shares remaining authorized for repurchase
under the program.

In 2001 and 2002, in connection with the  organization of Fund I and Fund II, we
issued to affiliates of Citigroup  Alternative  Investments warrants to purchase
2,842,822  shares  of class A common  stock.  At  December  31,  2002,  all such
warrants  were  exercisable  at $15.00 per share  exercise  price until March 8,
2005. In January 2003,  we purchased  all of the warrants  outstanding  for $2.1
million.

On June 18,  2003,  we  issued  1,075,000  shares  of class A common  stock in a
private placement to thirty-two separate investors, led by certain institutional
clients advised by Lend Lease Rosen Real Estate Securities,

                                       12

LLC. Net proceeds to us were $17.1 million  after payment of offering  costs and
fees to Conifer Securities, LLC, our placement agent.

At  December  31,  2003,  we had  6,536,345  shares of our class A common  stock
outstanding.

Investment Management Overview

We  operated  principally  as a balance  sheet  investor  until the start of our
investment management business in March 2000 when we entered into a venture with
affiliates of Citigroup Alternative Investments to co-sponsor and invest capital
in a series of commercial real estate mezzanine  investment funds managed by us.
Pursuant  to  the  venture  agreement,   we  have  co-sponsored  with  Citigroup
Alternative  Investments Fund I, Fund II and Fund III. We have capitalized costs
of  $6,571,000,  net,  from the  formation of the venture and the Funds that are
being  amortized  over the  remaining  anticipated  lives of the  Funds  and the
related venture agreement.

Fund I commenced  its  investment  operations  in May 2000 with  equity  capital
supplied solely by Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  (75%) and us (25%). From
May 11,  2000 to April 8,  2001,  the  investment  period  for the fund,  Fund I
completed $330 million of total  investments in 12 transactions.  On January 31,
2003, we purchased from an affiliate of Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  its
75%  interest  in  Fund  I  for  $38.4  million,  including  the  assumption  of
liabilities.  As of January 31, 2003, we began  consolidating  the operations of
Fund I in our consolidated financial statements.

Fund II had its initial  closing on equity  commitments on April 9, 2001 and its
final  closing on August 7, 2001,  ultimately  raising  $845.2  million of total
equity  commitments,  including  $49.7 million (5.9%) and $198.9 million (23.5%)
from us and Citigroup Alternative Investments, respectively. Third-party private
equity investors, including public and corporate pension plans, endowment funds,
financial  institutions and high net worth individuals,  made the balance of the
equity  commitments.  During its two-year  investment  period,  which expired on
April 9, 2003, Fund II invested $1.2 billion in 40 separate  transactions.  Fund
II  utilizes  leverage  to  increase  its  return  on  equity,   with  a  target
debt-to-equity  ratio of 2:1. Total capital calls during the  investment  period
were $329.0  million.  On January 1, 2003, the general partner of Fund II, which
is owned by affiliates of us and Citigroup Alternative Investments,  voluntarily
reduced the management  fees for the remainder of the  investment  period by 50%
due to a lower  than  expected  level of  deployment  of Fund II's  capital.  CT
Investment Management Co. LLC, our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, acts as
the investment  manager to Fund II and receives 100% of the base management fees
paid by the fund. As of April 9, 2003, the end of the Fund II investment period,
CT Investment Management Co. began earning annual base management fees of 1.287%
of invested capital. Based upon Fund II's invested capital at December 31, 2003,
the date upon which the calculation for the next quarter is based, CT Investment
Management Co. will earn base management fees of $574,000 for the quarter ending
March 31, 2004.

Citigroup  Alternative  Investments and us, through our collective  ownership of
the general partner, are also entitled to receive incentive management fees from
Fund II if the return on invested  equity is in excess of 10% after all invested
capital  has been  returned.  The Fund II  incentive  management  fees are split
equally between Citigroup  Alternative  Investments and us. We intend to pay 25%
of our share of the Fund II incentive  management  fees as  long-term  incentive
compensation  to our  employees.  No such  incentive  fees have  been  earned at
December  31,  2003 and as such,  no amount has been  accrued as income for such
potential fees in our financial  statements.  The amount of incentive fees to be
received in the future will depend upon a number of factors, including the level
of interest rates and the fund's  ability to generate  returns in excess of 10%,
which is in turn impacted by the duration and ultimate performance of the fund's
assets.  Potential incentive fees received as Fund II winds down could result in
significant  additional  income from  operations in certain periods during which
such  payments  can be  recorded  as income.  If Fund II's  assets were sold and
liabilities  were settled on January 1, 2004 at the recorded book value,  net of
the allowance for possible  credit  losses,  and the fund equity and income were
distributed, we would record approximately $5.3 million of incentive income.

Since  December 31, 2002, we have made equity  contributions  to Fund II of $5.5
million and equity contributions to Fund II's general partner of $757,000. We do
not anticipate  making any  additional  equity  contributions  to Fund II or its
general  partner.  Our net  investment  in Fund II and its  general  partner  at
December 31, 2003 was $12.7  million.  As of December  31, 2003,  Fund II had 24
outstanding loans and

                                       13

investments  totaling $517.6 million, all of which were performing in accordance
with the terms of their agreements.

On June 2, 2003, Fund III effected its initial closing on equity commitments and
on August 8,  2003,  its final  closing,  raising a total of $425.0  million  in
equity commitments. Our equity commitment was $20.0 million (4.7%) and Citigroup
Alternative  Investments  equity commitment was $80.0 million (18.8%),  with the
balance made by third-party  private equity investors.  From the initial closing
through  December  31,  2003,  we have made  equity  investments  in Fund III of
$2,800,000  and have  capitalized  costs  totaling  $914,000,  which  are  being
amortized  over the remaining  anticipated  life of Fund III. As of December 31,
2003, Fund III had closed eight investments,  totaling $212.6 million,  of which
$182.3 million remains outstanding at December 31, 2003.

CT Investment Management Co. receives 100% of the base management fees from Fund
III  calculated at a rate equal to 1.42% per annum of committed  capital  during
Fund III's two-year investment period,  which expires June 2, 2005, and 1.42% of
invested  capital  thereafter.  Based  upon Fund III's  $425.0  million of total
equity  commitments,   CT  Investment  Management  Co.  will  earn  annual  base
management fees of $6.0 million during the investment  period.  We and Citigroup
Alternative  Investments are also entitled to receive incentive  management fees
from  Fund III if the  return on  invested  equity is in excess of 10% after all
invested  capital  has  been  returned.  We will  receive  62.5%  and  Citigroup
Alternative  Investments  will receive 37.5% of the total  incentive  management
fees.  We expect to  distribute a portion of our share of the Fund III incentive
management fees as long-term incentive compensation to our employees.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002

We reported net income of  $13,525,000  for the year ended December 31, 2003, an
increase  of  $23,263,000  from the net loss of  $9,738,000  for the year  ended
December  31,  2002.   This   increase  was  primarily  the  result  of  certain
transactions in 2002 which reduced net income, including the settlement of three
cash flow hedges resulting in a $6.7 million charge to earnings,  the write-down
of  deferred  tax assets as a result of our  decision  to elect REIT  status for
2003,  the  write-down  of a loan in  Fund I which  caused  a loss  from  equity
investments in funds and the inability to utilize  capital  losses  generated in
2002 to reduce current taxes.  Also  contributing  to the increase in net income
was the  reduction  in income taxes in 2003 in  connection  with our decision to
elect REIT status.  These increases were partially  offset by a recapture of the
allowance for possible credit losses in 2002.

Interest  and  related  income  from  loans and other  investments  amounted  to
$38,246,000  for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of $8,833,000 from
the  $47,079,000   amount  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2002.   Average
interest-earning assets decreased from approximately $473.7 million for the year
ended  December  31,  2002 to  approximately  $356.8  million for the year ended
December 31, 2003.  The average  interest  rate earned on such assets  increased
from 9.9% in 2002 to 10.7% in 2003.  During the year ended December 31, 2003 and
December  31,  2002,  the Company  recognized  $2.8  million  and $4.8  million,
respectively,  in  additional  income  on  the  early  repayment  of  loans  and
investments.  Without this additional  interest income, the earning rate for the
2003 period  would have been 9.9% versus 9.6% for the 2002  period.  LIBOR rates
averaged  1.2% for the year ended  December 31, 2003 and 1.8% for the year ended
December 31, 2002,  a decrease of 0.6%.  The portion of our average  assets that
earn interest at fixed-rates did not decrease proportionately to the decrease in
assets that earn interest at variable rates in 2003,  which served to offset the
decrease in earnings from the decrease in the average LIBOR rate.

We  utilize  our  existing  credit  facility,  the  term  redeemable  securities
contract, and repurchase obligations to finance our interest-earning assets.

Interest and related expenses amounted to $9,845,000 for the year ended December
31,  2003, a decrease of  $8,124,000  from the  $17,969,000  amount for the year
ended  December 31,  2002.  The decrease in expense was due to a decrease in the
amount of average  interest-bearing  liabilities  outstanding from approximately
$260.0  million for the year ended  December  31, 2002 to  approximately  $193.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2003, and a decrease in the average rate
on  interest-bearing  liabilities  from 6.9% to 5.1% for the same  periods.  The
decrease in the average rate is substantially due to the decrease in swap levels
and rates and the  increased  use of  repurchase  agreements  as a percentage of
total  debt in the  2003  period  at lower  spreads  to  LIBOR  than the  credit
facilities utilized in the 2002 period.

We also  utilize  the  capital  provided by the  outstanding  convertible  trust
preferred  securities to finance our  interest-earning  assets.  During the year
ended  December 31, 2003 and 2002,  we  recognized  $9,452,000  and  $8,455,000,
respectively,  of net  expenses  related to its  outstanding  convertible  trust
preferred  securities.  This amount  consisted of  distributions  to the holders
totaling $8,974,000 and $14,439,000,  respectively, and amortization of discount
and origination costs totaling $478,000 and $1,305,000, respectively, during the
year  ended  December  31,  2003 and 2002.  In the 2002  period,  this total was
partially offset by a tax benefit of $7,289,000. Due to our decision to elect to
be taxed as a REIT,  there is no tax benefit for the expense in the 2003 period.
The  decrease  in the  distribution  amount and  amortization  of  discount  and
origination  costs  resulted  from  the  elimination  of the  distributions  and
discount and fees on the $60.3 million non-convertible amount of the convertible
trust preferred securities, which was redeemed on September 30, 2002.

Other revenues  decreased  $325,000 from  $9,924,000 for the year ended December
31, 2002 to $9,599,000  for the year ended  December 31, 2003.  In 2002,  Fund I
increased its allowance for possible  credit losses by  establishing  a specific
reserve for the single non-performing loan it was carrying. The loss from equity
investments  in Funds during the year ended  December 31, 2002 was primarily due
to this additional expense. On January 31, 2003, we purchased from affiliates of
Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  their  75%  interest  in  Fund I and  began
consolidating the operations of Fund I in our consolidated financial statements,
which further reduced  earnings from equity  investments in Funds. On January 1,
2003,  the general  partner of Fund II (owned by  affiliates of us and Citigroup
Alternative  Investments) voluntarily reduced by 50% the management fees charged
to  Fund II for the  remainder  of the  investment  period  due to a lower  than
expected  level of  deployment  of the  Fund's  capital.  This,  along  with the
reduction in income when we began charging  management fees on invested  capital
for Fund II,  partially  offset  by the  management  fees  charged  to Fund III,
reduced our  management  and  advisory  fees from Funds by $2.1  million for the
period.  Also in 2002,  we earned a $2.0  million  fee from our  final  advisory
assignment.

General and  administrative  expenses  decreased $676,000 to $13,320,000 for the
year ended  December 31, 2003 from  $13,996,000  for the year ended December 31,
2002. The decrease in general and  administrative  expenses was primarily due to
reduced employee compensation. We employed an average of 25 employees during the
year ended  December 31, 2003 and 27 during the year ended December 31, 2002. We
had 25 full-time employees at December 31, 2003.

During the year  ended  December  31,  2002,  we  recaptured  $4,713,000  of our
previously  established  allowance for possible  credit  losses.  We deemed this
recapture necessary due to the substantial reduction in the loan portfolio and a
general  reduction in the default risk of the loans remaining based upon current
conditions.  At December 31, 2003,  we believe that the reserve of $6,672,000 is
adequate based on the existing loans in our balance sheet portfolio.

We intend to make an election to be taxed as a REIT under Section  856(c) of the
Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,  commencing with the tax year ending
December 31, 2003.  As a REIT,  we generally  are not subject to federal  income
tax. To maintain qualification as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of our
REIT taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain other requirements.  If
we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable  year, we will be subject to federal
income tax on our  taxable  income at regular  corporate  rates.  We may also be
subject to certain  state and local  taxes on our  income  and  property.  Under
certain  circumstances,  federal  income  and  excise  taxes  may  be due on our
undistributed  taxable income.  At December 31, 2003, we were in compliance with
all REIT  requirements and as such, have only provided for income tax expense on
taxable income attributed to our taxable REIT subsidiaries in 2003.

Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001

We reported a net loss allocable to shares of class A common stock of $9,738,000
for the year ended  December 31, 2002,  a decrease of  $18,502,000  from our net
income  allocable to shares of class A common stock of  $8,764,000  for the year
ended December 31, 2001. This decrease was primarily the result of the inability
to  utilize  capital  losses  generated  in 2002 to reduce  current  taxes,  the
write-down  of  deferred  tax assets as a result of our  decision  to elect REIT
status for 2003,  the  settlement of three cash flow hedges  resulting in a $6.7
million  charge to earnings,  the  write-down of a loan in Fund I which caused a
loss from equity  investments  in funds and decreased  net interest  income from
loans and other investments.  These decreases were partially offset by increased
advisory  and  investment  management  fees, a recapture  of the  allowance  for
possible credit losses and the elimination of the preferred stock dividend.

Interest  and  related  income  from  loans and other  investments  amounted  to
$47,079,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $20,254,000 from
the $67,333,000  amount for the year ended December 31, 2001.  Average  interest
earning assets  decreased from  approximately  $570.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001 to  approximately  $473.7  million for the year ended December
31, 2002. The average  interest rate earned on such assets  decreased from 11.8%
in 2001 to 9.9% in 2002.  During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized
$1.6 million in additional income on the early repayment of loans,  while during
the year ended  December  31, 2001,  we  recognized  $4.8 million in  additional
income on the early repayment of loans. Without this additional interest income,
the  earning  rate for the year  ended  December  31,  2002 would have been 9.6%
versus 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2001. LIBOR rates averaged 1.8% for
the year ended  December 31, 2002 and 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2001,
a decrease of 2.1%. Since substantial  portions of our assets earned interest at
fixed-rates,  the decrease in the average earning rate did not correspond to the
full decrease in the average LIBOR rate.

Interest  and  related  expenses  amounted  to  $17,969,000  for the year  ended
December 31, 2002, a decrease of $8,269,000 from the $26,238,000  amount for the
year ended  December 31, 2001.  The decrease in expense was due to a decrease in
the  amount  of  average   interest   bearing   liabilities   outstanding   from
approximately   $321.8   million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2001  to
approximately $260.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and a decrease
in the average rate paid on interest  bearing  liabilities from 8.2% to 6.9% for
the same periods.  The decrease in the average rate was substantially due to the
increased use of  repurchase  obligations  for debt  financing in the year ended
December  31,  2002 at lower  spreads to LIBOR than those  obtainable  under the
credit facilities  utilized in the year ended December 31, 2001 and the decrease
in the average LIBOR rate.  Due to the decrease in total debt, the percentage of
debt  that was  swapped  to fixed  rates in the year  ended  December  31,  2002
increased,  partially  offsetting the previously discussed decreases in floating
rates.

During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, we recognized  $8,455,000 and
$8,479,000, respectively, of net expenses related to our outstanding convertible
trust  preferred  securities.  This amount  consisted  of  distributions  to the
holders totaling $14,439,000 and $15,237,000,  respectively, and amortization of
discount and origination costs totaling  $1,305,000 and $799,000,  respectively,
during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. This was partially  offset by
a tax benefit of $7,289,000 and  $7,557,000  during the years ended December 31,
2002 and 2001,  respectively.  On April 1, 2002, in accordance with the terms of
the  securities,  the blended rate on such  securities  increased from 10.16% to
11.21%.  On October 1, 2002, after redemption of the  non-convertible  amount of
the  convertible  trust  preferred  securities,  the rate on such securities was
10.00%.  The  increase in the  amortization  of discount and  origination  costs
resulted  from  the  recognition  of the  unamortized  discount  and fees on the
non-convertible amount expensed upon redemption of the non-convertible amount on
September 30, 2002.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, other revenues decreased  $1,403,000 to
$9,924,000  from  $11,327,000  in the year ended  December 31, 2001.  During the
second  quarter of 2001,  Fund II  commenced  operations,  which  accounted  for
approximately  $2.6 million of  additional  management  and advisory fees in the
year ended  December 31, 2002.  We also  recognized  $2.0 million from our final
advisory  assignment.  These  increases  were offset by the  write-down of a $26
million investment in Fund I, which decreased our income from equity investments
in funds by approximately $6 million.

General and administrative  expenses decreased $1,386,000 to $13,996,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2002 from  $15,382,000 for year ended December 31, 2001.
The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to reduced
executive  compensation.  We employed an average of 27 employees during both the
year ended  December 31, 2002 and the year ended  December  31, 2001.  We had 26
full-time employees and one part-time employee at December 31, 2002.

During the year  ended  December  31,  2002,  we  recaptured  $4,713,000  of our
previously  established  allowance for possible  credit  losses.  We deemed this
recapture necessary due to the substantial reduction in the loan portfolio and a
general  reduction in the default risk of the loans remaining based upon current
conditions.

For the year ended  December 31, 2002 and 2001, we accrued income tax expense of
$22,438,000 and $16,882,000,  respectively,  for federal, state and local income
taxes. The increase from 48.6% to 106.1% in

                                       16


<PAGE>


the effective tax rate was  primarily due to capital  losses being  generated in
2002 that were not deductible for tax purposes in that year and the reduction in
deferred  tax assets due to the  uncertainty  of use in the future.  In December
2002,  when we decided to elect REIT status for 2003, we wrote down our deferred
tax asset to $1.6  million,  due to our  inability  to utilize the  recorded tax
benefits in the future. The remaining $1.6 million deferred tax asset relates to
future  reversals of taxable income in  subsidiaries  which will be taxable REIT
subsidiaries.

The preferred  stock  dividend and dividend  requirement  arose from  previously
issued and outstanding  shares of class A preferred stock.  Dividends accrued on
these shares at a rate of 9.5% per annum on a per share price of $8.07. In 1999,
1,982,275  shares of class A preferred stock were converted into an equal number
of shares of class A common stock  thereby  reducing  the number of  outstanding
shares of class A preferred  stock to 2,106,944 and the dividend  requirement to
$1,615,000 per annum.  In 2001, the remaining  shares of class A preferred stock
were repurchased thereby eliminating the dividend requirement.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At  December  31,  2003,  we had  $8,738,000  in cash.  Our  primary  sources of
liquidity  for  2004  are  expected  to be cash on  hand,  cash  generated  from
operations,  principal and interest  payments received on loans and investments,
additional  borrowings under our credit facility and repurchase  obligations and
proceeds  from the sale of  securities.  We believe these sources of capital are
adequate to meet future cash  requirements  during  2004.  We expect that during
2004, we will use a significant  amount of our  available  capital  resources to
satisfy capital  contributions  required  pursuant to our equity  commitments to
Fund III and to originate new loans and  investments  for our balance sheet.  We
intend to continue to employ leverage on our balance sheet assets to enhance our
return on equity.

We  experienced a net decrease in cash of $1,448,000 for the year ended December
31, 2003,  compared to a net decrease of $1,465,000  for the year ended December
31, 2002. Cash provided by operating  activities  during the year ended December
31, 2003 was $13,532,000, compared to $23,988,000 used during the same period of
2002 as we generated a net loss of $9.7  million and used $23.6  million of cash
to settle a fair value hedge in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2003, cash
provided by investing activities was $5,716,000, compared to $301,336,000 during
the same period in 2002 as we  experienced  lower levels of loan and  investment
repayments in the year ended  December 31, 2003 than in the year ended  December
31, 2002 and we began making new loans and  investments for our balance sheet in
the year  ended  December  31,  2003.  We  utilized  the cash  received  on loan
repayments in both periods to reduce  borrowings under our credit facilities and
our term  redeemable  securities  contract that along with the proceeds from the
private  placement  of  1,075,000  shares  of class A common  stock in June 2003
accounted for  substantially all of the change in the net cash used in financing
activities from  $278,813,000 in the year ended December 31, 2002 to $20,696,000
in the year ended December 31, 2003.

During  the  investment  periods  for Fund I and Fund II, we  generally  did not
originate or acquire loans or commercial mortgage-backed securities directly for
our own balance  sheet  portfolio.  Now that the Fund II  investment  period has
ended, we are originating loans and investments for our own account as permitted
by the provisions of Fund III. We expect to use our available working capital to
make  contributions  to Fund III or any other funds  sponsored by us as and when
required by the equity commitments made by us to such funds.

At December 31, 2003, we had outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of
$38,868,000,  outstanding  borrowings on the term redeemable securities contract
of $11,651,000 and outstanding repurchase obligations totaling $146,894,000. The
terms of these  agreements are described above under the caption  "Balance Sheet
Overview".  At December 31, 2003, we had pledged assets that enable us to borrow
an additional  $43.1 million and had $326.0 million of credit  available for the
financing  of new and existing  unpledged  assets  pursuant to these  sources of
financing.

(1) Fund III's  investment  period  continues  until June 2005 at which time our
equity  commitment to the fund expires.  While we do not believe that all of the
equity  commitment  will be called by December 31, 2004, we have presented it as
such as it could be called by then.


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Impact of Inflation

Our  operating  results  depend in part on the  difference  between the interest
income earned on our  interest-earning  assets and the interest expense incurred
in  connection  with our  interest-bearing  liabilities.  Changes in the general
level of interest rates  prevailing in the economy in response to changes in the
rate of  inflation or  otherwise  can affect our income by affecting  the spread
between our interest-earning  assets and interest-bearing  liabilities,  as well
as, among other things, the value of our interest-earning assets and our ability
to  realize  gains  from  the  sale  of  assets  and  the  average  life  of our
interest-earning  assets.  Interest rates are highly  sensitive to many factors,
including  governmental  monetary and tax policies,  domestic and  international
economic and political considerations,  and other factors beyond our control. We
employ the use of correlated  hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes
in interest rates on our operations,  including  engaging in interest rate swaps
and interest  rate caps to minimize  our exposure to changes in interest  rates.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the
foregoing risks or that we will ultimately  realize an economic benefit from any
hedging contract into which we enter.

Critical Accounting Policies

Changes in management judgment,  estimates and assumptions could have a material
effect on our consolidated  financial statements.  Management has the obligation
to ensure that its policies and  methodologies  are in accordance with generally
accepted accounting  principles.  During 2003, management reviewed and evaluated
its  critical  accounting  policies  and believes  them to be  appropriate.  Our
accounting  policies  are  described  in  Note 4 to our  consolidated  financial
statements.  The  following  is a summary  of our  accounting  policies  that we
believe  are  the  most   affected  by  management   judgments,   estimates  and
assumptions:

Securities Available-for-sale

We have designated our investments in commercial  mortgage-backed securities and
certain other securities as  available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale  securities
are  carried at  estimated  fair value with the net  unrealized  gains or losses
reported as a component of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income/(loss)  in
shareholders'  equity.  Many of these  investments  are relatively  illiquid and
their  values  must be  estimated  by  management.  In making  these  estimates,
management  utilizes market prices provided by dealers who make markets in these
securities, but may, under certain circumstances,  adjust these valuations based
on management's  judgment.  Changes in the valuations do not affect our reported
income or cash flows, but impact  shareholders'  equity and,  accordingly,  book
value per share.

                                       18


<PAGE>


Management must also assess whether  unrealized  losses on securities  reflect a
decline in value  that is other  than  temporary,  and,  accordingly,  write the
impaired security down to its fair value, through a charge to earnings.  We have
assessed our  securities  to first  determine  whether there is an indication of
possible other than temporary  impairment and then where an indication exists to
determine if other than temporary impairment did in fact exist. We expect a full
recovery from our  securities  and did not  recognize  any other than  temporary
impairment. Significant judgment of management is required in this analysis that
includes, but is not limited to, making assumptions regarding the collectibility
of the principal and interest, net of related expenses, on the underlying loans.

Income on these securities  available-for-sale is recognized based upon a number
of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies.  Examples of
these  include,  among other things,  the rate and timing of expected  principal
payments,  including prepayments,  repurchases,  defaults and liquidations,  the
pass-through or coupon rate and interest rate  fluctuations.  Additional factors
that may affect our reported interest income on our  mortgage-backed  securities
include  interest  payment  shortfalls  due to  delinquencies  on the underlying
mortgage  loans and the timing and  magnitude  of credit  losses on the mortgage
loans  underlying the securities  that are a result of the general  condition of
the real estate  market,  including  competition  for tenants and their  related
credit  quality,  and changes in market rental rates.  These  uncertainties  and
contingencies  are  difficult to predict and are subject to future  events which
may alter the assumptions.

We adopted Emerging Issues Task Force 99-20, "Recognition of Interest Income and
Impairment  on  Purchased  and  Retained  Beneficial  Interests  in  Securitized
Financial  Assets" on January 1, 2001. In accordance  with this  guidance,  on a
quarterly basis, when significant  changes in estimated cash flows from the cash
flows  previously  estimated  occur due to actual  prepayment  and  credit  loss
experience,  we calculate a revised yield based on the current amortized cost of
the  investment,  including any other than temporary  impairments  recognized to
date,   and  the  revised  cash  flows.   The  revised  yield  is  then  applied
prospectively to recognize interest income.

Prior to January 1, 2001, we recognized  income from these beneficial  interests
using the effective  interest  method,  based on an  anticipated  yield over the
projected  life  of  the  security.  Changes  in  the  anticipated  yields  were
calculated  due to revisions in our estimates of future and actual credit losses
and  prepayments.  Changes in anticipated  yields resulting from credit loss and
prepayment revisions were recognized through a cumulative catch-up adjustment at
the date of the change  which  reflected  the change in income from the security
from the date of purchase  through the date of change in the anticipated  yield.
The new  yield was then used  prospectively  to  account  for  interest  income.
Changes  in  yields  from   reduced   estimates   of  losses   were   recognized
prospectively.

Loans Receivable

We purchase and originate  commercial mortgage and mezzanine loans to be held as
long-term investments. Management must periodically evaluate each of these loans
for possible impairment. Impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that
we will not be able to collect  all  amounts due  according  to the  contractual
terms of the loan. If a loan is determined to be permanently  impaired, we would
write down the loan through a charge to the reserve for possible  credit losses.
Given the nature of our loan portfolio and the underlying commercial real estate
collateral,  significant  judgment of  management  is  required  in  determining
permanent  impairment and the resulting charge to the reserve which includes but
is not  limited to making  assumptions  regarding  the value of the real  estate
which secures the mortgage loan.

Impairment of Securities

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, when the
estimated  fair value of a security  classified as  available-for-sale  has been
below amortized cost for a significant period of time and we conclude that we no
longer  have the ability or intent to hold the  security  for the period of time
over which we expect the values to recover to amortized  cost, the investment is
written down to its fair value. The resulting charge is included in income,  and
a new cost basis  established.  Additionally,  under Emerging  Issues Task Force
99-20,  when  significant  changes in  estimated  cash flows from the cash flows
previously  estimated occur due to actual  prepayment and credit loss experience
and the present value of the revised cash flows using the current expected yield
is less than the present value of the previously estimated remaining cash flows,
adjusted  for cash  receipts  during  the  intervening  period,  an  other  than
temporary

                                       19


<PAGE>


impairment is deemed to have occurred. Accordingly, the security is written down
to fair value with the resulting  change being included in income and a new cost
basis  established.  In both  instances,  the  original  discount  or premium is
written off when the new cost basis is established.

After  taking  into  account  the  effect of the  impairment  charge,  income is
recognized  under  Emerging  Issues Task Force 99-20 or  Statement  of Financial
Accounting  Standards  No. 91, as  applicable,  using the  market  yield for the
security used in establishing the write-down.

Revenue Recognition

The most  significant  sources of our revenue come from our lending  operations.
For our lending operations,  we reflect income using the effective yield method,
which  recognizes  periodic income over the expected term of the investment on a
constant yield basis.  Management believes our revenue recognition  policies are
appropriate to reflect the substance of the underlying transactions.

Provision For Loan Losses

Our accounting policies require that an allowance for estimated credit losses be
reflected in our  financial  statements  based upon an  evaluation  of known and
inherent risks in our mortgage and mezzanine  loans.  While we have  experienced
minimal  actual  losses on our  lending  investments,  management  considers  it
prudent to reflect  provisions  for loan losses on a portfolio  basis based upon
our  assessment  of general  market  conditions,  our internal  risk  management
policies and credit risk rating system, industry loss experience, our assessment
of the likelihood of delinquencies or defaults,  and the value of the collateral
underlying our investments.  Actual losses, if any, could ultimately differ from
these estimates.

Risk Management And Financial Instruments

We utilize  derivative  financial  instruments  as a means to help to manage our
interest rate risk exposure on a portion of our variable-rate  debt obligations,
through the use of cash flow hedges.  The  instruments  utilized  are  generally
either pay-fixed swaps or LIBOR-based  interest rate caps, which are widely used
in the industry and typically  entered into with major  financial  institutions.
Our accounting  policies generally reflect these instruments at their fair value
with  unrealized   changes  in  fair  value  reflected  in  "Accumulated   other
comprehensive  income" on our consolidated  balance sheets.  Realized effects on
cash flows are generally recognized currently in income.

Income Taxes

Our  financial  results  generally  do not  reflect  provisions  for  current or
deferred  income taxes on our REIT taxable income.  Management  believes that we
have and intend to continue  to operate in a manner that will  continue to allow
us to be taxed as a REIT and,  as a  result,  do not  expect to pay  substantial
corporate-level   taxes   (other  than  taxes   payable  by  our  taxable   REIT
subsidiaries).  Many of these  requirements,  however,  are highly technical and
complex. If we were to fail to meet these  requirements,  we would be subject to
Federal income tax.

New Accounting Standards

In September 2000, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting Standards No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing
of Financial  Assets and  Extinguishments  of  Liabilities."  This  statement is
applicable for transfers of assets and extinguishments of liabilities  occurring
after June 30, 2001. We adopted the provisions of this statement as required for
all  transactions  entered  into on or after  January 1, 2001.  Our  adoption of
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 140 did not have a significant
impact on us.

On January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended
by  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  137 and  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 138,  "Accounting  for Certain  Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging  Activities."  Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, as amended,  establishes  accounting and reporting  standards
for  derivative  instruments.  Specifically  Statement of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 133 requires an entity to  recognize  all

                                       20


<PAGE>


derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the  consolidated  balance sheets
and to measure those  instruments  at fair value.  Additionally,  the fair value
adjustments will affect either  shareholders'  equity or net income depending on
whether the derivative  instrument  qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes
and,  if so,  the nature of the  hedging  activity.  As of January 1, 2001,  the
adoption  of  the  new  standard  resulted  in  an  adjustment  of  $574,000  to
accumulated other comprehensive loss.

In the case of the fair value hedge,  we hedged the  component of interest  rate
risk that can be directly controlled by the hedging  instrument,  and it is this
portion of the hedge  assets  that was being  recognized  in  earnings.  Mark to
market on non-hedged available for sale securities and non-hedged aspect of CMBS
are reported in accumulated in other comprehensive  income.  Financial reporting
for  hedges  characterized  as fair  value  hedges  and  cash  flow  hedges  are
different.  For those hedges characterized as a fair value hedge, the changes in
fair value of the hedge and the  hedged  item are  reflected  in  earnings  each
quarter.  In the case of the fair  value  hedge,  we  hedged  the  component  of
interest rate risk that can be directly  controlled  by the hedging  instrument,
and it was this portion of the hedged assets that is recognized in earnings. The
non-hedged balance is classified as an  available-for-sale  security  consistent
with  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 115, and was reported in
accumulated other comprehensive  income. For those hedges  characterized as cash
flow hedges, the unrealized  gains/losses in the fair value of these hedges were
reported  on  the  balance  sheet  with a  corresponding  adjustment  to  either
accumulated other comprehensive income or to earnings,  depending on the type of
hedging relationship.  We discontinued our fair value hedge transaction in 2002.
In  accordance  with  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 133, on
December 31, 2003, the derivative  financial  instruments were reported at their
fair value as interest rate hedge assets of $168,000.

We  are  exposed  to  credit  loss  in  the  event  of  non-performance  by  the
counterparties to the interest rate swap and cap agreements,  although we do not
anticipate such non-performance. The counterparties would bear the interest rate
risk of such transactions as market interest rates increase.

In July 2001, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102, "Selected Loan
Loss  Allowance  and  Documentation   Issues."  Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  102
summarizes  certain of the SEC's  views on the  development,  documentation  and
application of a systematic  methodology for determining allowances for loan and
lease  losses.  Our  adoption of Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  102 did not have a
significant impact on us.

In July 2001,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued  Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" and Statement of
Financial  Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 requires the purchase method
of accounting to be used for all business combinations  initiated after June 30,
2001.  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 141 also  addresses the
initial  recognition  and  measurement of goodwill and other  intangible  assets
acquired  in  business   combinations  and  requires  intangible  assets  to  be
recognized apart from goodwill if certain tests are met.  Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142 requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead
be measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that there
may be an impairment. We adopted the provisions of both statements, as required,
on January 1, 2002 which did not have a significant impact on us.

In October 2001, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 144,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No.
144 provides new guidance on the recognition of impairment  losses on long-lived
assets  to be  held  and  used or to be  disposed  of,  and  also  broadens  the
definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of a
discontinued operation are to be measured and presented.  Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards  No. 144  requires  that current  operations  prior to the
disposition  of corporate  tenant lease assets and prior period  results of such
operations  be  presented  in  discontinued   operations  in  our   consolidated
statements of operations.  The  provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 144 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning  after  December 15, 2001,  and must be applied at the  beginning of a
fiscal year. We adopted the  provisions of this statement on January 1, 2002, as
required, which did not have a significant financial impact on us.

In November  2002, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued  Financial
Accounting  Standards Board  Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's  Accounting and
Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,   Including  Indirect  Guarantees  of
Indebtedness of Others," an  interpretation  of Financial  Accounting  Standards
Board  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 5,  "Accounting  for
Contingencies,"  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 57,  "Related
Party  Disclosures,"  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  107,
"Disclosures  about Fair Value of Financial  Instruments"  and a  rescission  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  Interpretation  No. 34,  "Disclosure of
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an Interpretation of Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 5." It  requires  that upon  issuance of a
guarantee,  the guarantor  must  recognize a liability for the fair value of the
obligation it assumes under that  guarantee  regardless of whether the guarantor
receives  separately  identifiable  consideration,  such as a  premium.  The new
disclosure  requirements  are  effective  December  31,  2002.  Our  adoption of
Interpretation  No.  45 did  not  have a  material  impact  on our  consolidated
financial  statements,  nor is it  expected  to have a  material  impact  in the
future.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued  Interpretation
No. 46,  "Consolidation  of Variable  Interest  Entities," an  interpretation of
Accounting  Research  Bulletin 51.  Interpretation  No. 46 provides  guidance on
identifying  entities  for which  control is achieved  through  means other than
through voting rights,  and how to determine when and which business  enterprise
should  consolidate a variable interest entity. In addition,  Interpretation No.
46 requires that both the primary  beneficiary and all other  enterprises with a
significant  variable  interest in a variable  interest  entity make  additional
disclosures.   The  transitional  disclosure  requirements  took  effect  almost
immediately and are required for all financial statements initially issued after
January 31, 2003. In December 2003,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board
issued a revision of Interpretation  No. 46,  Interpretation No. 46R, to clarify
the provisions of Interpretation  No. 46. The application of Interpretation  No.
46R is effective for public companies,  other than small business issuers, after
March 15, 2004. We have evaluated all of our  investments and other interests in
entities that may be deemed variable  interest  entities under the provisions of
Interpretation No. 46. We have concluded that no additional  entities need to be
consolidated.  Commencing  with  financial  statements  for periods ending after
March  15,  2004,   we  will   deconsolidate   CT   Convertible   Trust  I.  The
deconsolidation should not result in a significant impact to us.

In May 2003,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  150  "Accounting  for  Certain  Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity". This statement
establishes   standards  for  the  classification  and  measurement  of  certain
financial  instruments with  characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The
statement is effective for financial instruments entered into and modified after
May 31, 2003 and  otherwise is effective at the  beginning of the first  interim
period  beginning  after June 15, 2003. It is to be implemented by reporting the
cumulative  effect  of  a  change  in  an  accounting   principle  of  financial
instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing
at the beginning of the interim period of adoption.  The  implementation  of the
statement did not have a material impact on the Company.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
            Risk

----------------------------------------------------------------

The  principal  objective of our  asset/liability  management  activities  is to
maximize net interest income, while minimizing levels of interest rate risk. Net
interest  income and interest  expense are subject to the risk of interest  rate
fluctuations.  To mitigate the impact of  fluctuations in interest rates, we use
interest  rate swaps to  effectively  convert fixed rate assets to variable rate
assets for proper  matching  with variable  rate  liabilities  and variable rate
liabilities  to fixed  rate  liabilities  for  proper  matching  with fixed rate
assets.  Each  derivative  used as a hedge is matched with an asset or liability
with  which  it  has a high  correlation.  The  swap  agreements  are  generally
held-to-maturity and we do not use derivative financial  instruments for trading
purposes.  We use interest rate swaps to effectively  convert variable rate debt
to  fixed  rate  debt  for the  financed  portion  of  fixed  rate  assets.  The
differential  to be paid or received on these  agreements  is  recognized  as an
adjustment  to the interest  expense  related to debt and is  recognized  on the
accrual basis.

The following table provides  information  about our financial  instruments that
are sensitive to changes in interest  rates at December 31, 2003.  For financial
assets and debt  obligations,  the table  presents  cash  flows to the  expected
maturity and weighted  average  interest  rates based upon the current  carrying
values.  For  interest  rate  swaps,  the table  presents  notional  amounts and
weighted  average fixed pay and variable  receive  interest rates by contractual
maturity  dates.  Notional  amounts are used to calculate the  contractual  cash
flows to be exchanged under the contract.  Weighted  average  variable rates are
based on rates in effect as of the reporting date.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  design  and  operation  of  our
"disclosure  controls and  procedures" (as  defined in Rule 13a-14(c)  under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered

participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer.  Based upon this evaluation,  our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief  Financial  Officer  have  concluded  that  our  disclosure  controls  and
procedures (a) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities  Exchange Act is timely
recorded,   processed,   summarized  and  reported  and  (b)  include,   without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be  disclosed  by us in  reports  filed or  submitted  under  the  Securities
Exchange Act is accumulated and  communicated  to our management,  including our
Chief  Executive  Officer and Chief Financial  Officer,  as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Controls

There have been no significant  changes in our "internal  control over financial
reporting"  (as  defined  in rule  13a-15(f))  that  occurred  during the period
covered by this report that has materially  affected or is reasonably  likely to
materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

                         Report of Independent Auditors



The Board of Directors
Capital Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Capital Trust,
Inc. and Subsidiaries  (the "Company") as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
related  consolidated  statements of operations,  shareholders'  equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December 31, 2003.  These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the consolidated  financial  position of the Company at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31,
2003, in conformity with accounting  principles generally accepted in the United
States.

                      Capital Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries
             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)


1.  Organization

References  herein to "we," "us" or "our" refer to Capital  Trust,  Inc. and its
subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.

We  are  a  finance  and  investment  management  company  that  specializes  in
originating and managing credit sensitive structured financial products. We will
continue to make, for our own account and as investment  manager for the account
of funds under management,  loans and debt-related  investments in various types
of commercial real estate assets and operating companies.

On April 2, 2003, our charter was amended and restated and then further  amended
to eliminate  from our  authorized  stock the entire  100,000,000  shares of our
authorized  but unissued  class B common stock and to effect a one (1) for three
(3) reverse stock split of our class A common stock. Fractional shares resulting
from the reverse stock split were settled in cash at a rate of $16.65 multiplied
by the percentage of a share owned after the split.

All per share  information  concerning  the  computation  of earnings per share,
dividends per share,  authorized  stock,  and per share  conversion and exercise
prices reported in the accompanying  consolidated  interim financial  statements
and these notes to  consolidated  financial  statements have been adjusted as if
the  amendments  to our charter were in effect for all fiscal  periods and as of
all balance sheet dates presented.

2.  REIT Election

In December 2002, our board of directors  authorized our election to be taxed as
a real estate  investment trust ("REIT") for the 2003 tax year. We will continue
to make, for our own account and as investment  manager for the account of funds
under management, credit sensitive structured financial products including loans
and debt-related investments in various types of commercial real estate.

In view of our  election  to be taxed as a REIT,  we have  tailored  our balance
sheet  investment  program to  originate  or acquire  loans and  investments  to
produce a portfolio that meets the asset and income tests  necessary to maintain
qualification  as a REIT.  In order to  accommodate  our REIT status,  the legal
structure of future  investment funds we sponsor may be different from the legal
structure of our existing investment funds.

In order to qualify as a REIT,  five or fewer  individuals  may own no more than
50% of our  common  stock.  As a means  of  facilitating  compliance  with  such
qualification, shareholders controlled by John R. Klopp and Craig M. Hatkoff and
trusts for the benefit of the family of Samuel Zell each sold 166,666  shares of
class A common stock to an  institutional  investor in a transaction that closed
on February 7, 2003.  Following this  transaction,  our largest five  individual
shareholders own in the aggregate less than 50% of the class A common stock.

3.  Venture with Citigroup Alternative Investments LLC

On March 8,  2000,  we  entered  into a venture  with  affiliates  of  Citigroup
Alternative  Investments LLC pursuant to which they agreed,  among other things,
to co-sponsor and invest capital in a series of commercial real estate mezzanine
investment  funds managed by us.  Pursuant to the venture  agreement,  which was
amended in 2003, we have  co-sponsored  three funds with  Citigroup  Alternative
Investments;  CT Mezzanine  Partners I LLC, CT  Mezzanine  Partners II LP and CT

3.  Venture with Citigroup Alternative Investments LLC, continued

Fund  I was  formed  in  March  2000.  An  affiliate  of  Citigroup  Alternative
Investments and our wholly owned  subsidiary,  as members thereof,  made capital
commitments  of up to $150  million and $50  million,  respectively.  During its
investment period,  Fund I made  approximately  $330 million of investments.  In
January  2003,  we purchased  the 75% interest in Fund I held by an affiliate of
Citigroup  Alternative  Investments for a purchase price of approximately  $38.4
million  (including the assumption of  liabilities),  equal to the book value of
the fund.  On January 31, 2003,  we began  consolidating  the balance  sheet and
operations of Fund I in our consolidated financial statements.

Fund II was  formed  in April  2001.  Fund II  effected  its  final  closing  on
third-party investor equity commitments in August 2001. Fund II had total equity
commitments  of $845.2  million  including  $49.7  million made by us and $198.9
million made by affiliates  of Citigroup  Alternative  Investments.  Third-party
private  equity  investors  made the remaining  equity  commitments.  During its
investment period (April 9, 2001 to April 9, 2003),  Fund II made  approximately
$1.2 billion of investments.

Fund III was  formed  in June  2003.  Fund III  effected  its final  closing  on
third-party  investor  equity  commitments  in August  2003.  Fund III has total
equity  commitments  of $425  million  including  $20 million made by us and $80
million made by affiliates  of Citigroup  Alternative  Investments.  Third-party
private equity investors made the remaining equity commitments. Through December
31, 2003, Fund III made approximately $213 million of investments.

Our wholly owned  subsidiary,  CT Investment  Management Co., LLC, serves as the
exclusive investment manager to Fund I, Fund II and Fund III.

In connection with entering into the venture  agreement and formation of Fund I,
we issued  to  affiliates  of  Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  warrants  to
purchase  1,416,667  shares  of class A common  stock.  In  connection  with the
closings on  third-party  investor  equity  commitments to Fund II, we issued to
affiliates of Citigroup  Alternative  Investments warrants to purchase 1,426,155
shares of our class A common stock. In total, we had issued warrants to purchase
2,842,822  shares of our class A common  stock.  The  warrants  had a $15.00 per
share exercise price and were exercisable  until expiration on March 8, 2005. We
capitalized  the value of the warrants at issuance and they are being  amortized
over the  anticipated  lives of the Funds.  In January 2003, we purchased all of
the  outstanding  warrants for $2.1 million.  We had no further  obligations  to
issue additional warrants to Citigroup at December 31, 2003.

Revenue Recognition

Interest income for our loans and investments is recognized over the life of the
investment  using the effective  interest  method and  recognized on the accrual
basis.

Fees received in connection with loan commitments,  net of direct expenses,  are
deferred until the loan is advanced and are then recognized over the term of the
loan as an  adjustment  to yield.  Fees on  commitments  that expire  unused are
recognized at expiration.  Exit fees are also recognized over the estimated term
of the loan as an adjustment to yield.

Income  recognition is generally  suspended for loans at the earlier of the date
at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in the opinion of management,
a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful.  Income recognition is
resumed  when  the  loan  becomes   contractually  current  and  performance  is
demonstrated to be resumed.

Fees from  investment  management  services  are  recognized  when  earned on an
accrual basis. Fees from professional advisory services are generally recognized
at  the  point  at  which  all  Company  services  have  been  performed  and no
significant  contingencies  exist with respect to entitlement  to payment.  Fees
from asset management services are recognized as services are rendered.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We classify highly liquid  investments with original  maturities of three months
or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents.  At December 31, 2003 and
2002,  a  majority  of the cash  and cash  equivalents  consisted  of  overnight
investments in commercial  paper. We had no bank balances in excess of federally
insured  amounts at December  31,  2003 and 2002.  We have not  experienced  any
losses on our demand deposits, commercial paper or money market investments.

Available-for-Sale Securities and Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities ("CMBS")

We have designated our investments in commercial  mortgage-backed securities and
certain other securities as  available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale  securities
are  carried at  estimated  fair value with the net  unrealized  gains or losses
reported as a component of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income/(loss)  in
shareholders'  equity.  Many of these  investments  are relatively  illiquid and
management  must estimate their values.  In making these  estimates,  management
utilizes market prices provided by dealers who make markets in these securities,
but  may,  under  certain  circumstances,   adjust  these  valuations  based  on
management's  judgment.  Changes in the  valuations  do not affect our  reported
income or cash flows, but impact  shareholders'  equity and,  accordingly,  book
value per share.

Management must also assess whether  unrealized  losses on securities  reflect a
decline in value  that is other  than  temporary,  and,  accordingly,  write the
impaired security down to its fair value, through a charge to earnings.  We have
assessed our  securities  to first  determine  whether there is an indication of
possible other than temporary  impairment and then where an indication exists to
determine if other than temporary impairment did in fact exist. We expect a full
recovery from our  securities  and did not  recognize  any other than  temporary
impairment. Significant judgment of management is required in this analysis that
includes, but is not limited to, making assumptions regarding the collectibility
of the principal and interest, net of related expenses, on the underlying loans.

4.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

Income on these available-for-sale  securities is recognized based upon a number
of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies.  Examples of
these include,  among other things,  the rate and timing of principal  payments,
including prepayments,  repurchases, defaults and liquidations, the pass-through
or coupon rate and  interest  rate  fluctuations.  Additional  factors  that may
affect our reported interest income on our  mortgage-backed  securities  include
interest  payment  shortfalls due to  delinquencies  on the underlying  mortgage
loans and the  timing  and  magnitude  of credit  losses on the  mortgage  loans
underlying the securities that are a result of the general condition of the real
estate  market,  including  competition  for  tenants and their  related  credit
quality,   and  changes  in  market  rental  rates.   These   uncertainties  and
contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may
alter the assumptions.

We adopted Emerging Issues Task Force 99-20, "Recognition of Interest Income and
Impairment  on  Purchased  and  Retained  Beneficial  Interests  in  Securitized
Financial  Assets" on January 1, 2001. In accordance  with this  guidance,  on a
quarterly basis, when significant  changes in estimated cash flows from the cash
flows  previously  estimated  occur due to actual  prepayment  and  credit  loss
experience,  we calculate a revised yield based on the current amortized cost of
the investment,  including any  other-than-temporary  impairments  recognized to
date,   and  the  revised  cash  flows.   The  revised  yield  is  then  applied
prospectively to recognize interest income.

Impairment of Available-for-Sale Securities and CMBS

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, when the
estimated  fair value of a security  classified as  available-for-sale  has been
below amortized cost for a significant period of time and we conclude that we no
longer  have the ability or intent to hold the  security  for the period of time
over which we expect the values to recover to amortized  cost, the investment is
written down to its fair value. The resulting charge is included in income,  and
a new cost basis  established.  Additionally,  under Emerging  Issues Task Force
99-20,  when  significant  changes in  estimated  cash flows from the cash flows
previously  estimated occur due to actual  prepayment and credit loss experience
and the present value of the revised cash flows using the current expected yield
is less than the present value of the previously estimated remaining cash flows,
adjusted   for   cash   receipts    during   the    intervening    period,    an
other-than-temporary  impairment is deemed to have  occurred.  Accordingly,  the
security is written down to fair value with the resulting  change being included
in income and a new cost basis  established.  In both  instances,  the  original
discount or premium is written off when the new cost basis is established.

After  taking  into  account  the  effect of the  impairment  charge,  income is
recognized  under  Emerging  Issues Task Force 99-20 or  Statement  of Financial
Accounting  Standards  No. 91, as  applicable,  using the  market  yield for the
security used in establishing the write-down.

Loans Receivable and Reserve for Possible Credit Losses

We purchase and originate  commercial mortgage and mezzanine loans to be held as
long-term investments. Management must periodically evaluate each of these loans
for possible impairment. Impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that
we will not be able to collect  all  amounts due  according  to the  contractual
terms of the loan. If a loan were  determined  to be  permanently  impaired,  we
would write down the loan  through a charge to the reserve for  possible  credit
losses.  Given the nature of our loan  portfolio and the  underlying  commercial
real  estate  collateral,  significant  judgment  of  management  is required in
determining permanent impairment and the resulting charge to the reserve,  which
includes  but is not limited to making  assumptions  regarding  the value of the
real estate that secures the mortgage loan.

4.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

Our accounting policies require that an allowance for estimated credit losses be
reflected in our  financial  statements  based upon an  evaluation  of known and
inherent risks in our mortgage and mezzanine  loans.  While we have  experienced
minimal  actual  losses on our  lending  investments,  management  considers  it
prudent to reflect  provisions  for loan losses on a portfolio  basis based upon
our  assessment  of general  market  conditions,  our internal  risk  management
policies and credit risk rating system, industry loss experience, our assessment
of the likelihood of delinquencies or defaults,  and the value of the collateral
underlying our investments.  Actual losses, if any, could ultimately differ from
these estimates.

Sales of Real Estate

We comply with the  provisions of the FASB's  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  No.  66,  "Accounting  for Sales of Real  Estate."  Accordingly,  the
recognition of gains is deferred until such  transactions have complied with the
criteria for full profit recognition under the statement.

Equity  investments  in Fund I, Fund II, CT MP II LLC (which we refer to as Fund
II GP) and Fund III (which together we refer to as Funds)

As the Funds are not majority  owned or controlled by us, we do not  consolidate
the Funds in our consolidated financial statements.  We account for our interest
in the Funds on the equity method of accounting. As such, we report a percentage
of the earnings of the Funds equal to our ownership  percentage on a single line
item  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  operations  as  income  from  equity
investments in the Funds.


Derivative Financial Instruments

In the  normal  course of  business,  we use a variety of  derivative  financial
instruments to manage, or hedge,  interest rate risk. These derivative financial
instruments  must be effective in reducing  its interest  rate risk  exposure in
order  to  qualify  for  hedge  accounting.  When  the  terms  of an  underlying
transaction  are modified,  or when the underlying  hedged item ceases to exist,
all  changes  in the fair  value of the  instrument  are  marked-to-market  with
changes  in value  included  in net  income  each  period  until the  derivative
instrument  matures  or is  settled.  Any  derivative  instrument  used for risk
management that does not meet the hedging criteria is marked-to-market  with the
changes in value included in net income.

We use interest rate swaps to  effectively  convert  variable rate debt to fixed
rate debt for the financed portion of fixed rate assets.  The differential to be
paid or received on these  agreements  is  recognized  as an  adjustment  to the
interest expense related to debt and is recognized on the accrual basis.

We have also used  interest  rate caps to reduce our  exposure to interest  rate
changes on investments.  We would have received payments on an interest rate cap
if the  variable  rate  for  which  the cap was  purchased  exceed  a  specified
threshold  level and would have recorded an  adjustment  to the interest  income
related to the related  earning asset.  We had no interest rate caps in place at
December 31, 2003.

To  determine  the fair values of  derivative  instruments,  we use a variety of
methods and assumptions  that are based on market  conditions and risks existing
at each balance sheet date. For the majority of financial  instruments including
most  derivatives,  long-term  investments and long-term  debt,  standard market
conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing
models, replacement cost, and termination cost are used to determine fair value.
All methods of assessing fair value result in a general  approximation of value,
and such value may never actually be realized.

The swap and cap  agreements  are generally  held-to-maturity  and we do not use
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Equipment and Leasehold Improvements, Net

Equipment  and  leasehold  improvements,  net, are stated at original  cost less
accumulated  depreciation and  amortization.  Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line  method based on the estimated  lives of the  depreciable  assets.
Amortization is computed over the remaining terms of the related leases.

Expenditures  for maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense at the
time incurred.  Expenditures  determined to represent  additions and betterments
are  capitalized.  Cost of assets  sold or retired  and the  related  amounts of
accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts in the year of sale or
retirement.  Any  resulting  profit  or loss is  reflected  in the  consolidated
statement of operations.

Deferred Financing Costs

The  deferred  financing  costs  which  are  included  in  other  assets  on our
consolidated  balance sheets include  issuance costs related to our debt and are
amortized  using the straight line method which is similar to the results of the
effective interest method.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

We comply with the  provisions of the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board's
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation".  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 123 encourages
the  adoption  of  a  new  fair-value  based  accounting   method  for  employee
stock-based  compensation plans. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123 also permits companies to continue  accounting for stock-based  compensation
plans as  prescribed  by Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25.  However,
companies  electing to continue  accounting for stock-based  compensation  plans
under  Accounting   Principles  Board  Opinion  No.  25,  must  make  pro  forma
disclosures as if we adopted the cost recognition  requirements  under Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 123. We have  continued to account for
stock-based  compensation  under  Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25.
Accordingly,  no  compensation  cost has been recognized for the incentive stock
plan or the director stock plan in the accompanying  consolidated  statements of
operations as the exercise price of the stock options granted thereunder equaled
the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant.

Pro forma information regarding net income and net earnings per common share has
been estimated at the date of the grant using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing
model based on the following  assumptions  for the years ended December 31, 2002
and 2001 (no options were granted during the year ended December 31, 2003):

                                             2002               2001
                                      ----------------   ---------------
         Risk-free interest rate             4.30%              4.75%
         Volatility                         25.0%              25.0%
         Dividend yield                      0.0%               0.0%
         Expected life (years)               5.0                5.0

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded  options  that have no vesting  restrictions  and are fully
transferable.  In addition,  option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective  assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility.  Because
our employee  stock options have  characteristics  significantly  different from
those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can  materially  affect the fair value  estimate,  in our opinion,  the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of
our employee  stock  options.  Weighted  average fair value of each stock option
granted  during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $1.64 and $1.47,
respectively.

The pro forma  information  presented above is not  representative of the effect
stock options will have on pro forma net income or earnings per share for future
years.

Income Taxes

Our  financial  results  generally  do not  reflect  provisions  for  current or
deferred  income taxes on our REIT taxable income.  Management  believes that we
have and intend to continue  to operate in a manner that will  continue to allow
us to be taxed as a REIT and,  as a  result,  do not  expect to pay  substantial
corporate-level   taxes   (other  than  taxes   payable  by  our  taxable   REIT
subsidiaries).  Many of these  requirements,  however,  are highly technical and
complex. If we were to fail to meet these  requirements,  we would be subject to
Federal income tax.

Comprehensive Income

Effective  January  1, 1998,  we  adopted  the  FASB's  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income" ("SFAS No. 130").
The statement  changes the reporting of certain items currently  reported in the
shareholders' equity section of the balance sheet and establishes  standards for
reporting  of  comprehensive  income  and  its  components  in  a  full  set  of
general-purpose  financial  statements.  Total  comprehensive  income/(loss) was
$8,633,000, ($8,817,000) and ($9,813,000) for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. The primary component of comprehensive income other
than  net  income  was  the  unrealized   gain/(loss)  on  derivative  financial
instruments and available-for-sale  securities,  net of related income taxes. At
December  31,  2003,  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  is  comprised  of
unrealized losses on CMBS of $34,809,000 and unrealized gains on cash flow swaps
of $168,000  offset by  unrealized  gains on  available-for-sale  securities  of
$761,000 netting to a total of $33,880,000.

Earnings per Share of Common Stock

Earnings per share of common stock are presented  based on the  requirements  of
the FASB's Statement of Accounting Standards No. 128 ("SFAS No. 128"). Basic EPS
is computed based on the income  applicable to common stock (which is net income
or loss reduced by the  dividends on the  preferred  stock)  divided by weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted
EPS is based on the net earnings  applicable  to common stock plus, if dilutive,
dividends  on the  preferred  stock  and  interest  paid  on  convertible  trust
preferred securities,  net of tax benefit, divided by weighted average number of
shares of common stock and potentially dilutive shares of common stock that were
outstanding during the period. At December 31, 2003, potentially dilutive shares
of common stock include convertible trust preferred securities,  dilutive common
stock options. At December 31, 2002, potentially dilutive shares of common stock
include convertible trust preferred  securities,  dilutive common stock warrants
and options and future  commitments for stock unit awards. At December 31, 2001,
potentially  dilutive shares of common stock include the  convertible  Preferred
Stock,  convertible trust preferred  securities,  dilutive common stock warrants
and options and future commitments for stock unit awards.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States  requires  management to make estimates
and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial  statements and the reported  amounts of revenues and expenses  during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain  reclassifications  have been made in the  presentation  of the 2002 and
2001 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2003 presentation.

Segment Reporting

We have established two reportable  segments  beginning January 1, 2003. We have
an internal  information system that produces performance and asset data for its
two segments along service lines.

The Balance Sheet Investment  segment includes all of our activities  related to
direct loan and investment  activities  (including direct  investments in Funds)
and the financing thereof.

The Investment  Management  segment  includes all of our  activities  related to
investment  management  services  provided to us and funds under  management and
includes our taxable REIT  subsidiary,  CT  Investment  Management  Co., and its
subsidiaries.

Prior to January 1, 2003, we managed our  operations  as one segment,  therefore
separate segment  reporting is not presented for 2002 and 2001, as the financial
information for that segment is the same as the information in the  consolidated
financial statements.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2000, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting Standards No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing
of Financial  Assets and  Extinguishments  of  Liabilities."  This  statement is
applicable for transfers of assets and extinguishments of liabilities  occurring
after June 30, 2001. We adopted the provisions of this statement as required for
all  transactions  entered  into on or after  January 1, 2001.  Our  adoption of
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 140 did not have a significant
impact on us.

On January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended
by  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  137 and  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 138,  "Accounting  for Certain  Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging  Activities."  Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, as amended,  establishes  accounting and reporting  standards
for  derivative  instruments.  Specifically  Statement of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 133 requires an entity to  recognize  all  derivatives  as either
assets or  liabilities in the  consolidated  balance sheets and to measure those
instruments at fair value. Additionally,  the fair value adjustments will affect
either  shareholders'  equity or net income  depending on whether the derivative
instrument  qualifies as a hedge for accounting  purposes and, if so, the nature
of the hedging activity. As of January 1, 2001, the adoption of the new standard
resulted in an adjustment of $574,000 to accumulated other comprehensive loss.

In the case of the fair value hedge,  we hedged the  component of interest  rate
risk that can be directly controlled by the hedging  instrument,  and it is this
portion of the hedge  assets  that was being  recognized  in  earnings.  Mark to
market on non-hedged available for sale securities and non-hedged aspect of CMBS
are reported in accumulated in other comprehensive  income.  Financial reporting
for  hedges  characterized  as fair  value  hedges  and  cash  flow  hedges  are
different.  For those hedges characterized as a fair value hedge, the changes in
fair value of the hedge and the  hedged  item are  reflected  in  earnings  each
quarter.  In the case of the fair  value  hedge,  we  hedged  the  component  of
interest rate risk that can be directly  controlled  by the hedging  instrument,
and it was this portion of the hedged assets that is recognized in earnings. The
non-hedged balance is classified as an  available-for-sale  security  consistent
with  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 115, and was reported in
accumulated other comprehensive  income. For those hedges  characterized as cash
flow hedges, the unrealized  gains/losses in the fair value of these hedges were
reported  on  the  balance  sheet  with a  corresponding  adjustment  to  either
accumulated other comprehensive income or to earnings,  depending on the type of
hedging relationship.  We discontinued our fair value hedge transaction in 2002.
In  accordance  with  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 133, on
December 31, 2003, the derivative  financial  instruments were reported at their
fair value as interest rate hedge assets of $168,000.

We  are  exposed  to  credit  loss  in  the  event  of  non-performance  by  the
counterparties to the interest rate swap and cap agreements,  although we do not
anticipate such non-performance. The counterparties would bear the interest rate
risk of such transactions as market interest rates increase.

In July 2001, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102, "Selected Loan
Loss  Allowance and  Documentation  Issues." Staff  Accounting  Bulletin No. 102
summarizes  certain of the SEC's  views on the  development,  documentation  and
application of a systematic  methodology for determining allowances for loan and
lease losses.  Our adoption of Staff Accounting  Bulletin No. 102 did not have a
significant impact on us.

4.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

In July 2001,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued  Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" and Statement of
Financial  Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 requires the purchase method
of accounting to be used for all business combinations  initiated after June 30,
2001.  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 141 also  addresses the
initial  recognition  and  measurement of goodwill and other  intangible  assets
acquired  in  business   combinations  and  requires  intangible  assets  to  be
recognized apart from goodwill if certain tests are met.  Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142 requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead
be measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that there
may be an impairment. We adopted the provisions of both statements, as required,
on January 1, 2002, which did not have a significant impact on us.

In October 2001, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 144,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No.
144 provides new guidance on the recognition of impairment  losses on long-lived
assets  to be  held  and  used or to be  disposed  of,  and  also  broadens  the
definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of a
discontinued operation are to be measured and presented.  Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards  No. 144  requires  that current  operations  prior to the
disposition  of corporate  tenant lease assets and prior period  results of such
operations  be  presented  in  discontinued   operations  in  our   consolidated
statements of operations.  The  provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 144 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning  after  December 15, 2001,  and must be applied at the  beginning of a
fiscal year. We adopted the  provisions of this statement on January 1, 2002, as
required, which did not have a significant financial impact on us.

In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation
No. 45,  "Guarantor's  Accounting and Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,
Including  Indirect  Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," an interpretation of
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.  5,  "Accounting  for  Contingencies,"  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 57, "Related Party Disclosures," Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 107,  "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial  Instruments" and
rescission  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  Interpretation  No. 34,
"Disclosure of Indirect  Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an Interpretation
of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 5." It requires  that upon
issuance of a guarantee,  the guarantor  must recognize a liability for the fair
value of the  obligation it assumes under that  guarantee  regardless of whether
the guarantor receives separately identifiable consideration, such as a premium.
The new disclosure requirements are effective December 31, 2002. Our adoption of
Interpretation  No.  45 did  not  have a  material  impact  on our  consolidated
financial  statements,  nor is it  expected  to have a  material  impact  in the
future.

4.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued  Interpretation
No. 46,  "Consolidation  of Variable  Interest  Entities," an  interpretation of
Accounting  Research  Bulletin 51.  Interpretation  No. 46 provides  guidance on
identifying  entities  for which  control is achieved  through  means other than
through voting rights,  and how to determine when and which business  enterprise
should  consolidate a variable interest entity. In addition,  Interpretation No.
46 requires that both the primary  beneficiary and all other  enterprises with a
significant  variable  interest in a variable  interest  entity make  additional
disclosures.   The  transitional  disclosure  requirements  took  effect  almost
immediately and are required for all financial statements initially issued after
January 31, 2003. In December 2003,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board
issued a revision of Interpretation  No. 46,  Interpretation No. 46R, to clarify
the provisions of Interpretation  No. 46. The application of Interpretation  No.
46R is effective for public companies,  other than small business issuers, after
March 15, 2004. We have evaluated all of our  investments and other interests in
entities that may be deemed variable  interest  entities under the provisions of
Interpretation No. 46. We have concluded that no additional  entities need to be
consolidated.  Commencing  with  financial  statements  for periods ending after
March  15,  2004,   we  will   deconsolidate   CT   Convertible   Trust  I.  The
deconsolidation should not result in a significant impact to us.

In May 2003,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  150  "Accounting  for  Certain  Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity". This statement
establishes   standards  for  the  classification  and  measurement  of  certain
financial  instruments with  characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The
statement is effective for financial instruments entered into and modified after
May 31, 2003 and  otherwise is effective at the  beginning of the first  interim
period  beginning  after June 15, 2003. It is to be implemented by reporting the
cumulative  effect  of  a  change  in  an  accounting   principle  of  financial
instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing
at the beginning of the interim period of adoption.  The  implementation  of the
statement did not have a material impact on the Company.

</TABLE>

We sold three  securities  due  September 1, 2031 in June 2002 with an amortized
cost of $75,006,000 for $75,358,000 resulting in a total gain of $352,000.

6.  Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities

We acquire rated and unrated subordinated investments in public and private CMBS
issues.

Because  of  a  decision  to  sell  a  held-to-maturity  security  in  1998,  we
transferred all of our investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities from
held-to-maturity  securities to available-for-sale  and continue to classify the
CMBS as such.

During the year ended December 31, 1998, we purchased $36,509,000 face amount of
interests in three CMBS issued by a financial  asset  securitization  investment
trust for  $36,335,000.  In April 2001,  we received  $1.4 million of additional
discount  from the issuer of the  securities in settlement of a dispute with the
issuer. In May 2002, we received full satisfaction of $36,509,000. In connection
with the early  payoff,  we recognized  an  additional  $370,000 of  unamortized
discount as additional interest income in 2002.

On March 3, 1999,  through our then newly formed wholly owned subsidiary,  CT-BB
Funding  Corp.,  we acquired a portfolio of  fixed-rate  "BB" rated CMBS from an
affiliate of a then existing credit  facility  lender.  The portfolio,  which is
comprised of 11 separate issues with an aggregate face amount of $246.0 million,
was  purchased  for $196.9  million.  In  connection  with the  transaction,  an
affiliate  of the  seller  provided  three-year  term  financing  for 70% of the
purchase  price at a floating rate above the London  Interbank  Offered Rate, or
LIBOR,  and  entered  into an  interest  rate swap for the full  duration of the
portfolio  securities  thereby  providing a hedge for  interest  rate risk.  The
financing  was provided at a rate that was below the current  market for similar
financings  and, as such, we reduced the carrying  amounts of the assets and the
debt by $10.9  million to adjust the yield on the debt to current  market terms.
In June 2002, three sales of CMBS in two issues were completed.  The securities,
which had a basis of $31,012,000 including amortization of discounts,  were sold
for $31,371,000 resulting in a net gain of $359,000.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, we purchased  $6,542,000 face amount of
interests in two CMBS issues for $6,157,000.

6.  Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities, continued

At December 31, 2003,  ten CMBS issues with an aggregate  market value of $128.9
million and unrealized  losses of $35.0 million have been in an unrealized  loss
position  for greater  than twelve  months.  We believe  that these market value
losses are  temporary.  We do not expect any actual losses in the classes of the
bonds that we hold and expect the value of the individual bonds will increase as
currently delinquent loans are resolved and the bonds approach maturity.

At December 31, 2003, we have CMBS totaling  $158,136,000 of which  $153,136,000
earn interest  (including  the accretion of the  discounted  purchase  price) at
fixed rates  averaging  11.88% of the book value and $5,000,000 earn interest at
variable rates averaging LIBOR plus 2.95% (4.11% at December 31, 2003). The CMBS
mature at various dates from August 2004 to December 2014. At December 31, 2003,
the expected average life for the CMBS portfolio is 7.8 years.

7.  Loans Receivable

We have classified our loans receivable into the following general categories:

       o      First  Mortgage  Loans - These are  single-property  secured loans
              evidenced by a primary first  mortgage and senior to any mezzanine
              financing and the owner's equity. These loans are bridge loans for
              equity  holders  who require  interim  financing  until  permanent
              financing can be obtained.  Our first mortgage loans are generally
              not intended to be permanent in nature, but rather are intended to
              be of a relatively short-term duration,  with extension options as
              deemed  appropriate,  and typically  require a balloon  payment of
              principal at maturity.  We may also  originate and fund  permanent
              first  mortgage  loans  in  which we  intend  to sell  the  senior
              tranche,  thereby  creating a property  mezzanine loan (as defined
              below).

       o      Property Mezzanine Loans - These are single-property secured loans
              which are subordinate to a primary first mortgage loan, but senior
              to the owner's  equity.  A mezzanine  loan is evidenced by its own
              promissory  note  and  is  typically  made  to  the  owner  of the
              property-owning entity (i.e. the senior loan borrower).  It is not
              secured by the first mortgage on the property,  but by a pledge of
              all  of  the  mezzanine   borrower's  ownership  interest  in  the
              property-owning   entity.   Subject  to   negotiated   contractual
              restrictions,  the  mezzanine  lender  has  the  right,  following
              foreclosure,  to become the sole  indirect  owner of the  property
              subject to the lien of the primary mortgage.

       o      B Notes - These are loans evidenced by a junior participation in a
              first mortgage against a single property; the senior participation
              is known as an A Note.  Although a B Note may be  evidenced by its
              own promissory note, it shares a single borrower and mortgage with
              the A Note and is secured by the same  collateral.  B Note lenders
              have the same  obligations,  collateral and borrower as the A Note
              lender and in most instances are  contractually  limited in rights
              and remedies in the case of a default.  The B Note is  subordinate
              to the A Note by virtue of a contractual arrangement between the A
              Note  lender  and  the B Note  lender.  For the B Note  lender  to
              actively  pursue  a full  range  of  remedies,  it  must,  in most
              instances, purchase the A note.

       o      Corporate  Mezzanine  Loans - These are investments in or loans to
              real  estate-related  operating  companies,  including REITs. Such
              loan  investments  take the form of secured  debt and may finance,
              among  other  things,   operations,   mergers  and   acquisitions,
              management  buy-outs,   recapitalizations,   start-ups  and  stock
              buy-backs  generally involving real estate and real estate-related
              entities.

10.  Long-Term Debt

Credit Facility

Effective  June  27,  2003,  we  entered  into  a new  credit  agreement  with a
commercial lender who has been providing credit to us since June 8, 1998.

The credit facility in effect for the year ended December 31, 2002, provided for
a $100 million line of credit. In connection with the Company's  purchase of the
Fund I interest  held by  affiliates  of Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  in
January 2003,  the Company  assumed the  obligations  under the credit  facility
entered into by Fund I. There were outstanding  borrowings of $24,084,000 on the
date of  acquisition.  The lender for the Fund I credit facility was the same as
the lender for our outstanding  credit facility and thus the two facilities were
combined for reporting  purposes with the line of credit being increased to $150
million.

On June 27,  2003,  we formally  combined  under one  facility  the  outstanding
borrowings of the two  facilities  and extended the maturity of the $150 million
credit  facility for two  additional  years to July 16, 2005,  with an automatic
nine month amortizing  extension option, if not otherwise extended.  We incurred
an initial  commitment fee of $1,425,000  upon the signing of this new agreement
which is being amortized over the remaining term of the agreement.

The credit  facility  provides  for advances to fund  lender-approved  loans and
investments  made by us,  which we refer to as "funded  portfolio  assets".  Our
obligations  under the  credit  facility  are  secured  by pledges of the funded
portfolio assets acquired with advances under the credit facilities.

Borrowings  under the credit  facility  bears  interest at specified  rates over
LIBOR,  which rates may  fluctuate,  based upon the credit quality of the funded
portfolio  assets.  This  facility  is also  subject  to a minimum  usage fee if
average  borrowings for a quarter are less than a threshold  amount.  The credit
facility provides for margin calls on asset-specific  borrowings in the event of
asset quality and/or market value  deterioration  as determined under the credit
facility. The credit facility contains customary representations and warranties,
covenants  and  conditions  and events of default.  The credit  facilities  also
contain a covenant  obligating us to avoid  undergoing an ownership  change that
results in John R. Klopp or Samuel Zell no longer retaining their senior offices
and directorships with us and practical control of our business and operations.

10.  Long-Term Debt, continued

At December 31, 2003, we have borrowed  $38,868,000 under the credit facility at
an average  interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.50% (2.62% at December 31,  2003).  On
December 31, 2003,  the unused  amount of potential  credit under the  remaining
credit facility was $111,132,000.  Assuming no additional  utilization under the
credit facility and including the amortization of fees paid and capitalized over
the term of the credit facility,  the all-in effective  borrowing cost was 4.58%
at December 31, 2003. We have pledged  assets of  $78,022,000  as collateral for
the borrowing against such credit facility.

Term Redeemable Securities Contract

In connection with the purchase of our BB CMBS portfolio as previously described
in Note 6, an affiliate of the seller provided financing for 70% of the purchase
price,  or $137.8  million,  at a floating  rate of LIBOR  plus 50 basis  points
pursuant  to a term  redeemable  securities  contract.  This  rate was below the
market  rate for  similar  financings,  and,  as such,  a  discount  on the term
redeemable  securities  contract was  recorded to reduce the carrying  amount by
$10.9 million  (which has been  amortized to $679,000),  which had the effect of
adjusting the yield to current market terms. The debt had a three-year term that
expired in February 2002.

On February 28, 2002, we entered into a new term redeemable securities contract.
The current term redeemable  securities contract was utilized to finance certain
of the assets that were previously  financed with a maturing credit facility and
term redeemable  securities contract.  The term redeemable  securities contract,
which allows for a maximum financing of $75 million, is recourse to us and has a
two-year term with an automatic  one-year  amortizing  extension  option, if not
otherwise  extended.  We incurred an initial commitment fee of $750,000 upon the
signing  of the term  redeemable  securities  contract  and we pay  interest  at
specified rates over LIBOR. The new term redeemable securities contract contains
customary representations and warranties, covenants and conditions and events of
default.  This term redeemable  securities contract expired on February 28, 2004
and was  repaid  with the  financed  assets  being  financed  under  the  credit
facility.

At December 31, 2003, we have  borrowed  $11,651,000  under the term  redeemable
securities  contract at an average  interest  rate of LIBOR plus 1.91% (3.06% at
December 31, 2003). On December 31, 2003, the unused amount of potential  credit
under the term  redeemable  securities  contract  was  $63,349,000.  Assuming no
additional  utilization  under  the  term  redeemable  securities  contract  and
including the  amortization  of fees paid and  capitalized  over the term of the
term redeemable  securities  contract,  the all-in effective  borrowing cost was
6.41% at December 31, 2003. We have pledged  assets of $17,957,000 as collateral
for the borrowing against such term redeemable securities contract.

Repurchase Obligations

At December 31, 2003, we were obligated to five counterparties  under repurchase
agreements.

The  repurchase  obligation  with the  first  counterparty,  an  affiliate  of a
securities  dealer,  was  utilized to finance CMBS  securities.  At December 31,
2003, we have sold CMBS assets with a book and market value of $151,964,000  and
have a liability to repurchase these assets for $88,365,000 that is non-recourse
to us. This repurchase  obligation had an original one-year term that expired in
February 2003 and was extended  twice to February  2005.  The liability  balance
bears  interest at specified  rates over LIBOR based upon each asset included in
the obligation.

The repurchase  obligation with the second  counterparty,  a securities  dealer,
arose in connection with the purchase of Federal Home Loan Mortgage  Corporation
Gold  available-for-sale  securities.  At December 31,  2003,  we have sold such
assets  with a book and market  value of  $20,052,000  and have a  liability  to
repurchase  these assets for  $19,461,000.  This repurchase  agreement comes due
monthly and has a current  maturity date in March 2004.  The  liability  balance
bears interest at LIBOR.

10.  Long-Term Debt, continued

The repurchase obligation with the third counterparty,  a securities dealer, was
entered  into on May 28,  2003  pursuant  to the  terms of a  master  repurchase
agreement and provides us with the right to finance up to $50,000,000, which was
upsized  to  $100,000,000  in August  2003,  by selling  specific  assets to the
counterparty.  To December 31, 2003,  the master  repurchase  agreement has been
utilized in connection  with the purchase of five loans during 2003. At December
31,  2003,  we have sold loans with a book and market value of  $53,197,000  and
have a  liability  to  repurchase  these  assets  for  $16,982,000.  The  master
repurchase  agreement  terminates on June 1, 2004, with an automatic  nine-month
amortizing  extension option, if not otherwise  extended,  and bears interest at
specified rates over LIBOR based upon each asset included in the obligation.

The repurchase  obligations with the fourth  counterparty,  a securities dealer,
were  entered  into  during  the third  quarter of 2003 in  connection  with the
purchase of a loan and CMBS  securities.  At December 31,  2003,  we have sold a
loan and CMBS with a book and market value of $9,950,000 and have a liability to
repurchase these assets for $8,210,000. The repurchase agreements are matched to
the term of the  underlying  loan and CMBS that mature  between  August 2004 and
January  2005 and bear  interest at  specified  rates over LIBOR based upon each
asset included in the obligation.

The repurchase obligation with the fifth counterparty,  a securities dealer, was
entered into during 2003 in connection  with the purchase of a loan. At December
31, 2003,  we have sold a loan with a book and market value of  $16,325,000  and
have a liability  to  repurchase  this asset for  $13,876,000.  This  repurchase
agreement comes due monthly and has a current maturity date in March 2004.

The  average  borrowing  rate  in  effect  for all  the  repurchase  obligations
outstanding  at December  31, 2003 was LIBOR plus 0.99%  (2.15% at December  31,
2003). Assuming no additional  utilization under the repurchase  obligations and
including the  amortization  of fees paid and  capitalized  over the term of the
repurchase  obligations,  the  all-in  effective  borrowing  cost  was  2.65% at
December 31, 2003.

11.  Derivative Financial Instruments

On January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended
by Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 138, "Accounting for Certain
Derivative  Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities."  Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, as amended,  establishes  accounting and reporting
standards  for  derivative  instruments.  Specifically  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as
either assets or liabilities in the  consolidated  balance sheets and to measure
those instruments at fair value.  Additionally,  the fair value adjustments will
affect  either  shareholders'  equity or net income  depending  on  whether  the
derivative  instrument  qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so,
the nature of the hedging  activity.  As of January 1, 2001, the adoption of the
new  standard  resulted  in an  adjustment  of  $574,000  to  accumulated  other
comprehensive loss and other liabilities.

In the normal course of business,  we are exposed to the effect of interest rate
changes. We limit these risks by following  established risk management policies
and procedures  including  those for the use of  derivatives.  For interest rate
exposures,  derivatives  are used  primarily  to align  rate  movements  between
interest  rates  associated  with our  loans  and other  financial  assets  with
interest  rates on related  debt  financing,  and  manage the cost of  borrowing
obligations.

We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.  Further, we have
a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based
upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the
underlying and offsetting  exposure that the  derivatives are designed to hedge,
we have  not  sustained  a  material  loss  from  those  instruments,  nor do we
anticipate any material  adverse effect on our net income or financial  position
in the future from the use of derivatives.

11.  Derivative Financial Instruments, continued

To manage  interest rate risk, we may employ  options,  forwards,  interest rate
swaps,  caps and floors or a  combination  thereof  depending on the  underlying
exposure.  To reduce overall  interest  cost, we use interest rate  instruments,
typically interest rate swaps, to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to
fixed  rate debt.  Interest  rate  differentials  that  arise  under  these swap
contracts are recognized as interest expense over the life of the contracts.

Financial reporting for hedges  characterized as fair value hedges and cash flow
hedges are different.  For those hedges characterized as a fair value hedge, the
changes in fair value of the hedge and the hedged item are reflected in earnings
each quarter. In the case of the fair value hedges, we are hedging the component
of interest rate risk that can be directly controlled by the hedging instrument,
and it is this portion of the hedged assets that is recognized in earnings.  The
non-hedged balance is classified as an  available-for-sale  security  consistent
with  Statement of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 115,  "Accounting  for
Certain  Investments  in  Debt  and  Equity  Securities,"  and  is  reported  in
accumulated other comprehensive  income. For those hedges  characterized as cash
flow hedges,  the unrealized  gains/losses in the fair value of these hedges are
reported  on  the  balance  sheet  with a  corresponding  adjustment  to  either
accumulated other comprehensive income or to earnings,  depending on the type of
hedging relationship.

We  undertook  the fair value hedge to sustain  the value of our CMBS  holdings.
This fair value  hedge,  when viewed in  conjunction  with the fair value of the
securities,  was intended to sustain the value of those  securities  as interest
rates rise and fall.  During the twelve  months  ended  December  31,  2001,  we
recognized a loss of $5,479,000  for the decrease in the value of the swap which
was  substantially  offset by a gain of  $4,890,000  for the  change in the fair
value of the  securities  attributed to the hedged risk  resulting in a $589,000
charge to unrealized loss on derivative securities on the consolidated statement
of  operations.  During the period from January 1, 2002 to December 20, 2002, we
recognized a loss of $16,234,000 for the decrease in the value of the swap which
was  substantially  offset by a gain of  $15,924,000  for the change in the fair
value of the  securities  attributed to the hedged risk  resulting in a $310,000
charge to unrealized loss on derivative securities on the consolidated statement
of operations.  In conjunction with the sale of the CMBS previously discussed in
Note 5, in order to  maintain  the  effectiveness  of the hedge,  we reduced the
maturity  of the fair  value  hedge  from  December  2014 to  November  2009 and
recognized  a realized  gain for the payments  received  totaling  $940,000.  On
December 23, 2002,  in order to  eliminate  accumulated  earnings and profits in
anticipation  of our  election of REIT status for tax  purposes,  the fair value
hedge was settled resulting in a realized loss of $23.6 million.

We  utilize  cash  flow  hedges  in order to better  control  interest  costs on
variable  rate debt  transactions.  Interest  rate swaps that  convert  variable
payments to fixed payments,  interest rate caps, floors,  collars,  and forwards
are  considered  cash flow  hedges.  During the period  from  January 1, 2002 to
December 20, 2002 and during the year ended December 31, 2001, the fair value of
the cash flow swaps  decreased by $3.3 million and $2.9  million,  respectively,
which was deferred into other comprehensive loss until the cash flow hedges were
settled on  December  23,  2002 and the  settlement  amount of $6.7  million was
recorded as a charge to earnings.

During the period from  January 1, 2002 to December 20, 2002 and during the year
ended  December 31, 2001, we recognized a loss of $62,000 and a gain of $47,000,
respectively  for the change in time value for qualifying  interest rate hedges.
The time value is a component of fair value that must be recognized in earnings,
and is shown in the  consolidated  statement of operations as unrealized loss on
derivative  securities.  When the interest  rate cap was settled on December 23,
2002, we recognized a realized loss of $51,000 on the consolidated  statement of
operations.

In  December  2002,  we  entered  into two new cash flow  hedge  contracts.  The
following  table  summarizes the notional value and fair value of our derivative
financial instruments at December 31, 2003.

</TABLE>

On December 31, 2003,  the  derivative  financial  instruments  were reported at
their fair value as  interest  rate hedge  assets and the  increase  in the fair
value of the cash flow swaps of $168,000 was deferred  into other  comprehensive
loss and will be released to earnings over the remaining lives of the swaps. The
amount of the hedges'  ineffectiveness is immaterial and reported as a component
of interest expense.

Over  time,  the  unrealized   gains  and  losses  held  in  accumulated   other
comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings.  This reclassification is
consistent  with the  timing of when the  hedged  items are also  recognized  in
earnings. Within the next twelve months, we estimate that $3.1 million currently
held in accumulated other  comprehensive  loss will be reclassified to earnings,
with regard to the cash flow hedges.

12.  Convertible Trust Preferred Securities

On July 28, 1998, we privately  placed  originally  issued 150,000 8.25% step up
convertible trust preferred securities  (liquidation amount $1,000 per security)
with an aggregate liquidation amount of $150 million.

The  convertible  trust  preferred  securities  were  originally  issued  by our
consolidated statutory trust subsidiary,  CT Convertible Trust I, referred to as
the "Trust",  and represented an undivided  beneficial interest in the assets of
the  Trust  that  consisted  solely  of our  8.25%  step up  convertible  junior
subordinated  debentures in the aggregate  principal amount of $154,650,000 that
were concurrently sold and originally issued to the Trust.  Distributions on the
convertible trust preferred securities were payable quarterly in arrears on each
calendar  quarter-end  and  correspond  to the payments of interest  made on the
convertible debentures, the sole assets of the Trust. Distributions were payable
only to the extent payments were made in respect to the convertible debentures.

We received  $145,207,000  in net proceeds,  after original issue discount of 3%
from the liquidation  amount of the convertible  trust preferred  securities and
transaction expenses, pursuant to the above transactions, which were used to pay
down our credit  facilities.  The convertible  trust  preferred  securities were
convertible  into  shares of class A common  stock at an  initial  rate of 85.47
shares of class A common stock per $1,000  principal  amount of the  convertible
debentures  held by the Trust (which was  equivalent  to a  conversion  price of
$35.10 per share of class A common stock).

13.  Convertible Trust Preferred Securities, continued

On May 10, 2000, we modified the terms of the $150 million aggregate liquidation
amount   convertible  trust  preferred   securities.   In  connection  with  the
modification,  the then outstanding  convertible trust preferred securities were
canceled and new variable step up convertible trust preferred securities with an
aggregate  liquidation  amount of $150,000,000 were issued to the holders of the
canceled  securities  in  exchange   therefore,   and  the  original  underlying
convertible  debentures  were canceled and new 8.25% step up convertible  junior
subordinated debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $92,524,000 and new
13% step up  non-convertible  junior  subordinated  debentures  in the aggregate
principal  amount of $62,126,000  were issued to the Trust, as the holder of the
canceled  bonds,  in  exchange  therefore.  The  liquidation  amount  of the new
convertible   trust  preferred   securities  was  divided  into  $89,742,000  of
convertible amount and $60,258,000 of non-convertible  amount, the distribution,
redemption and, as applicable, conversion terms of which, mirrored the interest,
redemption  and,  as  applicable,   conversion  terms  of  the  new  convertible
debentures and the new  non-convertible  debentures,  respectively,  held by the
Trust.

Distributions  on the new  convertible  trust  preferred  securities are payable
quarterly in arrears on each calendar quarter-end and correspond to the payments
of  interest  made  on the  new  debentures,  the  sole  assets  of  the  Trust.
Distributions are payable only to the extent payments are made in respect to the
new debentures.  The new convertible trust preferred securities initially bore a
blended coupon rate of 10.16% per annum which rate was to vary as the proportion
of outstanding  convertible  amount to the  outstanding  non-convertible  amount
changes and step up in accordance with the coupon rate step up terms  applicable
to the convertible amount and the non-convertible amount.

The  convertible  amount bore a coupon rate of 8.25% per annum through March 31,
2002 and  increased  on April 1, 2002 to the  greater  of (i)  10.00% per annum,
increasing  by 0.75% on October 1, 2004 and on each October 1 thereafter or (ii)
a percentage per annum equal to the quarterly dividend paid on a share of common
stock  multiplied  by four and  divided by  $21.00.  The  convertible  amount is
convertible  into shares of class A common  stock,  in  increments  of $1,000 in
liquidation  amount,  at a conversion price of $21.00 per share. The convertible
amount is redeemable by us, in whole or in part, on or after September 30, 2004.

Prior to redemption, the non-convertible amount bore a coupon rate of 13.00% per
annum.  On September 30, 2002, the  non-convertible  debentures were redeemed in
full,  utilizing  additional  borrowings on the credit  facility and  repurchase
agreements,  resulting  in a  corresponding  redemption  in full of the  related
non-convertible amount of convertible trust preferred securities.  In connection
with the redemption transaction,  we expensed the remaining unamortized discount
and  fees on the  redeemed  non-convertible  amount  resulting  in  $586,000  of
additional expense for the year ended December 31, 2002.

For financial  reporting  purposes,  the Trust is treated as our subsidiary and,
accordingly,  the  accounts  of the  Trust  are  included  in  our  consolidated
financial  statements.  Intercompany  transactions  between  the  Trust  and us,
including the original  convertible and new debentures,  have been eliminated in
our consolidated financial statements.  The original convertible trust preferred
securities and the new convertible trust preferred securities are presented as a
separate  caption between  liabilities and  shareholders'  equity  ("convertible
trust preferred securities") in our consolidated balance sheet. Distributions on
the original  convertible  trust  preferred  securities and the new  convertible
trust preferred  securities are recorded,  net of the tax benefit, in a separate
caption immediately following the provision for income taxes on our consolidated
statements of operations.

In  accordance  with  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  Financial
Accounting  Standards Board  Interpretation  No. 46,  "Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities,"  beginning January 1, 2004 we will no longer consolidate the
operations of the trust on our financial statements.

13.  Shareholders' Equity

Authorized Capital

We have the authority to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of stock,  consisting of
(i) 100,000,000  shares of class A common stock and (ii)  100,000,000  shares of
preferred  stock.  The  board of  directors  is  generally  authorized  to issue
additional shares of authorized stock without shareholder approval.

Common Stock

Class A common stock are voting shares entitled to vote on all matters presented
to a vote of  shareholders,  except as  provided by law or subject to the voting
rights of any outstanding  preferred stock. Holders of record of shares of class
A common stock on the record date fixed by our board of  directors  are entitled
to receive such  dividends as may be declared by the board of directors  subject
to the rights of the holders of any outstanding preferred stock.

Preferred Stock

In 2001,  we had  outstanding  two  classes  of  preferred  stock,  class A 9.5%
cumulative  convertible  voting  preferred Stock and the class B 9.5% cumulative
convertible   non-voting  preferred  stock.  In  December  2001,  following  the
repurchase  of all of the  outstanding  shares of preferred  stock (as discussed
below),  we amended  our  charter  to  eliminate  from  authorized  capital  the
previously  designated  class A preferred  stock and class B preferred stock and
increase the authorized shares of preferred stock to 100,000,000.

Common and Preferred Stock Transactions

In March 2000, we commenced an open market stock repurchase  program under which
we were  initially  authorized  to  purchase,  from time to time,  up to 666,667
shares  of class A common  stock.  Since  that time the  authorization  has been
increased by the board of directors to purchase up to 2,366,934  shares of class
A common stock. As of December 31, 2003, we had purchased and retired,  pursuant
to the program,  1,700,584 shares of class A common stock at an average price of
$13.13 per share (including commissions).

We have no further  obligations  to issue  additional  warrants to affiliates of
Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  at  December  31,  2003.  The  value of the
warrants  at the  issuance  dates,  $4,636,000,  was  capitalized  and is  being
amortized  over  the  anticipated  lives  of  the  fund  business  venture  with
affiliates  of  Citigroup  Alternative  Investments.  On January  31,  2003,  we
purchased all of the outstanding  warrants to purchase 2,842,822 shares of class
A common stock for $2,132,000.

In two privately  negotiated  transactions  closed in April 2001, we repurchased
for $29,138,000, 210,234 shares of class A common stock, 506,944 shares of Class
B common stock,  506,130 shares of class A Preferred Stock and 758,037 shares of
Class B Preferred  Stock.  In addition,  in a privately  negotiated  transaction
closed in August 2001, we repurchased for $20,896,000,  66,667 shares of class A
common stock,  411,451 shares of Class B common stock, 253,065 shares of class A
Preferred  Stock  and  589,713  shares  of  Class  B  Preferred  Stock.  We have
repurchased all of our previously outstanding Preferred Stock and eliminated the
related dividend.

On June 18,  2003,  we  issued  1,075,000  shares  of class A common  stock in a
private placement.  Thirty-two separate investors,  led by certain institutional
clients advised by Lend Lease Rosen Real Estate  Securities,  LLC, purchased the
shares.  We received net  proceeds of $17.1  million  after  payment of offering
expenses and fees to Conifer Securities, LLC, our placement agent.

15.   Income Taxes

The  Company  intends to make an  election  to be taxed as a REIT under  Section
856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with the tax
year ending  December  31,  2003.  As a REIT,  we  generally  are not subject to
federal income tax. To maintain  qualification  as a REIT, we must distribute at
least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our  stockholders and meet certain other
requirements.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable  year,  we will be
subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular  corporate rates.
We may also be  subject  to  certain  state and local  taxes on our  income  and
property.  Under certain  circumstances,  federal income and excise taxes may be
due on our  undistributed  taxable  income.  At December  31,  2003,  we were in
compliance with all REIT requirements.

During the year ended  December  31,  2003,  we recorded  $646,000 of income tax
expense for income  that was  attributable  to taxable  REIT  subsidiaries.  Our
effective  tax rate for the year ended  December  31, 2003  attributable  to our
taxable REIT  subsidiaries was 107.9%.  The difference  between the U.S. federal
statutory tax rate of 35% and the  effective  tax rate was  primarily  state and
local  taxes,  net of  federal  tax  benefit,  and  compensation  in  excess  of
deductible limits.

We have  federal net  operating  loss  carryforwards  as of December 31, 2003 of
approximately  $12.4  million.  Such net  operating  loss  carryforwards  expire
through  2021.  Due to an  ownership  change in January  1997 and another  prior
ownership change, a substantial  portion of the net operating loss carryforwards
are limited for  federal  income tax  purposes  to  approximately  $1.4  million
annually. Any unused portion of such annual limitation can be carried forward to
future periods.  We also have federal capital loss  carryforwards as of December
31, 2003 of approximately  $29.4 million that expire in 2007. The utilization of
these  carryforwards  would not reduce  federal  income  taxes but would  reduce
required distributions to maintain REIT status.

Deferred  income  taxes  reflect  the net tax effects of  temporary  differences
between the carrying  amounts of assets and liabilities for financial  reporting
purposes and the amounts used for tax reporting purposes.

As we are operating in a manner to meet the qualifications to be taxed as a REIT
for federal  income tax purposes  during the 2003 tax year,  we do not expect we
will be liable for income taxes or taxes on "built-in gain" on our assets at the
federal level or in most states in future years,  other than on our taxable REIT
subsidiary.  Accordingly,  we eliminated  substantially  all of our deferred tax
liabilities  other than that related to our taxable REIT  subsidiary at December
31,  2002.  The amounts for 2003 relate only to  differences  related to taxable
earnings of our taxable REIT subsidiaries.

16.  Employee Benefit Plans

Employee 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan

In 1999,  we  instituted a 401(k) and profit  sharing plan that allows  eligible
employees  to  contribute  up to 15% of their  salary into the plan on a pre-tax
basis,  subject to annual limits. We have committed to make contributions to the
plan  equal to 3% of all  eligible  employees'  compensation  subject  to annual
limits  and  may  make  additional   contributions  based  upon  earnings.   Our
contribution  expense for the years ended December 31, 2003,  2002 and 2001, was
$103,000, $110,000 and $196,000, respectively.

1997 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan

Our 1997 amended and restated  long-term  incentive stock plan permits the grant
of nonqualified  stock option,  incentive stock option,  restricted stock, stock
appreciation right, performance unit, performance stock and stock unit awards. A
maximum  of  147,001  shares of class A common  stock may be issued  during  the
fiscal  year 2004  pursuant  to awards  under the  incentive  stock plan and the
director  stock plan (as discussed  below) in addition to the shares  subject to
awards  outstanding under the two plans at December 31, 2003. The maximum number
of shares that may be subject to awards to any  employee  during the term of the
plan may not exceed 333,334 shares and the maximum amount payable in cash to any
employee with respect to any performance period pursuant to any performance unit
or performance stock award is $1.0 million.

Incentive  stock options shall be exercisable no more than ten years after their
date of grant and five  years  after the grant in the case of a 10%  stockholder
and vest over a period of three years with one-third vesting at each anniversary
date.  Payment of an option may be made with cash, with previously owned class A
common  stock,  by  foregoing   compensation  in  accordance  with   performance
compensation  committee or  compensation  committee rules or by a combination of

Restricted  stock may be granted under the long-term  incentive  stock plan with
performance  goals and  periods of  restriction  as the board of  directors  may
designate.  The  performance  goals may be based on the  attainment  of  certain
objective and/or subjective  measures.  In 2003, 2002 and 2001, we issued 17,500
shares,  25,125 shares and 75,927  shares,  respectively,  of restricted  stock.
12,707 shares were canceled in 2003 and 20,791 shares were canceled in 2001 upon
the  resignation of employees prior to vesting.  The shares of restricted  stock
issued in 2003 vest one-third on each of the following dates:  February 1, 2004,
February 1, 2005 and February 1, 2006. The shares of restricted  stock issued in
2002 vest one-third on each of the following dates:  February 1, 2003,  February
1, 2004 and February 1, 2005. The shares of restricted stock issued in 2001 vest
one-third on each of the following dates: February 1, 2002, February 1, 2003 and
February 1, 2004. We also granted 17,361 shares of performance  based restricted
stock in 1999, which were canceled in 2002.

The long-term  incentive  stock plan also authorizes the grant of stock units at
any time and from time to time on such terms as shall be determined by the board
of  directors  or  administering  compensation  committee.  Stock units shall be
payable in class A common stock upon the occurrence of certain  trigger  events.
The terms and conditions of the trigger events may vary by stock unit award,  by
the participant, or both.

1997 Non-Employee director stock plan

Our 1997 amended and restated non-employee director stock plan permits the grant
of  nonqualified  stock option,  restricted  stock,  stock  appreciation  right,
performance unit,  performance stock and stock unit awards. A maximum of 147,001
shares  of class A common  stock  may be  issued  during  the  fiscal  year 2004
pursuant to awards under the  director  stock plan and the  long-term  incentive
stock plan, in addition to the shares  subject to awards  outstanding  under the
two plans at December 31, 2003.

16.  Employee Benefit Plans, continued

The board of directors  shall  determine the purchase price per share of class A
common stock covered by  nonqualified  stock options  granted under the director
stock plan.  Payment of  nonqualified  stock options may be made with cash, with
previously  owned shares of class A common stock,  by foregoing  compensation in
accordance with board rules or by a combination of these payment methods.  Stock
appreciation  rights may be granted under the plan in lieu of nonqualified stock
options, in addition to nonqualified stock options,  independent of nonqualified
stock  options  or  as a  combination  of  the  foregoing.  A  holder  of  stock
appreciation  rights is  entitled  upon  exercise  to receive  shares of class A
common stock,  or cash or a  combination  of both, as the board of directors may
determine,  equal in value on the date of  exercise  to the  amount by which the
fair market  value of one share of class A common  stock on the date of exercise
exceeds the exercise  price fixed by the board on the date of grant (which price
shall  not be less than  100% of the  market  price of a share of class A common
stock on the date of grant)  multiplied  by the  number of shares in  respect to
which the stock appreciation rights are exercised.

Restricted  stock may be granted under the director stock plan with  performance
goals and periods of restriction  as the board of directors may  designate.  The
performance  goals may be based on the  attainment of certain  objective  and/or
subjective measures.  The director stock plan also authorizes the grant of stock
units at any time and from time to time on such terms as shall be  determined by
the board of directors. Stock units shall be payable in shares of class A common
stock upon the occurrence of certain trigger events. The terms and conditions of
the trigger events may vary by stock unit award, by the participant, or both.

17.  Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The Financial  Accounting  Standards Board's  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 107,  "Disclosures  about Fair Value of  Financial  Instruments,"
requires  disclosure  of fair value  information  about  financial  instruments,
whether or not recognized in the statement of financial condition,  for which it
is practicable  to estimate that value.  In cases where quoted market prices are
not available, fair values are based upon estimates using present value or other
valuation  techniques.  Those  techniques  are  significantly  affected  by  the
assumptions  used,  including the discount  rate and the  estimated  future cash
flows. In that regard,  the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated
by comparison to independent  markets and, in many cases,  could not be realized
in immediate  settlement of the  instrument.  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 107 excludes certain  financial  instruments and all non-financial
instruments from our disclosure  requirements.  Accordingly,  the aggregate fair
value amounts do not represent the underlying value of we.

The following  methods and  assumptions  were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

  Cash and cash  equivalents:  The  carrying  amount  of cash on hand and  money
  market funds is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.

  Available-for-sale  securities:  The fair value was determined  based upon the
  market value of the securities.

  Commercial  mortgage-backed   securities:  The  fair  value  was  obtained  by
  obtaining quotes from a market maker in the security.

  Loans  receivable,  net:  The fair  values  were  estimated  by using  current
  institutional  purchaser  yield  requirements  for loans with  similar  credit
  characteristics.

  Interest  rate cap  agreement:  The fair  value was  estimated  based upon the
  amount at which similar financial instruments would be valued.

  Credit facility:  The credit  facilities are at floating rates of interest for
  which the  spread  over  LIBOR is at rates  that are  similar  to those in the
  market currently.  Therefore,  the carrying value is a reasonable  estimate of
  fair value.

  Repurchase  obligations:  The  repurchase  obligations,  which  are  generally
  short-term in nature, bear interest at a floating rate and the book value is a
  reasonable estimate of fair value.

  Term redeemable  securities contract:  The fair value was estimated based upon
  the amount at which similar  privately placed financial  instruments  would be
  valued.

  Convertible  trust  preferred  securities:  The fair value was estimated based
  upon the amount at which similar privately placed financial  instruments would
  be valued.

  Interest rate swap  agreements:  The fair values were estimated based upon the
  amount at which similar financial instruments would be valued.

Rent expense for office space and equipment  amounted to $902,000,  $899,000 and
$852,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Litigation

In the normal course of business,  we are subject to various  legal  proceedings
and claims,  the resolution of which, in management's  opinion,  will not have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or our results of
operations.

Employment Agreements

We have an employment  agreement with our chief executive  officer that provided
for an initial  five-year  term of  employment  that ended  July 15,  2002.  The
agreement  has  been  automatically  extended  twice  for  one-year  terms,  and
currently ends on July 15, 2004, and contains  extension options that extend the
agreement for  additional  one-year  terms  automatically  unless  terminated by
either party by April 17, 2004. The employment  agreement currently provides for
an annual  base  salary of  $600,000,  subject to  calendar  year cost of living
increases  at the  discretion  of the board of  directors.  The chief  executive
officer is also  entitled to annual  incentive  cash bonuses to be determined by
the board of directors based on individual performance and our profitability and
is a  participant  in our  long-term  incentive  stock  plan and other  employee
benefit plans.

21.  Segment Reporting

We have established two reportable  segments  beginning January 1, 2003. We have
an internal  information system that produces performance and asset data for our
two segments along service lines.

The Balance Sheet Investment  segment includes all of our activities  related to
direct loan and investment  activities  (including direct  investments in Funds)
and the financing thereof.

The Investment  Management  segment  includes all of our  activities  related to
investment   management   services  provided  us  and  third-party  funds  under
management and includes our taxable REIT  subsidiary,  CT Investment  Management
Co., and its subsidiaries.

</TABLE>

All revenues were generated from external sources within the United States.  The
Investment  Management  segment  earned fees of $3,239,000 for management of the
Balance Sheet Investment  segment for the year ended December 31, 2003, which is
reflected as offsetting  adjustments to other revenues and other expenses in the
Inter-Segment Activities column in the tables above.

Prior to January 1, 2003, we managed our  operations  as one segment;  therefore
separate segment  reporting is not presented for 2002 and 2001, as the financial
information for that segment is the same as the information in the  consolidated
financial statements.

22.  Risk Factors

Our assets are subject to various risks that can affect  results,  including the
level and volatility of prevailing  interest rates and credit  spreads,  adverse
changes  in  general   economic   conditions  and  real  estate   markets,   the
deterioration  of credit quality of borrowers and the risks  associated with the
ownership  and  operation of real estate.  Any  significant  compression  of the
spreads  of the  interest  rates  earned  on  interest-earning  assets  over the
interest  rates  paid on  interest-bearing  liabilities  could  have a  material
adverse  effect on our operating  results as could adverse  developments  in the
availability of desirable loan and investment  opportunities  and the ability to
obtain and maintain  targeted  levels of leverage and borrowing  costs.  Adverse
changes  in  national  and  regional  economic  conditions,  including  acts  of
terrorism,  can have an  effect on real  estate  values  increasing  the risk of
undercollateralization  to the extent that the fair market  value of  properties
serving as  collateral  security for our assets are reduced.  Numerous  factors,
such as adverse changes in local market  conditions,  competition,  increases in
operating  expenses and uninsured losses,  can affect a property owner's ability
to maintain  or  increase  revenues  to cover  operating  expenses  and the debt
service on the property's financing and,  consequently,  lead to a deterioration
in credit  quality or a loan  default  and reduce  the value of our  assets.  In
addition,  the yield to  maturity  on our CMBS assets are subject to the default
and loss experience on the underlying mortgage loans, as well as by the rate and
timing of payments of principal.  If there are realized losses on the underlying
loans,  we may not  recover the full  amount,  or  possibly,  any of our initial
investment in the affected CMBS asset.  To the extent there are  prepayments  on
the underlying  mortgage  loans as a result of  refinancing at lower rates,  our
CMBS assets may be retired  substantially  earlier than their stated  maturities
leading to reinvestment in lower yielding assets. There can be no assurance that
our assets will not experience  any of the foregoing  risks or that, as a result
of any such experience,  we will not suffer a reduced return on investment or an
investment loss.
