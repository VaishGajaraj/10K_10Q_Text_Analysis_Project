                                     PART I
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 1.           Business
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General
-------

Capital Trust, Inc. (the "Company") is an investment  management and real estate
finance  company that makes,  for its own account and for funds that it manages,
high-yield  commercial  real estate loans and related  investments.  The Company
serves as the investment manager to CT Mezzanine Partners II LP ("Fund II"), the
largest dedicated  commercial real estate mezzanine  investment fund in the U.S.
with total equity commitments of $845 million. The Company continues to pursue a
transition  from being a balance sheet lender to managing  investments on behalf
of third parties. The Company's transition to an investment manager commenced in
March  2000 when it  entered  into a venture  with  Citigroup  Investments  Inc.
("Citigroup") to co-sponsor, commit to invest capital in, and manage a series of
high-yield commercial real estate mezzanine investment funds.

Business and Investment Strategy
--------------------------------

The  Company's  business  strategy  is to  continue  to  expand  its  investment
management  business by sponsoring  other real estate related  investment  funds
and,  following  the  investment  period for Fund II,  other  investment  funds,
including  commercial  real  estate  mezzanine  investment  funds,  and  thereby
generating additional investment management fees and incentive compensation tied
to the  performance  of the  portfolios of  investments  held by new funds under
management.  The Company  also  continues  to manage its  existing  portfolio of
balance sheet assets originated prior to the Company's  strategic  transition to
the investment  management business and remains positioned to selectively add to
its balance sheet  investments  in a diverse array of real estate and investment
management/finance-related   assets   and   enterprises,   including   operating
companies.  The Company  also  continues  to manage the  portfolio  of loans and
investments held by CT Mezzanine Partners I LLC ("Fund I"), its first commercial
real estate mezzanine investment fund jointly sponsored with Citigroup.

The Company's  current  investment  strategy is to pursue lending and investment
opportunities  designed  to  capitalize  on  inefficiencies  in the real  estate
capital,  mortgage and finance markets. The Company's current investment program
emphasizes  senior and junior  commercial  mortgage  loans,  real estate related
corporate  mezzanine loans,  certificated  mezzanine  investments,  subordinated
interests in commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") and preferred and/or
direct equity investments pursuant to which the "mezzanine" financing or capital
provided by the Company is generally subordinate to third-party  financing,  but
senior to the  owner/operator's  equity  position.  The Company  pursues  market
opportunities,  which,  if carefully  underwritten,  structured  and  monitored,
represent  attractive  investments  that pose  potentially less risk than direct
equity  ownership of real  property.  The Company also  believes  that the rapid
growth of the CMBS  market has given rise to  opportunities  for the  Company to
selectively acquire  non-investment grade classes of such securities,  which the
Company  believes  can be  priced  inefficiently  in terms of their  risk/reward
profile.

The Company funds its business  development and investment  activities with cash
flow  generated  from  operations  and with  borrowings  obtained  under  credit
facilities or pursuant to other financing arrangements. The Company believes its
existing sources of funds are adequate to meet its equity commitments to Fund II
and to fund, as necessary,  new balance sheet loan and investment activity.  The
Company continues to explore alternative sources of capital to fund its business
and investment activities,  including, but not limited to, other joint ventures,
strategic alliances and investment management ventures.

Developments During Fiscal Year 2001
------------------------------------

During  fiscal  year 2001,  the  Company  continued  to operate  and develop its
investment  management  business.  The Company  continued to originate loans and
investments  for  Fund  I  until  the  initial  closing  on  investors'   equity
commitments  to Fund II on April 9, 2001.  During 2001,  Fund I originated  $171
million of loans and investments of which $84 million were sold to Fund II after
its  initial  closing  pursuant  to the  limited  partnership  agreement.  As of
December 31, 2001,  Fund I held $165 million of loans in its  portfolio,  all of
which are performing in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements  except
for one loan for $26.0 million which is in default and for which, beginning June
30, 2001, the accrual of interest was suspended.

During fiscal year 2001, the Company continued the private offering of interests
in Fund II primarily to institutional private equity investors. Fund II effected
closings on April 9 and May 29, 2001, following which the fund completed several
lending and  investment  transactions.  On August 7, 2001,  Fund II effected its
final closing of investors' capital commitments.  As of the final closing,  Fund
II was  capitalized  with total equity  commitments  of $845 million,  including
commitments  (both  limited  partner and general  partner)  from the Company and
Citigroup of $49.7 million and $198.9 million,  respectively. As of December 31,
2001, Fund II held $485 million of loans and  investments in its portfolio,  all
of which are performing in accordance with their loan or other agreements.

The  Company  expects  to earn  approximately  $9.5  million of  management  and
advisory fees annually from its  association  with Fund II during the investment
period. The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary,  CT Investment Management Co. LLC
("CTIMCO"),  serves  as the  investment  manager  to Fund  II and in  connection
therewith  will earn annual  investment  management  fees equal to $8.1  million
during the  investment  period for the fund.  CTIMCO  also  expects to earn $1.4
million of  additional  annual fees from  consulting  services to be rendered to
Fund II's general partner.

Pursuant to the Company's  venture  agreement with  affiliates of Citigroup,  in
2001, the Company  issued stock  purchase  warrants to an affiliate of Citigroup
which may be exercised to purchase a total of 4,278,467 shares of class A common
stock,  par value $0.01 per share  ("Class A Common  Stock").  Combined with the
warrants to purchase 4,250,000 shares previously issued,  warrants to purchase a
total of 8,528,467 shares of Class A Common Stock have been issued to affiliates
of Citigroup.  All such warrants have an exercise price of $5.00 per share,  are
currently exercisable and expire on March 8, 2005.

The Company's total asset base increased from $644.4 million at December 31,
2000 to $678.8 million at December 31, 2001, primarily as a result of purchases
of available-for-sale securities made in response to significant loan
satisfactions to maintain compliance with an exemption from being treated as an
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940-Act").
The Company expects total assets to remain relatively constant, as additional
reductions in loan assets from satisfactions will require the Company to
purchase similar amounts of 1940-Act qualifying assets.

Description of Business
-----------------------

General
-------
The Company is an investment  management  and real estate  finance  company that
makes, for its own account and for funds that it manages,  high-yield commercial
real estate  loans and related  investments.  The Company  recently  entered the
investment management business, marking a shift in business from a balance sheet
lender to that of an investment manager making substantial  co-investments  with
other  investors  in funds  under  management.  The  Company  believes  that the
investment  management  business allows the Company to access the private equity
markets as a source of capital to fund its business  and provides the  potential
for significant  operating leverage allowing the Company to grow earnings and to
increase return on equity without simply  incurring  additional  financial risk.
Fund II, for which CTIMCO serves as investment manager, is the principal vehicle
through which the Company's current  investment program is carried out, although
when  consistent with its obligations to Fund II, the Company may invest for its
own balance sheet.

Real Estate Lending and Investment Market
----------------
The Company  believes  that the  stability of  commercial  real estate  property
markets,  coupled with  fundamental  and  structural  changes in the real estate
capital  markets,  primarily  related  to the  growth in CMBS  issuance  and the
financing parameters related thereto, creates significant opportunities for


                                       2

<PAGE>


companies specializing in commercial real estate lending and investing. The most
significant  structural change is the continuing growth of the securitization of
commercial  mortgage loans,  which results in certain  borrowers being unable or
unwilling to satisfy  inflexible credit rating agency guidelines.  Further,  the
continuing  consolidation  in real  estate  markets  results in a need for fully
integrated   lenders  and  investors   capable  of  originating,   underwriting,
structuring,  managing and retaining real estate risk. The Company believes that
these  significant  fundamental  and structural  changes in the commercial  real
estate capital  markets are creating the need for mezzanine  investment  capital
emphasized in the Company's investment program.

Investment Program
------------------
Whether  through its  investment  management  business,  or as a principal,  the
Company  seeks to generate  returns  from a  portfolio  of  leveraged  loans and
investments.  The Company's current  investment program  emphasizes,  but is not
limited to, the following general categories of real estate and  finance-related
assets:

     o   Mortgage Loans. The Company pursues opportunities to originate and fund
         senior and junior mortgage loans ("Mortgage  Loans") to commercial real
         estate owners and property  developers  who require  interim  financing
         until permanent financing can be obtained. The Company's Mortgage Loans
         are  generally  not intended to be permanent in nature,  but rather are
         intended  to be  relatively  short-term  in  duration,  with  extension
         options as deemed appropriate,  and typically require a balloon payment
         of  principal  at  maturity.  These  types of loans are  intended to be
         higher-yielding  loans with higher interest rates and commitment  fees.
         The Company may also  originate and fund  permanent  Mortgage  Loans in
         which the Company intends to sell the senior tranche,  thereby creating
         a Mezzanine Loan.

     o   Mezzanine Loans. The Company  originates  high-yielding  loans that are
         subordinate to first lien mortgage loans on commercial  real estate and
         are  secured  either  by a second  lien  mortgage  or a  pledge  of the
         ownership   interests  in  the  borrowing  property  owner  ("Mezzanine
         Loans").  Typically,  Mezzanine Loans provide the capital  representing
         the  level  between  60%  and 90% of  property  value.  Generally,  the
         Company's  Mezzanine Loans have a longer anticipated  duration than its
         Mortgage  Loans,  are not  intended to serve as  transitional  mortgage
         financing and can  represent  subordinated  investments  in real estate
         operating  companies  which may take the form of secured  or  unsecured
         debt, preferred stock and other hybrid instruments.

     o   Certificated Mezzanine Investments. The Company purchases high-yielding
         investments  that are subordinate to senior secured loans on commercial
         real estate. Such investments  represent interests in debt service from
         loans secured by the underlying  property or property cash flow and are
         held through a trust and issued in certificate form. These certificated
         investments  carry  substantially  similar terms and risks as Mezzanine
         Loans ("Certificated Mezzanine Investments").

     o   Subordinated   Interests.   The  Company   pursues  rated  and  unrated
         investments in public and private subordinated interests ("Subordinated
         Interests") in commercial  collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs")
         and  other  CMBS.   Subordinated   Interests   represent   the  junior,
         subordinated class which are typically lower rated with  non-investment
         grade  ""BB""  or  "B"  rating  agency   ratings  or  are  the  unrated
         high-yielding credit support class.

     o   Other  Investments.  The  Company  remains  positioned  to  develop  an
         investment   portfolio  of  commercial   real  estate  and   investment
         management/finance-related   assets   meeting  the   Company's   target
         risk/return  profile.  Except  as  limited  by its  role as  investment
         manager to funds  under  management,  the Company is not limited in the
         kinds     of     commercial      real     estate     and     investment
         management/finance-related  assets in which it can  invest  on  balance
         sheet and believes that it is  positioned  to expand  opportunistically
         its  investment  management/finance  business.  The  Company may pursue
         investments  in, among other  assets,  construction  loans,  distressed
         mortgages,  foreign real estate and finance-related  assets,  operating
         companies,  including investment managers and loan origination and loan
         servicing companies,  and fee interests in real property (collectively,
         "Other Investments"). Any such lending may be on a secured or unsecured
         basis  and will be  subject  to risks  similar  to those  attendant  to
         investing in the other categories set forth above.

                                       3


<PAGE>


The Company's current  investment  program emphasizes loans and investments that
provide unleveraged  investment yields within a target range of 500 to 800 basis
points above LIBOR.  The Company may originate or acquire loans and  investments
with yields that fall outside of the foregoing targeted  investment yield range,
but  otherwise  correspond  to the level of risk  perceived by the Company to be
associated  with such loans and  investments.  The Company has no  predetermined
limitations or targets for  concentration of asset type or geographic  location.
Instead of  adhering to any  prescribed  limits or  targets,  the Company  makes
acquisition   decisions  through  asset  and  collateral  analysis,   evaluating
investment risks on a case-by-case basis.

Sources of Financing and Use of Leverage
----------------------------------------

The Company seeks to maximize yield through the use of leverage, consistent with
maintaining an acceptable  level of risk,  and therefore  finances the loans and
investments it holds and manages.  The Company  leverages assets through,  among
other things,  borrowings under credit  facilities,  other secured and unsecured
borrowings,  and financing  obtained through  repurchase  obligations.  When the
expected  benefits  outweigh the risks to the Company,  such borrowings may have
recourse  to the  Company  or the  fund  in the  form  of  guarantees  or  other
obligations. If changes in market conditions cause the cost of such financing to
increase  relative to the income that can be derived from  investments made with
the proceeds thereof, the Company may reduce the amount of leverage it utilizes.
Obtaining  the leverage  required to execute the current  business plan requires
the Company to maintain interest coverage ratios and other covenants mandated by
current market underwriting  standards.  Sources of financing currently employed
by the Company include the following:

     o   Credit Facilities. The Company had two credit facilities under which it
         could  borrow  funds to finance its balance  sheet loan and  investment
         assets. In February 2002, one of the credit facilities  matured and the
         assets  financed  thereon  were  financed  under a new term  redeemable
         securities  contract as described  below.  The  remaining  $100 million
         credit  facility  provides the Company with adequate  liquidity for its
         short-term needs.

     o   Term Redeemable  Securities Contract.  In connection with the Company's
         original purchase of a CMBS portfolio from a commercial lender (the "BB
         CMBS  Portfolio"),  the  Company  obtained  financing  for  70%  of the
         purchase price, or $137.8 million,  at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 50
         basis points pursuant to a term redeemable  securities contract with an
         affiliate  of  the  seller.  Upon  maturity  of  this  term  redeemable
         securities  contract in February 2002,  the Company  entered into a new
         term redeemable  securities contract with the same counterparty,  which
         allows for a maximum financing of $75 million.  The new term redeemable
         securities  contract  has a two-year  term with an  automatic  one-year
         amortizing  extension  option, if not otherwise  extended.  The Company
         also  utilized two new  repurchase  obligation to finance the remaining
         assets financed under the original term redeemable securities contract.

     o   Repurchase  Obligations.  At  December  31,  2001,  the Company had one
         existing repurchase obligation (used to finance the  available-for-sale
         securities  purchased to remain in compliance  with the exemption  from
         being  treated as an  investment  company under the 40-Act) and entered
         into two new  repurchase  obligations  in February  2002 to finance the
         remaining assets from the BB CMBS Portfolio. The Company may enter into
         other such  obligations  under which the Company would sell assets to a
         third party with the commitment that the Company repurchase such assets
         from the  purchaser  at a fixed  price on an  agreed  date.  Repurchase
         obligations may be characterized as loans to the Company from the other
         party,  with  underlying  assets  securing them.  The repurchase  price
         reflects  the  purchase  price plus an agreed  market rate of interest,
         which is generally paid on a monthly basis.

Leverage  creates an  opportunity  for  increased  income,  but at the same time
creates special risks. For example,  leverage magnifies changes in the net worth
of the  Company or funds  under  management.  Although  the amount  owed will be
fixed,  the assets may change in value during the time the debt is  outstanding.
Leverage  creates  interest  expense  that  can  exceed  the  revenues  from the
leveraged  assets. To the extent the rate of return derived from assets acquired
with borrowed  funds exceed the rate of interest  expense  incurred,  net income
will be greater  than if borrowed  funds had not been used.  Conversely,  if the
revenues  from the assets  acquired with  borrowed  funds are not  sufficient to
cover the cost of borrowing,  net income will be less than if borrowed funds had
not been used.

The Company does not intend to exceed for its own balance sheet a debt-to-equity
ratio of 5:1 and there may also be limits to the amount of leverage  that can be
applied to certain  assets.  The Company  expects that future  investment  funds
sponsored by the Company will utilize  leverage to enhance yields,  although the
extent  to  which  leverage  will be  utilized  will  depend  on the  investment
parameters  of the product  offered to  investors.  At December  31,  2001,  the
Company's   debt-to-equity  ratio  (treating  the  Convertible  Trust  Preferred
Securities as a component of equity) was 1.63:1.

Interest Rate Management Techniques
-----------------------------------

The Company has engaged in and will  continue to engage in a variety of interest
rate  management  techniques for the purpose of managing the effective  interest
rate of its assets  and/or  liabilities.  These  techniques  also may be used to
attempt to protect against  declines in the market value of the Company's assets
resulting from general trends in debt markets.  Any such  transaction is subject
to  risks  and may  limit  the  potential  earnings  on loans  and  real  estate
investments.  Such  techniques  include,  but are not limited to,  interest rate
swaps (the  exchange of  fixed-rate  payments and  floating-rate  payments)  and
interest rate caps. The Company employs the use of correlated hedging strategies
to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on its  operations,  including
engaging in interest  rate swaps and interest rate caps to minimize its exposure
to changes in interest rates. The Company has adopted accounting  policies under
which such  derivatives will impact either or both  shareholders'  equity or net
income  depending on the extent to which  components  of interest  rate risk are
hedged.  See  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and
Results of Operations - Adoption of Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards
No. 133."

Competition
-----------

The Company is engaged in a highly  competitive  business.  The Company competes
for loan and  investment  opportunities  with  numerous  public and private real
estate investment vehicles,  including financial  institutions (such as mortgage
banks,  pension  funds,  opportunity  funds and REITs)  and other  institutional
investors,  as well as individuals.  Many competitors are  significantly  larger
than the Company,  have well established operating histories and may have access
to greater capital and other resources.  In addition,  the investment management
industry  is  highly   competitive  and  there  are  numerous   well-established
competitors possessing substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and
other  resources than the Company.  The Company  competes with other  investment
management companies in attracting capital for funds under management.

Government Regulation
---------------------

The Company's activities, including the financing of its operations, are subject
to a variety  of  federal  and state  regulations  such as those  imposed by the
Federal Trade Commission and the Equal Credit  Opportunity  Act. In addition,  a
majority of states have  ceilings on interest  rates  chargeable to customers in
financing transactions.

Employees
---------

As of December 31, 2001, the Company  employed 21 full-time  professionals,  one
part-time  professional  and  seven  other  full-time  employees.  None  of  the
Company's  employees  are  covered  by a  collective  bargaining  agreement  and
management considers the relationship with its employees to be good.

Item 7.       Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
              Results of Operations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

The Company is an investment  management  and real estate  finance  company that
operated  principally  as a balance sheet lender until the  commencement  of its
transition to the investment  management  business in March 2000.  Prior to July
1997,  the Company  operated as a REIT,  originating,  acquiring,  operating and
holding  income-producing  real property and mortgage-related  investments.  The
results for the year ended  December  31, 1999 reflect the  Company's  principal
balance sheet lending  operations.  The results for the years ended December 31,
2001 and 2000 reflect both balance sheet lending and the  investment  management
business.

The  Company is  successor  to  Capital  Trust,  a  California  business  trust,
following  consummation of the  reorganization on January 28, 1999,  pursuant to
which  the  predecessor  ultimately  merged  with and into  the  Company,  which
thereafter  continued as the surviving  Maryland  corporation.  Each outstanding
predecessor  class A common share of beneficial  interest was converted into one
share of class A common  stock,  par  value  $0.01  per  share  ("Class A Common
Stock"),  and each outstanding  predecessor class A 9.5% cumulative  convertible
preferred  share of beneficial  interest was converted into one share of class A
9.5% cumulative convertible preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class A
Preferred  Stock"),  of the  Company.  As a  result,  all  of the  predecessor's
previously  issued  class A common  shares  of  beneficial  interest  have  been
reclassified  as  shares of Class A Common  Stock  and all of the  predecessor's
previously  issued class A preferred  shares of  beneficial  interest  have been
reclassified as shares of Class A Preferred Stock.  Unless the context otherwise
requires,  hereinafter references to the business, assets, liabilities,  capital
structure,   operations  and  affairs  of  the  Company  include  those  of  the
predecessor prior to the reorganization.

At the  December  31,  2001,  2000 and 1999  fiscal  year ends,  the Company had
outstanding  $150  million  aggregate   liquidation   amount  convertible  trust
preferred securities which were originally issued by the Company's  consolidated
statutory trust subsidiary,  CT Convertible Trust I (the "Trust"),  in July 1998
and originally represented an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the
Trust that consisted solely of the Company's  $154,650,000  aggregate  principal
amount  8.25%  step up  convertible  junior  subordinated  debentures  that were
concurrently  issued  and sold to the Trust.  The  convertible  trust  preferred
securities were modified in May 2000 as discussed below.

As part of the Company's transition to the investment  management business,  the
Company  entered into a venture with Citigroup to  co-sponsor,  commit to invest
capital in and manage  high-yield  commercial real estate  mezzanine  investment
funds. Pursuant to the venture agreement, the Company and Citigroup co-sponsored
Fund II, the largest  commercial  real estate  mezzanine  investment fund in the
U.S.  with total  equity  commitments  of $845.2  million,  and made to it total
equity  commitments  of $49.7  million  and $198.9  million,  respectively.  The
Company expects to earn  approximately $9.5 million of management and consulting
fees annually from its  association  with Fund II during the investment  period.
The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary,  CTIMCO, serves as the investment manager
to Fund II and, in connection therewith,  will earn annual investment management
fees equal to $8.1 million  during the  investment  period for the fund.  CTIMCO
also  expects to earn $1.4  million of  additional  annual fees from  consulting
services to be  rendered  to Fund II's  general  partner  during the  investment
period.

In  connection  with  the  organization  of Fund II and in  accordance  with the
venture  agreement,  in 2000,  the Company issued to an affiliate of Citigroup a
warrant to purchase 4,250,000 shares of Class A Common Stock. In connection with
the closings on investor's  equity  commitments to Fund II, in 2001, the Company
issued to an  affiliate of Citigroup  warrants to purchase  4,278,467  shares of
Class A Common Stock.  All such warrants have a $5.00 per share exercise  price,
are currently exercisable and expire on March 8, 2005.

Fund II is now the principal  vehicle  through  which the Company  originates or
acquires  loans  and  investments  in  accordance  with  the  Company's  current
investment program. Now that CTIMCO will conduct the origination and acquisition
activities  on behalf of Fund II, the Company  generally  will not  originate or
acquire  loans or CMBS  directly for its own balance  sheet  portfolio  with the
working capital

                                       9

derived  from  maturing  loans  and  investments.   Since  new  loans  and  CMBS
investments  will be made by  CTIMCO  for  Fund  II,  the  Company  will use its
available working capital to make contributions to Fund II as and when required.
As a result,  if the  amount of the  Company's  maturing  loans and  investments
increases  significantly  before excess  capital is invested in Fund II or other
funds, or otherwise accretively deployed,  the Company may experience shortfalls
in revenues and lower earnings until offsetting  revenues are derived from funds
under  management  or other  sources.  The Company  expects its total  assets to
remain  relatively  constant,  as  additional  reductions  in loan  assets  from
satisfactions  will  require the Company to purchase  similar  amounts of 40-Act
qualifying assets.

Pursuant to the venture  agreement,  the Company agreed, as soon as practicable,
subject to certain conditions,  to take the steps necessary for it to be treated
as a REIT for tax  purposes.  The  earliest  that the  Company  can  qualify for
election  to REIT  status  will be upon filing its tax return for the year ended
December 31, 2002.  Based on the composition of its assets and the nature of its
income,  due  in  significant  part  to  the  successful  implementation  of the
Company's  investment  management  business,  the  Company  does  not  meet  the
qualifications  to elect to be  taxed  as a REIT at this  time.  In light of its
success with its investment management business,  the Company determined that it
was not  advisable at this time to pursue the changes to its business and assets
that would be necessary for it to qualify for taxation as a REIT. Therefore, the
Company requested Citigroup to waive the obligation,  which request was granted.
The Company continues to pursue alternative strategies for tax efficiency.

Balance Sheet Portfolio Developments and Contributions to Funds
---------------------------------------------------------------

In fiscal year 2001,  to  facilitate  compliance  with the 1940 Act, the Company
purchased  $97.5 million of Federal  National  Mortgage  Association  fixed rate
whole  pool  mortgage-backed  securities  that were  subsequently  sold at their
amortized  cost of $97.3 million.  The Company also purchased  $160.4 million of
Federal   Home  Loan   Mortgage   Corporation   Gold   fixed   rate  whole  pool
mortgage-backed  securities.  To finance this purchase, the Company entered into
eight repurchase obligations that mature in March 2002. The Company sold the six
Federal Home Loan Mortgage  Corporation Gold fixed rate securities with a market
value of $152.8  million  at  December  31,  2001 for which  the  Company  has a
liability to repurchase  these assets for $147.9  million.  The interest rate in
effect for the  repurchase  obligations  at  December  31,  2001 was 2.03%.  The
Company  expects to enter  into new  repurchase  obligations  at  maturity.  The
Company also expects to continue such investment activity in the future when and
if  required  for  compliance  purposes.  As a  consequence  of such  investment
activity, the Company will be required to address financial statement effects of
fair value changes in such investments.

Since December 31, 2000,  the Company funded $13.3 million of commitments  under
three existing loans. The Company received full satisfaction of five loans and a
Certificated Mezzanine Investment totaling $118.0 million and partial repayments
on seven loans and a Certificated  Mezzanine  Investment totaling $17.7 million.
At  December  31,  2001,  the Company had  outstanding  loans and CMBS  totaling
approximately  $458  million  and  no  additional  commitments  for  funding  of
outstanding loans.

The Company's investment in Fund I at December 31, 2001 is $25.0 million.  Since
December 31, 2000, the Company has made equity  contributions to Fund I of $25.3
million  and Fund I has  returned  $28.8  million of  equity.  The  Company  has
capitalized  costs of $4,752,000  that are being  amortized over the anticipated
lives of the funds. As of December 31, 2001,  Fund I has  outstanding  loans and
investments  totaling $165.2 million,  all of which are performing in accordance
with the terms of their  agreements  except for one loan for $26.0 million which
is in default and for which,  beginning  June 30, 2001,  the accrual of interest
was suspended.

Since April 9, 2001,  the Company  has made equity  contributions  to Fund II of
$7.1  million  and equity  contributions  to Fund II's  general  partner of $2.7
million.  The Company's  remaining equity  commitment to Fund II and its general
partner is $42.0  million.  The Company has  capitalized  costs of $3.8  million
relating  to the  formation  of  Fund II  that  are  being  amortized  over  the
anticipated  lives of the funds.  The  Company's  investment  in Fund II and its
general partner at December 31, 2001 is $13.2 million.  As of December 31, 2001,
Fund II has outstanding  loans and investments  totaling $485.4 million,  all of
which are performing in accordance with the terms of their agreements.

Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The  Company  reported  net  income  allocable  to  shares  of  Common  Stock of
$8,764,000  for the year ended  December 31, 2001,  an increase of $618,000 from
the net income  allocable to shares of Common Stock of  $8,146,000  for the year
ended  December 31, 2000.  This  increase was  primarily the result of increased
income from equity  investments in the Funds and related  investment  management
and consulting  fees,  reduced  Preferred Stock dividends and a reduction in the
provision for possible credit losses offset by decreased advisory and investment
banking fees and decreased net interest income from loans and other  investments
as the Company continues its transition to the investment  management  business.
The Company  expects  additional  reductions in interest and related income that
may not be offset by increased income from investment management operations.

Interest  and  related  income  from  loans and other  investments  amounted  to
$67,333,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of $20,352,000 from
the $87,685,000  amount for the year ended December 31, 2000.  Average  interest
earning assets  decreased from  approximately  $681.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000 to  approximately  $570.6  million for the year ended December
31, 2001. The average  interest rate earned on such assets  decreased from 12.8%
in 2000 to 11.8% in 2001.  During the year ended  December 31, 2001, the Company
recognized an  additional  $4.8 million on the early  repayment of loans,  while
during the year ended  December 31, 2000,  the Company  recognized an additional
$4.7 million on the early repayment of loans.  Without this additional  interest
income and after  adjustment of the 2000 rates for the effect of recognizing net
swap payments in interest expense rather than interest income,  the earning rate
for 2001 would have been  11.0%  versus  12.2% for 2000.  The  decrease  in such
core-earning  rate is due to a decrease in the average LIBOR rate from 6.41% for
2000 to 3.88% for 2001 for the  assets  earning  interest  based upon a variable
rate.

Interest  and  related  expenses  amounted  to  $26,238,000  for the year  ended
December 31, 2001, a decrease of $10,474,000 from the $36,712,000 amount for the
year ended  December 31, 2000.  The decrease in expense was due to a decrease in
the  amount  of  average   interest   bearing   liabilities   outstanding   from
approximately   $393.2   million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2000  to
approximately  $321.8  million  for the year  ended  December  31,  2001,  and a
decrease in the average rate paid on interest  bearing  liabilities from 9.2% to
8.2% for the same periods,  after adjustment of the 2000 rates for the effect of
recognizing net swap payments in interest  expense rather than interest  income.
The  decrease in the average  rate is not  consistent  with the  decrease in the
average  LIBOR rate for the same  periods due to a change in the mix of interest
bearing  liabilities.  In 2001,  a higher  percentage  of the  interest  bearing
liabilities are at a fixed rate, after adjusting for interest rate swaps, which,
in the current  low LIBOR rate  environment,  are at higher  rates than that for
variable rate interest bearing liabilities.

The Company also utilized  proceeds from the $150.0 million of Convertible Trust
Preferred Securities, which were issued on July 28, 1998 to finance its interest
earning  assets.  During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company
recognized $8,479,000 and $7,921,000,  respectively,  of net expenses related to
its outstanding convertible trust preferred securities. This amount consisted of
distributions to the holders totaling $15,237,000 and $14,246,000, respectively,
and  amortization  of discount  and  origination  costs  totaling  $799,000  and
$799,000, respectively,  during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. This
was partially  offset by a tax benefit of $7,557,000 and  $7,124,000  during the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  As previously disclosed,
the terms of the Convertible Trust Preferred  Securities were modified effective
May 10, 2000. As a result,  the blended rate on such  securities  increased from
8.25% to 10.16% on that date accounting for the increase in expense in 2001.

During the year ended December 31, 2001, other revenues increased  $4,820,000 to
$11,327,000  from  $6,507,000  in the same  period of 2000.  During  the  second
quarter of 2000,  Fund I commenced  operations  and during the second quarter of
2001,  Fund II commenced  operations.  This  increase in other revenue is due to
increased  revenue from the Funds (management and advisory income in addition to
the return on  investment  in the funds)  offset by a reduction  in advisory and
investment  banking  fees  as  the  Company  continues  its  transition  to  the
investment management business.

Investment  management  and  consulting  fees from funds  under  management  has
increased  significantly  since  the  closing  of Fund II.  The  Company  earned
$5,884,000  of  investment  management  fees  from  Fund  II and  $1,015,000  of
consulting fees from Fund II GP in 2001.  These  additional fees account for the
majority of the increase in investment  management and consulting fees from 2000
to 2001.


                                       11


<PAGE>


For the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had earned $2,991,000
and $1,530,000 respectively, on its equity investment in the Funds. The increase
in  income in 2001  versus  2000 was due  primarily  to the  increased  level of
investment in the Funds offset by the suspension of interest on a Fund I asset.

General and administrative  expenses remained relatively consistent amounting to
$15,382,000  for the year ended  December 31, 2001 versus  $15,439,000  for year
ended  December  31,  2000.  In 2000,  as the  Company  transitioned  to its new
investment  management  business,  it incurred one-time expenses of $2.1 million
that were included in general and administrative  expenses. The Company employed
an average of 27  employees  during the year ended  December  31, 2001 verses an
average of 24 employees during the year ended December 31, 2000. The Company had
28 full-time employees and one part-time employee at December 31, 2001.

The decrease in the provision for possible credit losses from $5,478,000 for the
year ended  December 31, 2000 to $748,000  for the year ended  December 31, 2001
was due to the decrease in average earning assets as previously  described.  The
Company did not add to the reserve for possible credit losses during the second,
third or fourth  quarter of 2001 as the  Company  believes  that the  reserve is
adequate  based on the  existing  loans and  investments  in the  balance  sheet
portfolio.

For the year ended  December 31, 2001 and 2000,  the Company  accrued income tax
expense of $16,882,000 and  $17,760,000,  respectively,  for federal,  state and
local income taxes. The decrease (from 50.1% to 48.6%) in the effective tax rate
was primarily due to lower levels of compensation in excess of deductible limits
in the prior year.

The preferred  stock  dividend and dividend  requirement  arose from  previously
issued shares of Class A Preferred Stock. Dividends accrued on these shares at a
rate of 9.5% per annum on a per share  price of $2.69.  In the third  quarter of
1999,  5,946,825  shares of Class A Preferred Stock were converted into an equal
number  of  shares  of Class A Common  Stock  thereby  reducing  the  number  of
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock to 6,320,833 and the dividend  requirement
to $1,615,000 per annum.  In 2001, the remaining  shares of Preferred Stock were
repurchased thereby eliminating the dividend requirement.

Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2000 and 1999
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The  Company  reported  net  income  allocable  to  shares  of  Common  Stock of
$8,146,000 for the year ended  December 31, 2000, a decrease of $6,555,000  from
the net income  allocable to shares of Common Stock of $14,701,000  for the year
ended  December 31, 1999.  This change was primarily the result of a decrease in
advisory and investment banking fees, partially offset by the additional revenue
generated from the investment in and management of Fund I.

Interest  and  related  income  from  loans and other  investments  amounted  to
$87,685,000  for the year ended  December 31, 2000, a decrease of $905,000  from
the  $88,590,000  amount for the year ended  December  31, 1999.  While  average
interest earning assets decreased from approximately $749.7 million for the year
ended  December  31,  1999 to  approximately  $681.5  million for the year ended
December 31, 2000, the interest rate earned on such assets  increased from 11.8%
in 1999 to 12.8% in 2000.  During the year ended  December 31, 2000, the Company
recognized an additional $4,726,000 on the early repayment of seven loans, while
during the year ended  December 31, 1999,  the Company  recognized an additional
$3,976,000 on the early repayment of five loans. Also in 2000, two loans were in
non-accrual status, which reduced interest income by $867,000 for the year ended
December  31, 2000.  Without  this  additional  interest  income  (offset by the
forgone  interest on the non-accrual  loans in 2000),  the earning rate for 2000
would have been 12.3% versus 11.3% for 1999.  This  increase is due primarily to
an increase in the average LIBOR rate from 5.25% for 1999 to 6.41% for 2000.

Interest  and  related  expenses  amounted  to  $36,712,000  for the year  ended
December 31, 2000, a decrease of $2,742,000 over the $39,454,000  amount for the
year ended  December 31, 1999.  The decrease in expense was due to a decrease in
the  amount  of  average   interest   bearing   liabilities   outstanding   from
approximately   $471.8   million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  1999  to
approximately  $393.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, offset by an
increase in the average rate paid on interest  bearing  liabilities from 8.3% to
9.3% for the same periods.  The increase in the average rate is consistent  with
the  increase  in the  average  LIBOR  rate  for  the  Company's  variable  rate
liabilities for the same periods.

During the years  ended  December  31,  2000 and 1999,  the  Company  recognized
$7,921,000  and  $6,966,000,  respectively,  of  net  expenses  related  to  the
Convertible Trust Preferred  Securities.  This amount consisted of distributions
to  the  holders  totaling  $14,246,000  and  $12,375,000,   respectively,   and
amortization of discount and origination  costs totaling  $799,000 and $799,000,
respectively,  during  the years  ended  December  31,  2000 and 1999.  This was
partially offset by a tax benefit of $7,124,000 and $6,208,000  during the years
ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase in the amount from
1999 to 2000 was due to the  previously  discussed  increase in the rate paid on
the securities from 8.25% to 10.16% effective May 10, 2000.

During the year ended December 31, 2000, other revenues decreased $12,549,000 to
$6,507,000  from  $19,056,000  in the same  period of 1999.  This  decrease  was
primarily due to the reduction in advisory and investment banking fees generated
by Victor Capital and its related  subsidiaries.  The  significant  reduction in
resources devoted to the Company's  investment  banking and advisory  operations
following the transition to its new investment  management  business  during the
second  quarter  of 2000  when  Fund I  commenced  operations,  which  generated
$1,530,000 of income on the Company's  equity  investment in Fund I and $373,000
of investment management fees in 2000.

Other expenses  decreased from  $22,130,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999
to $22,038,000 for year ended December 31, 2000. As the Company  transitioned to
its new investment  management  business,  it incurred one-time expenses of $2.1
million that were included in general and administrative  expenses and wrote-off
the remaining  $275,000 of the excess of purchase  price for Victor Capital over
net tangible  assets  acquired,  net. When these special  one-time  expenses are
removed  from  other  expenses,  recurring  other  expenses  for the year  ended
December 31, 2000 decreased $2.5 million from the same period in the prior year.
During March 1999, to reduce general and  administrative  expenses to a level in
line with  budgeted  business  activity,  the Company  reduced its  workforce by
approximately 30% and recorded a restructuring  charge of $650,000.  This, along
with a decrease in average staffing levels, primarily accounted for the decrease
in  recurring  general  and  administrative  expenses.  During the period  ended
December  31,  2000,  the  Company had an average of 24 full time  employees  as
compared to an average of 34 during the period  ended  December  31,  1999.  The
increase in the provision for possible  credit  losses from  $4,103,000  for the
year ended  December 31, 1999 to $5,478,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000
was due to additional  reserves taken for  non-performing  loans at December 31,
2000.

For the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,  the Company  accrued income tax
expense of $17,760,000 and  $22,020,000,  respectively,  for federal,  state and
local income taxes. The increase in the effective tax rate (from 47.8% to 50.1%)
was  primarily  due to higher  levels of  compensation  in excess of  deductible
limits.

The preferred stock dividend and dividend  requirement arose in 1997 as a result
of the Company's  issuance of $33 million of Class A Preferred Stock on July 15,
1997.  Dividends  accrued  on these  shares at a rate of 9.5% per annum on a per
share price of $2.69 for the  12,267,658  shares  outstanding  or $3,135,000 per
annum through the second quarter of 1999. As discussed  above,  5,946,825 shares
of Preferred Stock were converted into an equal number of shares of Common Stock
during the third  quarter of 1999  thereby  reducing  the number of  outstanding
shares  of  Preferred  Stock  to  6,320,833  and  the  dividend  requirement  to
$1,615,000 per annum.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
-------------------------------

At December 31, 2001, the Company had  $11,651,000 in cash. The primary  sources
of liquidity for the Company for 2002 will be cash on hand,  cash generated from
operations,  principal and interest  payments  received on loans and investments
(including  loan  repayments  and the  return  of  capital  from  Fund  I),  and
additional  borrowings  under  the  Company's  credit  facilities.  The  Company
believes these sources of capital will adequately meet future cash requirements.
The Company  expects that during 2002, it will use a  significant  amount of its
available  capital  resources to satisfy its capital  contributions  required in
connection  with its remaining  $42.0 million equity  commitment to Fund II. The
Company  intends to continue to employ  leverage on its existing  balance  sheet
assets to enhance its return on equity.

The Company  experienced  a net  increase in cash of $263,000 for the year ended
December 31,  2001,  compared to the net  decrease of  $27,394,000  for the year
ended  December  31,  2000.  The use of cash in 2000  was  primarily  to  reduce
liabilities and fund equity  contributions to Fund I. Cash provided by operating
activities during the year ended December 31, 2001 was $12,769,000,  compared to
$11,878,000  during the same  period of 2000.  For the year ended  December  31,
2001,  cash  used  in  investing   activities  was   $40,034,000,   compared  to
$155,552,000  provided by investing  activities  during the same period in 2000.
This change was primarily due to the purchase of  available-for-sale  securities
in 2001. The Company utilized the cash received on loan repayments in both years
to reduce  borrowings  under its credit  facilities and entered into  repurchase
obligations  to finance the  purchase  of  available-for-sale  securities  which
accounted  for the majority of the  $222,352,000  change in the net cash used in
financing  activities  from  $194,824,000  in  2000 to the  $27,528,000  of cash
provided by financing activities in the same period of 2001.

In 2000,  the Company  announced an open market share  repurchase  program under
which the Company may purchase,  from time to time, up to four million shares of
the Company's Class A Common Stock. During fiscal year 2001, the Company did not
purchase any additional shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock pursuant to
the  repurchase  program and has  1,435,600  shares  authorized  for  repurchase
remaining  under the  program.  However,  during  fiscal year 2001,  the Company
repurchased  830,701 shares of Class A Common Stock,  all 2,755,186  outstanding
shares of Class B Common Stock and all 6,320,833 outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock in three  privately  negotiated  transactions.  The  Company  has and will
continue to fund share repurchases with available cash.

At  December  31,  2001,  the Company  was party to two credit  facilities  with
commercial  lenders  that  provide  for a total of $455  million of credit.  One
facility  provided  for a $355  million  line of credit that matured in February
2002.  The other  facility  provides for an existing $100 million line of credit
that matures in July 2002,  with an automatic  nine-month  amortizing  extension
option,  if not  otherwise  extended.  At  December  31,  2001,  the Company had
outstanding  borrowings  under the credit  facilities of  $121,211,000,  and had
unused potential credit of $319,765,000.  The decrease in the amount outstanding
under the credit facilities from the amount outstanding at December 31, 2000 was
due to the use of cash  received  on loan  repayments  to pay  down  the  credit
facilities  offset by additional  borrowings to  repurchase  stock.  In February
2002, the $355 million credit facility  matured and the assets financed  thereon
were  financed  under a new term  redeemable  securities  contract as  described
below.  The remaining  $100 million  credit  facility  provides the Company with
adequate liquidity for its short-term needs.

The existing credit facility provides for advances to fund lender-approved loans
and  investments  made by the Company.  The obligations of the Company under the
credit  facility are required to be secured by pledges of the assets  originated
or acquired by the Company with advances under the credit  facility.  Borrowings
under the credit  facility  bear interest at specified  rates over LIBOR,  which
rates may fluctuate, based upon the credit quality of the pledged assets. Future
repayments  and  redrawdowns of amounts  previously  subject to the drawdown fee
will not require the Company to pay any  additional  fees.  The credit  facility
provides for margin  calls on  asset-specific  borrowings  in the event of asset
quality  and/or  market  value  deterioration  as  determined  under the  credit
facility. The credit facility contains customary representations and warranties,
covenants and conditions and events of default.

At December 31,  2001,  the Company  also has one  outstanding  note payable for
$977,000,  outstanding  borrowings on its term redeemable securities contract of
$137,132,000  and  outstanding  repurchase   obligations  of  $147,880,000.   In
connection  with the  maturity of the credit  facility  and the term  redeemable
securities  contract  in February  2002,  the  Company  entered  into a new term
redeemable  securities  contract with the same counterparty,  which allows for a
maximum financing of $75 million.  The new term

                                       14

<PAGE>


redeemable  securities  contract has a two-year term with an automatic  one-year
amortizing extension option, if not otherwise extended. The Company also entered
into two new  repurchase  obligations  with new  counterparties  to finance  the
remaining assets financed under the original term redeemable securities contract
in February 2002.

The Company's  convertible trust preferred  securities were modified in May 2000
in a transaction pursuant to which the outstanding  securities were canceled and
new variable step up convertible  trust  preferred  securities with an aggregate
liquidation amount of $150 million  ("Convertible  Trust Preferred  Securities")
were issued to the holders of the canceled securities in exchange therefore, and
the original underlying  convertible debentures were canceled and new 8.25% step
up convertible junior subordinated  debentures in the aggregate principal amount
of   $92,524,000   (the   "Convertible   Debentures")   and  new  13%   step  up
non-convertible junior subordinated debentures in the aggregate principal amount
of  $62,126,000  (the   "Non-Convertible   Debentures"  and  together  with  the
Convertible  Debentures,  the  "Debentures")  were  issued to the Trust,  as the
holder of the canceled bonds, in exchange  therefore.  The liquidation amount of
the  Convertible  Trust  Preferred  Securities  is divided into  $89,742,000  of
convertible amount (the "Convertible Amount") and $60,258,000 of non-convertible
amount (the  "Non-Convertible  Amount"),  the  distribution,  redemption and, as
applicable,  conversion terms of which, mirror the interest,  redemption and, as
applicable,   the  conversion  terms  of  the  Convertible  Debentures  and  the
Non-Convertible Debentures, respectively, held by the Trust.

Distributions  on  the  Convertible  Trust  Preferred   Securities  are  payable
quarterly in arrears on each calendar quarter-end and correspond to the payments
of interest made on the Debentures,  the sole assets of the Trust. Distributions
are payable only to the extent  payments are made in respect to the  Debentures.
The Convertible Trust Preferred  Securities initially bear a blended coupon rate
of 10.16% per annum which rate will vary as the  proportion  of the  outstanding
Convertible  Amount to the outstanding  Non-Convertible  Amount changes and will
step up in  accordance  with the  coupon  rate step up terms  applicable  to the
Convertible Amount and the Non-Convertible Amount.

The Convertible  Amount bears a coupon rate of 8.25% per annum through March 31,
2002 and  increases  on April 1, 2002 to the  greater  of (i)  10.00% per annum,
increasing  by 0.75% on October 1, 2004 and on each October 1 thereafter or (ii)
a percentage  per annum equal to the  quarterly  dividend paid on a common share
multiplied by four and divided by $7.00.  The Convertible  Amount is convertible
into shares of Class A Common  Stock,  in  increments  of $1,000 in  liquidation
amount,  at a conversion  price of $7.00 per share.  The  Convertible  Amount is
redeemable by the Company,  in whole or in part, on or after September 30, 2004.
The  Non-Convertible  Amount  bears a coupon  rate of 13.00%  per annum  through
September 30, 2004, increasing by 0.75% on October 1, 2004 and on each October 1
thereafter. The Non-Convertible Amount is redeemable by the Company, in whole or
in part, at any time.

Adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
---------------------------------------------------------------

On January 1, 2001,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities,"  as amended by SFAS No. 138,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Derivative
Instruments  and  Certain  Hedging   Activities."  SFAS  No.  133,  as  amended,
establishes  accounting  and  reporting  standards for  derivative  instruments.
Specifically  SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize  all  derivatives  as
either assets or liabilities in the  consolidated  balance sheets and to measure
those instruments at fair value.  Additionally,  the fair value adjustments will
affect  either  shareholders'  equity or net income  depending  on  whether  the
derivative  instrument  qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so,
the nature of the hedging  activity.  As of January 1, 2001, the adoption of the
new  standard  results  in  an  adjustment  of  $574,000  to  accumulated  other
comprehensive loss.

Financial reporting for hedges  characterized as fair value hedges and cash flow
hedges are different.  For those hedges characterized as a fair value hedge, the
changes in fair value of the hedge and the hedged item are reflected in earnings
each  quarter.  In the case of the fair value hedge,  the Company is hedging the
component of interest  rate risk that can be directly  controlled by the hedging
instrument,  and it is this portion of the hedged  assets that is  recognized in
earnings. The non-hedged balance is classified as an available-for-sale security
consistent with SFAS No. 115, and is reported in accumulated other comprehensive
income.  For those  hedges  characterized  as cash flow hedges,  the  unrealized
gains/losses in the fair value of these hedges are reported on the balance sheet
with a corresponding adjustment to either accumulated other comprehensive income
or in earnings,  depending on the type of hedging  relationship.  In

                                       15

<PAGE>


accordance  with SFAS No. 133, on December 31, 2001,  the  derivative  financial
instruments  were reported at their fair value as other assets and interest rate
hedge liabilities of $82,000 and $9,987,000, respectively.

The  Company is exposed to credit  loss in the event of  non-performance  by the
counterparties  (banks  whose  securities  are  rated  investment  grade) to the
interest  rate swap and cap  agreements,  although it does not  anticipate  such
non-performance.  The  counterparties  would bear the interest rate risk of such
transactions  as market  interest  rates  increase.  If an interest rate swap or
interest rate cap is sold or terminated  and cash is received or paid,  the gain
or loss is deferred and recognized when the hedged asset is sold or matures.

Impact of September 11, 2001 and Terrorism Insurance
----------------------------------------------------

The terrorist  attacks on The World Trade Centers in New York City, the Pentagon
in Washington,  D.C. and in  Pennsylvania  on September 11, 2001, have disrupted
the U.S.  Financial  markets and have  negatively  impacted the U.S.  economy in
general.  Any future terrorist attacks and the anticipation of any such attacks,
or the  consequences  of the  military  or other  response  by the U.S.  and its
allies,  may have a further adverse impact on the U.S. financial markets and the
economy.  It is not  possible  to predict  the  severity of the effect that such
future events would have on the U.S. financial markets and economy.

Although  it is too early to  determine  fully how these  events will impact the
Company,  it is possible that the economic impact of the terrorist  attacks will
adversely  affect  the  credit  quality  of  some  of the  Company's  loans  and
investments. Some of the Company's loans and investments are more susceptible to
the adverse effects than others,  such as the hotel loans,  which  experienced a
significant  reduction  in occupancy  rates  following  the  attacks.  While the
Company's  asset  base is  diversified  and the  Company  employs a  variety  of
techniques to enhance the credit  quality of the assets,  such as dedicated cash
reserves,  letters of credit and guarantees,  the Company may suffer losses as a
result of the  adverse  impact of the  attacks,  or of future  attacks and these
losses may adversely impact the Company's financial performance.

In addition,  the events of September  11 have created  significant  uncertainty
regarding  the ability of real estate  owners of high  profile  assets to obtain
insurance  coverage  protecting  against a  terrorist  attacks  at  commercially
reasonable  rates,  if at all.  The issue is  exacerbated  by the fact that most
insurance  policies (and the terrorism  insurance that has traditionally  been a
part of such policies) expire on December 31 of each year and most secured loans
typically require  comprehensive  terrorism  insurance.  The absence of suitable
insurance  coverage will likely affect the general real estate  lending  market,
lending  volume  and the  market's  overall  liquidity.  In  turn,  real  estate
valuations may be impacted,  particularly  for asset types seen as vulnerable to
attack, including:  central business district office buildings, certain regional
malls and  assets  located  near sites  perceived  as  high-risk  being the most
sensitive.  The lack of  resolution  regarding  affordable  long-term  terrorism
insurance coverage for all property types combined with the general slow-down of
the U.S.  economy may negatively  impact  existing loans and investments and may
reduce the number of suitable investment  opportunities available to Fund II and
the pace at which its  investments  are made. A reduction in asset  originations
could adversely affect the Company's ability to grow earnings.

Impact of Inflation
-------------------

The Company's  operating  results depend in part on the  difference  between the
interest income earned on its  interest-earning  assets and the interest expense
incurred in connection  with its  interest-bearing  liabilities.  Changes in the
general level of interest rates prevailing in the economy in response to changes
in the rate of  inflation  or  otherwise  can  affect  the  Company's  income by
affecting  the  spread  between  the  Company's   interest-earning   assets  and
interest-bearing  liabilities,  as well as, among other things, the value of the
Company's interest-earning assets and its ability to realize gains from the sale
of  assets  and the  average  life  of the  Company's  interest-earning  assets.
Interest  rates are highly  sensitive to many  factors,  including  governmental
monetary and tax  policies,  domestic and  international  economic and political
considerations, and other factors beyond the control of the Company. The Company
employs the use of correlated hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes
in interest rates on its operations,  including  engaging in interest rate swaps
and interest  rate caps to minimize  its exposure to changes in interest  rates.
There can be no assurance  that the Company will be able to  adequately  protect
against the  foregoing  risks or that the  Company  will  ultimately  realize an
economic benefit from any hedging contract into which it enters.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The principal objective of the Company's  asset/liability  management activities
is to maximize net interest  income,  while  minimizing  levels of interest rate
risk.  Net  interest  income and  interest  expense  are  subject to the risk of
interest rate  fluctuations.  To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest
rates,  the Company uses interest rate swaps to  effectively  convert fixed rate
assets  to  variable  rate  assets  for  proper   matching  with  variable  rate
liabilities and variable rate  liabilities to fixed rate  liabilities for proper
matching with fixed rate assets. Each derivative used as a hedge is matched with
an asset or liability with which it has a high correlation.  The swap agreements
are generally held to maturity and the Company does not use derivative financial
instruments  for trading  purposes.  The  Company  uses  interest  rate swaps to
effectively  convert  variable  rate debt to fixed  rate  debt for the  financed
portion of fixed rate assets.  The  differential to be paid or received on these
agreements is recognized  as an  adjustment to the interest  expense  related to
debt and is recognized on the accrual basis.

The  following  table  provides   information  about  the  Company's   financial
instruments  that are  sensitive  to changes in interest  rates at December  31,
2001. For financial assets and debt  obligations,  the table presents cash flows
to the  expected  maturity and weighted  average  interest  rates based upon the
current  carrying values.  For interest rate swaps, the table presents  notional
amounts and weighted  average fixed pay and variable  receive  interest rates by
contractual  maturity  dates.   Notional  amounts  are  used  to  calculate  the
contractual  cash flows to be  exchanged  under the  contract.  Weighted-average
variable rates are based on rates in effect as of the reporting date.

                         Report of Independent Auditors




The Board of Directors
Capital Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Capital Trust,
Inc. and Subsidiaries  (the "Company") as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
related  consolidated  statements of operations,  stockholders'  equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December 31, 2001.  These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the consolidated  financial  position of the Company at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31,
2001, in conformity with accounting  principles generally accepted in the United
States.

1.  Organization

Capital Trust, Inc. (the "Company") is an investment  management and real estate
finance  company  designed  to  take  advantage  of  high-yielding  lending  and
investment  opportunities  in  commercial  real estate and related  assets.  The
Company's  business strategy is to continue to expand its investment  management
business by sponsoring other real estate related investment funds. The Company's
current  investment  program  emphasizes senior and junior  commercial  mortgage
loans,  certificated  mezzanine  investments,   direct  equity  investments  and
subordinated  interests in commercial  mortgage-backed  securities ("CMBS"). The
Company also continues to manage its existing  portfolio of balance sheet assets
originated  prior  to the  Company's  transition  to the  investment  management
business.

The  Company is  successor  to  Capital  Trust,  a  California  business  trust,
following  consummation of the  reorganization on January 28, 1999,  pursuant to
which  the  predecessor  ultimately  merged  with and into  the  Company,  which
thereafter  continued as the surviving  Maryland  corporation.  Each outstanding
predecessor  class A common share of beneficial  interest was converted into one
share of class A common  stock,  par  value  $0.01  per  share  ("Class A Common
Stock"),  and each outstanding  predecessor class A 9.5% cumulative  convertible
preferred  share of beneficial  interest was converted into one share of class A
9.5% cumulative convertible preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class A
Preferred  Stock"),  of the  Company.  As a  result,  all  of the  predecessor's
previously  issued  class A common  shares  of  beneficial  interest  have  been
reclassified  as  shares of Class A Common  Stock  and all of the  predecessor's
previously  issued class A preferred  shares of  beneficial  interest  have been
reclassified as shares of Class A Preferred Stock.  Unless the context otherwise
requires,  hereinafter references to the business, assets, liabilities,  capital
structure,   operations  and  affairs  of  the  Company  include  those  of  the
predecessor prior to the reorganization.

2.  Venture with Citigroup Investments Inc.

As part of the Company's transition to the investment  management  business,  on
March 8, 2000, the Company  entered into a venture with  affiliates of Citigroup
Investments Inc. (collectively "Citigroup") pursuant to which they agreed, among
other things, to co-sponsor, commit to invest capital in, and manage a series of
high-yield commercial real estate mezzanine investment opportunity funds.

Pursuant to the governing venture agreement, the Company and Citigroup formed CT
Mezzanine  Partners  I LLC  ("Fund  I") in  March  2000,  to  which a  Citigroup
affiliate and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, as members thereof, made
capital commitments of $150 million and $50 million,  respectively.  Pursuant to
the  venture  agreement,  the  Company  and  Citigroup  co-sponsored  the second
commercial real estate mezzanine  investment  fund, CT Mezzanine  Partners II LP
("Fund II"),  which  effected its final closing on third party  investor  equity
commitments  in August  2001.  Fund II has total  equity  commitments  of $845.2
million  including  $49.7  million  and $198.9  million  made by the Company and
Citigroup, respectively. A wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, CT Investment
Management Co., LLC ("CTIMCO"),  serves as the exclusive  investment  manager to
Fund I and Fund II.

Based upon the $845.2 million aggregate capital  commitments made at the initial
and subsequent closings,  the Company expects to earn approximately $9.5 million
of  management  and advisory fees  annually  from its  association  with Fund II
during the investment period. CTIMCO serves as the investment manager to Fund II
and in connection therewith will earn annual investment management fees equal to
$8.1 million during the investment  period for the fund.  CTIMCO also expects to
earn $1.4  million of  additional  annual  fees from  consulting  services to be
rendered to Fund II's general partner.

In connection  with the  organization of Fund I, the Company issued a warrant to
purchase  4.25 million  shares of Class A Common Stock.  In connection  with the
closings  on  investor  equity  commitments  to Fund II, the  Company  issued to
Citigroup  warrants to purchase 4,278,467 shares of its Class A Common Stock. In
total,  the Company has issued to Citigroup four warrants to purchase  8,528,467
shares of its Class A Common Stock which have a $5.00 per share exercise  price,
are  currently  exercisable  and expire on March 8,  2005.  The  Company  has no
further  obligations to issue  additional  warrants to Citigroup at December 31,
2001.

3.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the
Company,  CTIMCO (as described in Note 2) CT-F1,  LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary
and direct  member and equity  owner of Fund I),  CT-F2-LP,  LLC (a wholly owned
subsidiary  and  limited  partner  of Fund II),  CT-F2-GP,  LLC (a wholly  owned
subsidiary  and direct  member and equity  owner of Fund II GP),  CT-BB  Funding
Corp. (a wholly owned  subsidiary  which  purchased  fifteen CMBS  securities as

Funding  I, Inc.  (a wholly  owned  single  purpose  subsidiary  which  held one
Mortgage Loan) and VIC, Inc., which together with the Company wholly owns Victor
Capital Group, L.P. ("Victor Capital") and other related subsidiaries including:
VCG Montreal  Management,  Inc.,  Victor Asset Management  Partners,  L.L.C., VP
Metropolis   Services,   L.L.C.,  and  970  Management,   LLC.  All  significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

During the year ended  December 31, 2000,  the Company  dissolved  the following
subsidiaries: Natrest Funding I, Inc., Victor Asset Management Partners, L.L.C.,
VP Metropolis Services, L.L.C., and 970 Management, LLC.

Revenue Recognition

Interest  income for the Company's  mortgage and other loans and  investments is
recognized over the life of the investment  using the effective  interest method
and recognized on the accrual basis.

Fees received in connection with loan commitments,  net of direct expenses,  are
deferred until the loan is advanced and are then recognized over the term of the
loan as an  adjustment  to yield.  Fees on  commitments  that expire  unused are
recognized at expiration.  Anticipated  exit fees are also  recognized  over the
term of the loan as an adjustment to yield.

Income  recognition is generally  suspended for loans at the earlier of the date
at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in the opinion of management,
a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful.  Income recognition is
resumed  when  the  loan  becomes   contractually  current  and  performance  is
demonstrated to be resumed.

Fees from  investment  management  services  are  recognized  when  earned on an
accrual basis. Fees from professional advisory services are generally recognized
at  the  point  at  which  all  Company  services  have  been  performed  and no
significant  contingencies  exist with respect to entitlement  to payment.  Fees
from asset management services are recognized as services are rendered.

Reserve for Possible Credit Losses

The provision for possible credit losses is the charge to income to increase the
reserve for possible credit losses to the level that management  estimates to be
adequate  considering  delinquencies,  loss  experience and collateral  quality.
Other   factors   considered   relate   to   geographic   trends   and   product
diversification,  the size of the  portfolio  and current  economic  conditions.
Based upon these  factors,  the Company  establishes  the provision for possible
credit losses by category of asset. When it is probable that the Company will be
unable to collect  all amounts  contractually  due,  the  account is  considered
impaired.  Where impairment is indicated, a valuation write-down or write-off is
measured  based upon the excess of the recorded  investment  amount over the net
fair  value of the  collateral,  as reduced by  selling  costs.  Any  deficiency
between the carrying  amount of an asset and the net sales price of  repossessed
collateral is charged to the reserve for credit losses.

3.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company  classifies  highly liquid  investments with original  maturities of
three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents.  At December
31, 2001,  cash  equivalents  of  approximately  $11.9  million  consisted of an
overnight  investment in JP Morgan  commercial paper. At December 31, 2000, cash
equivalents of approximately $11.4 million consisted of an investment in a money
market  fund that  invests  in U.S.  Treasury  bills.  The  Company  had no bank
balances in excess of federally  insured  amounts at December 31, 2001 and 2000.
The Company has not  experienced any losses on its demand  deposits,  commercial
paper or money market investments.

Available-for-Sale Securities

Available-for-sale  securities are reported on the consolidated balance sheet at
fair value  with any  corresponding  temporary  change in value  reported  as an
unrealized  gain or loss  (if  assessed  to be  temporary),  as a  component  of
comprehensive income in stockholders' equity, net of related income taxes.

 Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities ("CMBS")

Commercial  mortgage-backed  securities  available-for-sale  are reported on the
consolidated  balance  sheets at fair  value  with any  corresponding  temporary
change in value  resulting  in an  unrealized  gain/(loss)  being  reported as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive  income/(loss) in the stockholders'
equity section of the balance sheet, net of related income taxes.

Income from CMBS is recognized based on the effective  interest method using the
anticipated  yield over the expected life of the  investments.  Changes in yield
resulting  from  prepayments  are  recognized  over  the  remaining  life of the
investment. The Company recognizes impairment on its CMBS whenever it determines
that the impact of  expected  future  credit  losses,  as  currently  projected,
exceeds the impact of the expected future credit losses as originally projected.
Impairment  losses are  determined by comparing the current fair value of a CMBS
to its existing  carrying  amount,  the difference being recognized as a loss in
the current period in the consolidated statements of operations of the period in
which the loss is identified.  Reduced estimates of credit losses are recognized
as an adjustment to yield over the remaining life of the portfolio.

Certificated Mezzanine Investments

Certificated  mezzanine  investments  available-for-sale  are  reported  on  the
consolidated  balance  sheets at fair  value  with any  corresponding  temporary
change in value  resulting  in an  unrealized  gain (loss)  being  reported as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive  income/(loss) in the stockholders'
equity section of the balance sheet, net of related income taxes. See Note 6.

Equity  investment  in CT  Mezzanine  Partners I LLC ("Fund  I"),  CT  Mezzanine
Partners II LP ("Fund II") and CT MP II LLC ("Fund II GP") (together "Funds")

As the Funds are not majority  owned or controlled  by the Company,  the Company
does not consolidate the Funds in its  consolidated  financial  statements.  The
Company  accounts  for  its  interest  in the  Funds  on the  equity  method  of
accounting.  As such, the Company reports a percentage the earnings of the Funds
equal to its  ownership  percentage  on a single  line item in the  consolidated
statement of operations as income from equity investments in the Funds.

3.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

Derivative Financial Instruments

In the normal  course of  business,  the  Company  uses a variety of  derivative
financial  instruments  to manage,  or hedge,  interest  rate risk.  The Company
requires  derivative  financial  instruments  to be  effective  in reducing  its
interest rate risk exposure.  This effectiveness is essential for qualifying for
hedge accounting.  When the terms of an underlying  transaction are modified, or
when the underlying  hedged item ceases to exist,  all changes in the fair value
of the  instrument  are  marked-to-market  with changes in value included in net
income each period until the derivative  instrument  matures or is settled.  Any
derivative  instrument  used for risk  management that does not meet the hedging
criteria is marked-to-market each period.

The Company uses interest rate swaps to effectively  convert  variable rate debt
to  fixed  rate  debt  for the  financed  portion  of  fixed  rate  assets.  The
differential  to be paid or received on these  agreements  is  recognized  as an
adjustment  to the interest  expense  related to debt and is  recognized  on the
accrual basis.

The Company also uses interest rate caps to reduce its exposure to interest rate
changes on  investments.  The Company will receive  payments on an interest rate
cap should the variable rate for which the cap was purchased  exceed a specified
threshold  level and will be recorded as an  adjustment  to the interest  income
related to the related earning asset.

To  determine  the fair values of  derivative  instruments,  the Company  uses a
variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks
existing at each balance sheet date.  For the majority of financial  instruments
including most derivatives,  long-term  investments and long-term debt, standard
market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis,  option
pricing models,  replacement  cost, and  termination  cost are used to determine
fair  value.   All  methods  of  assessing   fair  value  result  in  a  general
approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.

The swap and cap  agreements are generally held to maturity and the Company does
not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Equipment and Leasehold Improvements, Net

Equipment  and  leasehold  improvements,  net, are stated at original  cost less
accumulated  depreciation and  amortization.  Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line  method based on the estimated  lives of the  depreciable  assets.
Amortization is computed over the remaining terms of the related leases.

Expenditures  for maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense at the
time incurred.  Expenditures  determined to represent  additions and betterments
are  capitalized.  Cost of assets  sold or retired  and the  related  amounts of
accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts in the year of sale or
retirement.  Any  resulting  profit  or loss is  reflected  in the  consolidated
statement of operations.

Sales of Real Estate

The Company  complies with the  provisions of the FASB's  Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 66, "Accounting for Sales of Real Estate." Accordingly,
the recognition of gains is deferred until such  transactions have complied with
the criteria for full profit  recognition  under the statement.  The Company had
deferred  gains of $239,000 at December 31, 1999,  which were written off during
the year ended  December  31, 2000 when the related  loan was  determined  to be
uncollectible.

Deferred Debt Issuance Costs

The Company  capitalizes  costs  incurred  related to the  issuance of long-term
debt.  These costs are deferred and amortized on a straight-line  basis over the
life of the  related  debt,  which  approximates  the  level-yield  method,  and
recognized as a component of interest expense.

Income Taxes

The Company records its income taxes in accordance with the FASB's  Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS No.
109").  Under SFAS No. 109,  deferred  income taxes are  recognized  for the tax
consequences  of  "temporary  differences"  by applying  statutory tax rates for
future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and
the tax bases of  existing  assets  and  liabilities.  Deferred  tax  assets are
recognized for temporary  differences that will result in deductible  amounts in
future years and for carryforwards that are useable in future years. A valuation
allowance is  recognized  if it is more likely than not that some portion of the
deferred  asset will not be  recognized.  When  evaluating  whether a  valuation
allowance  is  appropriate,  SFAS No. 109  requires a company to  consider  such
factors as previous  operating results,  future earning potential,  tax planning
strategies and future reversals of existing temporary differences. The valuation
allowance  is  increased  or decreased in future years based on changes in these
criteria.

Pursuant to its venture  agreement with Citigroup,  the Company was obligated to
take the steps  necessary for it to be taxed as a Real Estate  Investment  Trust
("REIT") for the 2002 tax year.  Based on the  composition of its assets and the
nature of its income due in significant part to the successful implementation of
the  Company's  investment  management  business,  the Company does not meet the
qualifications  to elect to be  taxed  as a REIT at this  time.  In light of its
success with its investment  management  business,  the Company does not believe
that it is  advisable  at this time to pursue the  changes to its  business  and
assets  that would be  necessary  for it to qualify  for  taxation as a REIT and
therefore requested Citigroup waive the obligation, which request was granted by
Citigroup.  The  Company  continues  to pursue  alternative  strategies  for tax
efficiency.

Amortization of the Excess of Purchase Price Over Net Tangible Assets Acquired

The Company  recognized  the excess of purchase  price over net tangible  assets
acquired in a business  combination  accounted for as a purchase transaction and
is  amortizing  it on a  straight-line  basis  over a period  of 15  years.  The
carrying value of the excess of purchase price over net tangible assets acquired
was  analyzed  quarterly  by the  Company  based upon the  expected  revenue and
profitability  levels of the acquired  enterprise to determine whether the value
and future  benefit may indicate a decline in value.  If the Company  determined
that  there had been a  decline  in the value of the  acquired  enterprise,  the
Company  would have written down the value of the excess of purchase  price over
net tangible assets acquired to the revised fair value.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial  statements and the reported  amounts of revenues and expenses  during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Comprehensive Income

Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted the FASB's Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income" ("SFAS No. 130").
The statement  changes the reporting of certain items currently  reported in the
stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet and establishes  standards for
reporting  of  comprehensive  income  and  its  components  in  a  full  set  of
general-purpose  financial  statements.  Total  comprehensive  income/(loss) was
($9,813,000),  $9,773,000 and $11,577,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. The primary component of comprehensive income other
than  net  income  was  the  unrealized  gain  (loss)  on  derivative  financial
instruments and available-for-sale securities, net of related income taxes.

3.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

Earnings per Share of Common Stock

Earnings per share of Common Stock are presented  based on the  requirements  of
the FASB's Statement of Accounting Standards No. 128 ("SFAS No. 128"). Basic EPS
is computed based on the income  applicable to Common Stock (which is net income
or loss reduced by the dividends on the Preferred Stock) divided by the weighted
average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted
EPS is based on the net earnings  applicable  to Common Stock plus, if dilutive,
dividends  on the  Preferred  Stock  and  interest  paid  on  Convertible  Trust
Preferred Securities, net of tax benefit, divided by the weighted average number
of shares of Common Stock and  potentially  dilutive shares of Common Stock that
were outstanding during the period. At December 31, 2001,  potentially  dilutive
shares of Common Stock include the convertible  Preferred Stock, dilutive Common
Stock  warrants and options and future  commitments  for stock unit  awards.  At
December  31, 2000,  potentially  dilutive  shares of Common  Stock  include the
convertible  Preferred Stock,  Convertible Trust Preferred Securities and future
commitments for stock unit awards.  At December 31, 1999,  potentially  dilutive
shares of Common  Stock  include the  convertible  Preferred  Stock and dilutive
Common Stock options.

Reclassifications

Certain  reclassifications  have been made in the  presentation  of the 2000 and
1999 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2001 presentation.

Segment Reporting

As the Company manages its operations as one segment, separate segment reporting
is not presented for 2001, 2000 and 1999, as the financial information for that
segment is the same as the information in the consolidated financial statements.

4.  Available-for-Sale Securities

At December 31, 2001, the Company's  available-for-sale  securities consisted of

The Company  purchased  these  securities  on September 28, 2001 at a premium to

4.  Available-for-Sale Securities, continued

At December 31, 2000, the Company held no available-for sale securities.

During the year ended  December  31,  1999,  the  Company  sold its then  entire
portfolio  of  available-for  sale  securities  at a gain of $35,000  over their
amortized  cost. The cost of securities  sold was determined  using the specific
identification method.

5.  Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities

The  Company  pursues  rated  and  unrated  investments  in public  and  private
subordinated interests ("Subordinated Interests") in CMBS.

Because of a decision to sell a  held-to-maturity  security in 1998, the Company
transferred all of its investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities from
held-to-maturity  securities to available-for-sale and continues to classify the
CMBS as such.

During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company purchased  $36,509,000 face
amount of  interests  in three  subordinated  CMBS issued by a  financial  asset
securitization  investment  trust for  $36,335,000.  In April 2000,  the Company
received $1.4 million of additional  discount from the issuer of the  securities
in settlement of a dispute with the issuer. At December 31, 2001, the securities
had an amortized cost of $35,923,000  and a market value of  $35,539,000.  These
securities  bear  interest at floating  rates,  for which the  weighted  average
interest  rate in effect,  after fair value  adjustment at December 31, 2001, is
8.52%,  and mature in January  2003.  At  December  31,  2001,  the  Company has
deferred  acquisition  costs on  these  securities  of  $17,000  that are  being
amortized as a reduction of interest  income on a basis to realize a level yield
over the life of the investment.

On March 3, 1999,  the  Company,  through  its then newly  formed  wholly  owned
subsidiary,  CT-BB Funding Corp.,  acquired a portfolio of fixed-rate "BB" rated
CMBS (the "BB CMBS  Portfolio") from an affiliate of an existing credit facility
lender.  The  portfolio,  which  is  comprised  of 11  separate  issues  with an
aggregate face amount of $246.0 million,  was purchased for $196.9  million.  In
connection with the transaction,  an affiliate of the seller provided three-year
term financing for 70% of the purchase price at a floating rate above the London
Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and entered into an interest rate swap with the
Company  for the  full  duration  of the BB CMBS  Portfolio  securities  thereby
providing a hedge for interest  rate risk.  The financing was provided at a rate
that was below the current  market for  similar  financings  and,  as such,  the
carrying  amount of the  assets and the debt were  reduced  by $10.9  million to
adjust  the yield on the debt to current  market  terms.  The BB CMBS  Portfolio
securities  bear interest at fixed rates that have an average face rate of 7.74%
on the face amount and mature at various  dates from March 2005 to January 2013.
After giving effect to the discounted  purchase price, the fair value adjustment
and the  adjustment  of the  carrying  amount of the assets to bring the debt to
current market terms,  the weighted  average  interest rate in effect for the BB
CMBS Portfolio at December 31, 2001 was 12.57%.

6.  Certificated Mezzanine Investment

The Company purchased a high-yielding  mezzanine  investment that is subordinate
to senior  secured  loans on a commercial  real estate  asset.  This  investment
represent  interests in debt  service  from loans or property  cash flow and was
issued in certificate form. This certificated  investment carried  substantially
similar terms and risks as the Company's Mezzanine Loans.

The  certificated  mezzanine  investment  is a floating  rate  security  that is
carried at market value of $22,379,000 on December 31, 2000. As the market value
and amortized  cost were the same on December 31, 2000,  no  unrealized  gain or
loss was recorded. The certificated mezzanine investment outstanding at December
31, 2000 was satisfied in June 2001.

7.  Loans Receivable

The Company  currently pursues lending  opportunities  designed to capitalize on
inefficiencies  in the real estate capital,  mortgage and finance  markets.  The
Company  has  classified  its  loans  receivable  into  the  following   general
categories:

   o  Mortgage  Loans.  The  Company  originates  and funds  senior  and  junior
      mortgage  loans  ("Mortgage  Loans") to commercial  real estate owners and
      property   developers  who  require  interim   financing  until  permanent
      financing can be obtained.  The Company's Mortgage Loans are generally not
      intended to be  permanent  in nature,  but rather are  intended to be of a
      relatively   short-term   duration,   with  extension  options  as  deemed
      appropriate,  and  typically  require a balloon  payment of  principal  at
      maturity. The Company may also originate and fund permanent Mortgage Loans
      in which the Company intends to sell the senior tranche,  thereby creating
      a Mezzanine Loan (as defined below).

   o  Mezzanine  Loans.  The  Company  originates  high-yielding  loans that are
      subordinate to first lien mortgage loans on commercial real estate and are
      secured  either by a second  lien  mortgage  or a pledge of the  ownership
      interests in the borrowing property owner ("Mezzanine Loans").  Generally,
      the Company's Mezzanine Loans have a longer anticipated  duration than its
      Mortgage  Loans,  are not  intended  to  serve  as  transitional  mortgage
      financing  and can  represent  subordinated  investments  in  real  estate
      operating  companies which may take the form of secured or unsecured debt,
      preferred stock and other hybrid instruments.

   o  Other Loans  Receivable.  This  classification  includes loans  originated
      during  the  Company's  prior  operations  as a REIT and  other  loans and
      investments not meeting the above criteria.

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company's loans  receivable  consisted of the
following (in thousands):

</TABLE>

One Mortgage Loan  receivable  with a principal  balance of  $8,000,000  reached
maturity on July 15, 2000 and has not been repaid with respect to principal  and
interest.  In  accordance  with the  Company's  policy for revenue  recognition,
income  recognition  has been  suspended  on this loan and for the  years  ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000, $1,144,000 and $791,000,  respectively, of potential
interest income has not been recorded.

During the year ended December 31, 2000, one other loan  receivable,  originated
by the former  management of the Company's  predecessor REIT operations,  with a
net investment of $136,000,  was past-due more than 90 days and was written-off.
The net investment prior to the write-off  included the loan balance of $915,000
offset by $779,000 of non-recourse  financing of the asset. After the write-off,
both the loan receivable and the non-recourse  financing are carried at $779,000
until the non-recourse note payable was foreclosed upon on January 17, 2001 (see
note 11). The loan was  originated  during the Company's  prior  operations as a
REIT to  facilitate  the  disposal of a  previously  foreclosed-upon  asset.  In
accordance with the Company's policy for revenue recognition, income recognition
was suspended on this loan and for the year ended December 31, 2000,  $76,000 of
potential interest income has not been recorded.

At December 31, 2000, one Mezzanine Loan with a principal balance of $13,018,000
was in default as the loan  matured on December 1, 2000.  At December  31, 2000,
the loan was  earning a variable  interest  rate of LIBOR + 9.00%.  The loan was
repaid in full with interest on March 21, 2001.

During the year ended  December 31, 2001,  the Company  provided  $13,319,000 of
additional  fundings  on three  loans  originated  in prior  periods  and has no
outstanding commitments at December 31, 2001.

At December 31, 2001, the weighted  average  interest rate in effect,  including
amortization of fees and premiums, for the Company's performing loans receivable

In addition,  one of the loans for $49,625,000 has borrower extension rights for
an additional year.

At  December  31,  2001,  there are two loans to a  related  group of  borrowers
totaling $74.5 million or approximately 11% of total assets.  There are no other

9.  Excess of Purchase Price Over Net Tangible Assets Acquired

On July 15, 1997,  the Company  consummated  the  acquisition of the real estate
investment banking,  advisory and asset management  businesses of Victor Capital
and certain  affiliated  entities.  The acquisition had been accounted for under
the  purchase  method of  accounting.  The excess of the  purchase  price of the
acquisition in excess of net tangible assets acquired approximated $342,000.

The Company  recognized  the excess of purchase  price over net tangible  assets
acquired in a business  combination  accounted for as a purchase transaction and
had been amortizing it on a straight-line  basis over a period of 15 years.  The
carrying value of the excess of purchase price over net tangible assets acquired
was  analyzed  quarterly  by the  Company  based upon the  expected  revenue and
profitability  levels of the acquired  enterprise to determine whether the value
and future benefit may indicate a decline in value.

In April 2000, the Company  increased its level of resources  devoted to its new
investment  management  business and reduced resources devoted to its investment
banking and advisory operations.  As a result, the Company determined that there
has been a decline in the value of the acquired enterprise and the Company wrote
off the remaining value of the excess of purchase price over net tangible assets
acquired.   This  additional  $275,000  write-off  was  recorded  as  additional
amortization expense in the year ended December 31, 2000.

11.  Notes Payable

At  December  31,  2001 and 2000,  the  Company  has notes  payable  aggregating
$977,000 and $2,647,000, respectively.

In connection  with the  acquisition of Victor Capital and affiliated  entities,
the  Company  issued  $5.0  million  of  non-interest  bearing  unsecured  notes
("Acquisition  Notes") to the sellers, both of whom are directors of the Company
and one who serves as the current chief  executive  officer of the Company.  The
notes are payable in ten semi-annual payments of $500,000. The Acquisition Notes
were originally  discounted to $3,908,000  based on an imputed  interest rate of
9.5%.

At December 31,  2001,  the  Acquisition  Notes have two  remaining  semi-annual
payments maturing July 1, 2002. The net present value of the remaining  payments
on the Acquisition Notes at December 31, 2001 and 2000, amounted to $977,000 and
$1,868,000, respectively.

The Company was also indebted  under a  non-recourse  note payable due to a life
insurance  company  at  December  31,  2000.  This  note was  secured  by a loan
receivable for a property that was sold in 1997. The note bore interest at 9.50%
per annum with principal and interest payable monthly until August 7, 2017, when
the entire unpaid  principal  balance and any unpaid  interest was due. The life
insurance  company has the right to call the entire  note due and  payable  upon
ninety days prior written notice.  At December 31, 2000, the balance of the note
payable amounted to $779,000.  The Company's  borrower  defaulted on its payment
obligation under the loan receivable  securing the note payable in June 2000. As
the note payable is  non-recourse,  the Company  terminated  its payments to the
life  insurance  company and was in default on the note  payable at December 31,
2000.  The Company  determined  not to pursue  foreclosure on the defaulted loan
receivable and allowed the loan  receivable to be foreclosed upon on January 17,
2001, whereupon the non-recourse debt was extinguished.

Credit Facilities

Effective September 30, 1997, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a
commercial  lender that provided for a three-year  $150 million line of credit .
Effective January 1, 1998, pursuant to an amended and restated credit agreement,
the Company  increased the available  credit under this facility to $250 million
and  subsequently  further amended the credit agreement to increase the facility
to $300  million  effective  June 22, 1998 and $355 million  effective  July 23,
1998.  The Company  incurred an initial  commitment  fee upon the signing of the
credit agreement and the credit  agreement calls for additional  commitment fees
when the total  borrowing under the credit  facility  exceeds $75 million,  $150
million, $250 million and $300 million. Effective February 26, 1999, pursuant to
an amended and restated credit agreement, the Company extended the expiration of
such credit  facility  from  December  2001 to February  2002 with an  automatic
one-year amortizing extension option, if not otherwise extended.

On June 8, 1998, the Company entered into a second credit agreement with another
commercial  lender  that  provides  for a $300  million  line of credit  with an
original  expiration  date in December  1999 . The  Company  incurred an initial
commitment  fee upon the signing of this credit  facility.  Effective  March 30,
1999, pursuant to an amended and restated credit agreement, the Company extended
the  expiration of such credit  facility from December 1999 to June 2000 with an
automatic  nine-month  amortizing  extension option, if not otherwise  extended.
Effective June 30, 2000,  pursuant to an amended and restated credit  agreement,
the Company  extended the  expiration of such credit  facility from June 2000 to
June 2001 with an  automatic  nine-month  amortizing  extension  option,  if not
otherwise extended. Effective July 16, 2001, pursuant to an amended and restated
credit  agreement,  the Company  reduced the amount of credit  under this credit
facility to $100  million and extended the  expiration  of such credit  facility
from  September  2001  to July  2002  with an  automatic  nine-month  amortizing
extension option, if not otherwise extended.

The credit  facilities  provide for advances to fund  lender-approved  loans and
investments made by the Company ("Funded Portfolio Assets").  The obligations of
the  Company  under the credit  facilities  are secured by pledges of the Funded
Portfolio Assets acquired with advances under the credit facilities.  Borrowings
under the credit  facilities bear interest at specified rates over LIBOR,  which
rates may  fluctuate,  based  upon the credit  quality  of the Funded  Portfolio
Assets.  Future repayments and redrawdowns of amounts  previously subject to the
drawdown fee will not require the Company to pay any additional fees. The credit
facilities provide for margin calls on asset-specific borrowings in the event of
asset quality and/or market value  deterioration  as determined under the credit
facilities.   The  credit  facilities  contain  customary   representations  and
warranties,   covenants  and  conditions  and  events  of  default.  The  credit
facilities also contain a covenant obligating the Company to avoid undergoing an
ownership change that results in Craig M. Hatkoff,  John R. Klopp or Samuel Zell
no longer retaining their senior offices and directorships  with the Company and
practical control of the Company's business and operations. The providers of the
credit  facilities  have notified the Company that the  resignation  of Craig M.
Hatkoff  on  December  29,  2000 is not an  event  of  non-compliance  with  the
foregoing covenant.

At December 31,  2001,  the Company has  borrowed  $29,076,000  against the $355
million credit facility at an average borrowing rate (including  amortization of
fees  incurred  and  capitalized)  of 6.13%.  The Company has pledged  assets of
$87,879,000 as collateral for the borrowing against such credit facility.

At December 31,  2001,  the Company has  borrowed  $92,135,000  against the $100
million credit facility at an average borrowing rate (including  amortization of
fees  incurred  and  capitalized)  of 4.88%.  The Company has pledged  assets of
$201,442,000 as collateral for the borrowing against such credit facility.

On December 31,  2001,  the unused  amount of potential  credit under the credit
facilities was $319,765,000.

Repurchase Obligations

During  2001,  the Company had entered  into three  repurchase  agreements.  Two
repurchase agreements were satisfied during the year ended December 31, 2001 and
the other was outstanding at December 31, 2001.

The first repurchase  agreement,  with a securities dealer,  arose in connection
with the purchase of a Certificated Mezzanine Investment.  At December 31, 2000,
the  Company  has  sold  such  asset  with a book  value of  $22,379,000,  which
approximates  market  value,  and has a liability to  repurchase  this asset for
$16,569,000.  This repurchase agreement was extended to May 2001 during the year
ended December 31, 2000 and satisfied in June 2001 with the proceeds of the loan
repayment. The liability balance bore interest at a specified rate over LIBOR.

The second repurchase  agreement,  with a securities dealer, arose in connection
with  the  purchase  of  a  available-for-sale  securities  in  June  2001.  The
repurchase agreement was settled in July 2001 when the securities were sold.

The third repurchase  agreement,  with Morgan Stanley,  arose in connection with
the purchase of a  available-for-sale  securities in September 2001. At December
31,  2001,  the  Company  has sold such asset  with a book and  market  value of
$152,789,000 and has a liability to repurchase this asset for $147,880,000. This
repurchase  agreement has a maturity date in March 2002.  The liability  balance
bears interest at LIBOR.

The  interest  rate in  effect  for the  repurchase  obligation  outstanding  at
December 31, 2001 was 2.03% and the interest  rate in effect for the  repurchase
obligation outstanding at December 31, 2000 was 8.32%.

Term Redeemable Securities Contract

In connection with the purchase of the BB CMBS Portfolio described in Note 5, an
affiliate of the seller  provided  financing for 70% of the purchase  price,  or
$137.8  million,  at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 50 basis points pursuant to a
term  redeemable  securities  contract.  This rate was below the market rate for
similar financings,  and, as such, a discount on the term redeemable  securities
contract was recorded to reduce the carrying  amount by $10.9 million (which has
been  amortized to  $679,000),  which had the effect of  adjusting  the yield to
current  market terms.  The debt has a three-year  term that expires in February
2002.

By entering into interest rate swaps, the Company has effectively  converted the
term  redeemable  securities  contract to a fixed interest rate of 6.55%.  After
adjusting  the  carrying  amount and yield to  current  market  terms,  the term
redeemable securities contract bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 9.54%.

13.  Derivative Financial Instruments

On January 1, 2001,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities,"  as amended by SFAS No. 138,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Derivative
Instruments  and  Certain  Hedging   Activities."  SFAS  No.  133,  as  amended,
establishes  accounting  and  reporting  standards for  derivative  instruments.
Specifically  SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize  all  derivatives  as
either assets or liabilities in the  consolidated  balance sheets and to measure
those instruments at fair value.  Additionally,  the fair value adjustments will
affect  either  shareholders'  equity or net income  depending  on  whether  the
derivative  instrument  qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so,
the nature of the hedging  activity.  As of January 1, 2001, the adoption of the
new  standard  resulted  in an  adjustment  of  $574,000  to  accumulated  other
comprehensive loss and other liabilities.

13.  Derivative Financial Instruments, continued

In the  normal  course of  business,  the  Company  is  exposed to the effect of
interest rate changes.  The Company limits these risks by following  established
risk  management  policies  and  procedures  including  those  for  the  use  of
derivatives.  For interest rate  exposures,  derivatives  are used  primarily to
align rate movements  between interest rates associated with the Company's loans
and other financial  assets with interest rates on related debt  financing,  and
manage the cost of borrowing obligations.

The  Company  does not use  derivatives  for  trading or  speculative  purposes.
Further,  the Company has a policy of only  entering into  contracts  with major
financial  institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors.  When
viewed in  conjunction  with the  underlying  and  offsetting  exposure that the
derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss
from those  instruments,  nor does it anticipate any material  adverse effect on
its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.

To manage interest rate risk, the Company may employ options, forwards, interest
rate swaps, caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying
exposure.  To reduce  overall  interest  cost,  the Company uses  interest  rate
instruments, typically interest rate swaps, to convert a portion of its variable
rate debt to fixed rate debt. Interest rate differentials that arise under these
swap  contracts  are  recognized  as  interest  expense  over  the  life  of the
contracts.

The  following  table  summarizes  the  notional  value  and  fair  value of the
Company's  derivative  financial  instruments,  principally  swap  contracts  at
December 31, 2001.  The notional  value  provides an indication of the extent of
the  Company's  involvement  in these  instruments  at that  time,  but does not
represent exposure to credit, interest rate or foreign exchange market risks.

Financial reporting for hedges  characterized as fair value hedges and cash flow
hedges are different.  For those hedges characterized as a fair value hedge, the
changes in fair value of the hedge and the hedged item are reflected in earnings
each quarter.  In the case of the fair value hedge listed above,  the Company is
hedging the component of interest  rate risk that can be directly  controlled by
the  hedging  instrument,  and it is this  portion of the hedged  assets that is
recognized   in  earnings.   The   non-hedged   balance  is   classified  as  an
available-for-sale  security  consistent  with SFAS No. 115,  and is reported in
accumulated other comprehensive  income. For those hedges  characterized as cash
flow hedges,  the unrealized  gains/losses in the fair value of these hedges are
reported  on  the  balance  sheet  with a  corresponding  adjustment  to  either
accumulated other comprehensive income or in earnings,  depending on the type of
hedging relationship.

On December 31, 2001,  the  derivative  financial  instruments  were reported at
their fair value as other assets and interest rate hedge  liabilities of $82,000
and $9,987,000, respectively.

During the year ended  December  31,  2001,  the  Company  recognized  a gain of
$47,000 for the change in time value for  qualifying  interest rate hedges.  The
time value is a component of fair value that must be recognized in earnings, and
is shown in the  consolidated  statement of  operations  as  unrealized  loss on
derivative securities.

13.  Derivative Financial Instruments, continued

The fair value hedge in the above table was undertaken by the Company to sustain
the  value  of its  CMBS  holdings.  This  fair  value  hedge,  when  viewed  in
conjunction  with the fair value of the  securities,  is sustaining the value of
those securities as interest rates rise and fall. During the twelve months ended
December 31, 2001, the Company  recognized a loss of $5,479,000 for the decrease
in the value of the swap which was substantially  offset by a gain of $4,890,000
for the change in the fair value of the securities attributed to the hedged risk
resulting in a $589,000  charge to unrealized  loss on derivative  securities on
the consolidated statement of operations.

The Company  utilizes cash flow hedges in order to better control interest costs
on variable rate debt  transactions.  Interest rate swaps that convert  variable
payments to fixed payments,  interest rate caps, floors,  collars,  and forwards
are  considered  cash flow hedges.  During the year ended December 31, 2001, the
fair value of the cash flow swaps decreased by $2.9 million,  which was deferred
into  other  comprehensive  loss  and  will be  released  to  earnings  over the
remaining lives of the swaps.

Over  time,  the  unrealized   gains  and  losses  held  in  accumulated   other
comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings.  This reclassification is
consistent  with the  timing of when the  hedged  items are also  recognized  in
earnings. Within the next twelve months, the Company estimates that $2.5 million
currently held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to
earnings, with regard to the cash flow hedges.

14.  Convertible Trust Preferred Securities

On July 28, 1998, the Company  privately placed  originally issued 150,000 8.25%
step up convertible trust preferred  securities  (liquidation  amount $1,000 per
security) with an aggregate liquidation amount of $150 million.

The  convertible  trust  preferred  securities  were  originally  issued  by the
Company's consolidated  statutory trust subsidiary,  CT Convertible Trust I (the
"Trust") and represented an undivided  beneficial  interest in the assets of the
Trust that consisted  solely of the Company's  8.25% step up convertible  junior
subordinated  debentures in the aggregate  principal amount of $154,650,000 that
were concurrently sold and originally issued to the Trust.  Distributions on the
convertible trust preferred securities were payable quarterly in arrears on each
calendar  quarter-end  and  correspond  to the payments of interest  made on the
convertible debentures, the sole assets of the Trust. Distributions were payable
only to the extent payments were made in respect to the convertible debentures.

The Company received $145,207,000 in net proceeds, after original issue discount
of 3% from the liquidation amount of the convertible trust preferred  securities
and transaction expenses, pursuant to the above transactions, which were used to
pay down the  Company's  credit  facilities.  The  convertible  trust  preferred
securities  were  convertible  into shares of Class A Common Stock at an initial
rate of 85.47 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000  principal amount of the
convertible  debentures  held by the Trust (which is  equivalent to a conversion
price of $11.70 per share of Class A Common Stock).

On May 10, 2000,  the Company  modified the terms of the $150 million  aggregate
liquidation amount convertible trust preferred securities.

14.  Convertible Trust Preferred Securities, continued

In connection with the  modification,  the then  outstanding  convertible  trust
preferred  securities  were canceled and new variable step up convertible  trust
preferred  securities with an aggregate  liquidation amount of $150,000,000 were
issued to the holders of the canceled securities in exchange therefore,  and the
original underlying  convertible  debentures were canceled and new 8.25% step up
convertible junior subordinated  debentures in the aggregate principal amount of
$92,524,000 and new 13% step up non-convertible  junior subordinated  debentures
in the aggregate  principal  amount of $62,126,000  were issued to the Trust, as
the holder of the canceled bonds, in exchange therefore.  The liquidation amount
of the new convertible trust preferred securities is divided into $89,742,000 of
convertible amount (the "Convertible Amount") and $60,258,000 of non-convertible
amount (the  "Non-Convertible  Amount"),  the  distribution,  redemption and, as
applicable,  conversion terms of which, mirror the interest,  redemption and, as
applicable,  conversion  terms  of the new  convertible  debentures  and the new
non-convertible debentures, respectively, held by the Trust.

Distributions  on the new  convertible  trust  preferred  securities are payable
quarterly in arrears on each calendar quarter-end and correspond to the payments
of  interest  made  on the  new  debentures,  the  sole  assets  of  the  Trust.
Distributions are payable only to the extent payments are made in respect to the
new debentures.

The new convertible trust preferred  securities  initially bear a blended coupon
rate of 10.16% per annum which rate will vary as the  proportion of  outstanding
Convertible  Amount to the outstanding  Non-Convertible  Amount changes and will
step up in  accordance  with the  coupon  rate step up terms  applicable  to the
Convertible Amount and the Non-Convertible Amount.

The Convertible  Amount bears a coupon rate of 8.25% per annum through March 31,
2002 and  increases  on April 1, 2002 to the  greater  of (i)  10.00% per annum,
increasing  by 0.75% on October 1, 2004 and on each October 1 thereafter or (ii)
a percentage  per annum equal to the  quarterly  dividend paid on a common share
multiplied by four and divided by $7.00.  The Convertible  Amount is convertible
into shares of Class A Common  Stock,  in  increments  of $1,000 in  liquidation
amount,  at a conversion  price of $7.00 per share.  The  Convertible  Amount is
redeemable by the Company, in whole or in part, on or after September 30, 2004.

The  Non-Convertible  Amount  bears a coupon  rate of 13.00%  per annum  through
September 30, 2004, increasing by 0.75% on October 1, 2004 and on each October 1
thereafter. The Non-Convertible Amount is redeemable by the Company, in whole or
in part, at any time.

For financial  reporting  purposes,  the Trust is treated as a subsidiary of the
Company  and,  accordingly,  the  accounts  of the  Trust  are  included  in the
consolidated  financial  statements  of the Company.  Intercompany  transactions
between the Trust and the Company,  including the original  convertible  and new
debentures, have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of the
Company.  The  original  convertible  trust  preferred  securities  and  the new
convertible  trust  preferred  securities  are  presented as a separate  caption
between  liabilities  and  stockholders'  equity  ("Convertible  Trust Preferred
Securities") in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company.  Distributions on
the original  convertible  trust  preferred  securities and the new  convertible
trust preferred  securities are recorded,  net of the tax benefit, in a separate
caption immediately following the provision for income taxes in the consolidated
statements of operations of the Company.

15.  Stockholders' Equity

Authorized Capital

Upon consummation of the  reorganization  (see Note 1), each outstanding Class A
Common Share of the  predecessor  was converted into one share of Class A Common
Stock  of the  Company,  and each  outstanding  Class A  Preferred  Share of the
predecessor  was  converted  into one  share of Class A  Preferred  Stock of the
Company. As a result, all of the predecessor's  previously issued Class A Common
Shares have been  reclassified  as shares of Class A Common Stock and all of the
predecessor's  previously issued Class A Preferred Shares have been reclassified
as shares of Class A Preferred Stock.

The  Company  has the  authority  to issue up to  300,000,000  shares  of stock,
consisting of (i) 100,000,000  shares of Class A Common Stock,  (ii) 100,000,000
shares  of class B common  stock,  par value  $0.01  per share  ("Class B Common
Stock"), and (iii) 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The board of directors
is generally  authorized to issue additional  shares of authorized stock without
stockholders' approval.

Common Stock

Except as  described  herein or as required by law, all shares of Class A Common
Stock and shares of Class B Common Stock are  identical and entitled to the same
dividend,  distribution,  liquidation and other rights. The Class A Common Stock
are  voting  shares  entitled  to vote  on all  matters  presented  to a vote of
stockholders,  except as provided by law or subject to the voting  rights of any
outstanding  Preferred  Stock.  The  shares of Class B Common  Stock do not have
voting  rights and are not counted in  determining  the presence of a quorum for
the  transaction of business at any meeting of the  stockholders of the Company.
Holders of record of shares of Class A Common Stock and shares of Class B Common
Stock on the record date fixed by the Company's  board of directors are entitled
to receive such  dividends as may be declared by the board of directors  subject
to the rights of the holders of any outstanding preferred stock.

Each share of Class A Common  Stock is  convertible  at the option of the holder
thereof  into one  share  of  Class B  Common  Stock  and,  subject  to  certain
conditions;  each share of Class B Common Stock is  convertible at the option of
the holder thereof into one share of Class A Common Stock.

Preferred Stock

In  connection  with the  reorganization,  the  Company  created  two classes of
Preferred  Stock,  Class  A  Preferred  Stock  and the  class B 9.5%  cumulative
convertible non-voting preferred stock ("Class B Preferred Stock"). As described
above, upon consummation of the  reorganization,  the predecessor's  outstanding
Class A Preferred  Shares were  converted  into shares of the Company's  Class A
Preferred  Stock.  Following  the  reorganization,  certain  shares  of  Class A
Preferred  Stock  were  converted  into  shares of Class B  Preferred  Stock and
certain  shares of Class A Common  Stock were  converted  into shares of Class B
Common Stock.

15.  Stockholders' Equity, continued

Except as  described  herein or as required by law,  both  classes of  Preferred
Stock  were  identical  and  entitled  to  the  same   dividend,   distribution,
liquidation  and other rights.  The holders of the Class A Preferred  Stock were
entitled  to vote  together  with the  holders of the Class A Common  Stock as a
single class on all matters  submitted to a vote of stockholders.  Each share of
Class A Preferred  Stock  entitled  the holder  thereof to a number of votes per
share  equal to the  number of shares of Class A Common  Stock  into  which such
shares of Class A  Preferred  Stock was then  convertible.  Except as  described
herein,  the holders of Class B Preferred  Stock did not have voting  rights and
were not counted in determining  the presence of a quorum for the transaction of
business at a stockholders'  meeting.  The affirmative  vote of the holders of a
majority  of the  outstanding  Preferred  Stock,  voting  together as a separate
single  class,  except in certain  circumstances,  had the right to approve  any
merger,  consolidation or transfer of all or substantially  all of the assets of
the Company.  Holders of the Preferred Stock were entitled to receive,  when and
as declared by the board of directors,  cash  dividends per share at the rate of
9.5% per annum on a per share price of $2.69. Such dividends accrued (whether or
not  declared)  and,  to the  extent  not paid  for any  dividend  period,  were
cumulative.  Dividends on the authorized Preferred Stock were payable,  when and
as declared, semi-annually, in arrears, on December 26 and June 25 of each year.

Each  share of Class A  Preferred  Stock was  convertible  at the  option of the
holder  thereof  into an equal number of shares of Class B Preferred  Stock,  or
into a number of  shares  Class A Common  Stock  equal to the ratio of (x) $2.69
plus an amount equal to all dividends per share accrued and unpaid thereon as of
the date of such conversion to (y) the conversion price in effect as of the date
of such conversion. Each share of Class B Preferred Stock was convertible at the
option of the  holder  thereof,  subject to  certain  conditions,  into an equal
number of shares of Class A Preferred  Stock or into a number of shares of Class
B Common  Stock  equal to the  ratio of (x) $2.69  plus an  amount  equal to all
dividends per share accrued and unpaid thereon as of the date of such conversion
to (y) the conversion price in effect as of the date of such conversion.

In December 2001,  following the repurchase of all of the outstanding  shares of
Preferred  Stock (as  discussed  below),  the  Company  amended  its  charter to
eliminate from authorized  capital the previously  designated  Class A Preferred
Stock  and  Class B  Preferred  Stock  and  increase  the  authorized  shares of
preferred stock to 100,000,000.

As of December 31, 1998, there were 12,267,658 shares of Class A Preferred Stock
issued and  outstanding,  no shares of Class B  Preferred  Stock were issued and
outstanding,  18,158,816  shares  of  Class  A  Common  Stock  were  issued  and
outstanding  and no shares of Class B Common Stock were issued and  outstanding.
The  12,267,658  shares of Class A Preferred  Stock  outstanding at December 31,
1998 were  originally  issued and  purchased  by Veqtor on July 15,  1997 for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $33 million (see Note 1).

Until August 10, 1999 (the  "Conversion  Date"),  Veqtor owned  6,959,593 of the
outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and all 12,267,658 of the outstanding
shares of Class A Preferred Stock. Veqtor was then controlled by the chairman of
the board,  the vice  chairman  and chief  executive  officer  and the then vice
chairman  and chairman of the  executive  committee of the board of directors of
the Company in their capacities as the persons controlling the common members of
Veqtor. Prior to the Conversion Date, the common members owned approximately 48%
of the equity  ownership  of Veqtor and three  commercial  banks,  as  preferred
members of Veqtor, owned the remaining 52% of the equity ownership of Veqtor.

Common and Preferred Stock Outstanding

During March 2000, the Company commenced an open market share repurchase program
under which the Company was  authorized  to purchase,  from time to time,  up to
four  million  shares of Class A Common  Stock.  As of December  31,  2001,  the
Company had purchased and retired, pursuant to the program,  2,564,400 shares of
Class A  Common  Stock  at an  average  price  of  $4.14  per  share  (including
commissions).

The Company has no further obligations to issue additional warrants to Citigroup
at  December  31,  2001.  The  value  of the  warrants  at the  issuance  dates,
$4,636,000,  was capitalized and will be amortized over the anticipated lives of
the Mezzanine Funds.

In two  privately  negotiated  transactions  closed in April  2001,  the Company
repurchased for $29,138,000,  630,701 shares of Class A Common Stock,  1,520,831
shares of Class B Common Stock,  1,518,390 shares of Class A Preferred Stock and
2,274,110  shares  of Class B  Preferred  Stock.  In  addition,  in a  privately
negotiated  transaction closed in August 2001, the Company repurchased for $21.0
million,  200,000  shares of Class A Common Stock,  1,234,355  shares of Class B
Common Stock,  759,195 shares of Class A Preferred Stock and 1,769,138 shares of
Class B Preferred  Stock.  The Company has  repurchased  all of its  outstanding
Preferred Stock and eliminated the related dividend.

17.  Income Taxes, continued

The Company has federal net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") as of December
31, 2001 of approximately  $15.4 million.  Such NOLs expire through 2021. Due to
an  ownership  change in January  1997 and another  prior  ownership  change,  a
substantial  portion of the NOLs are limited for federal  income tax purposes to
approximately  $1.4  million  annually.   Any  unused  portion  of  such  annual
limitation can be carried forward to future periods.

eligible  employees to  contribute  up to 15% of their salary into the plan on a
pre-tax  basis,  subject to annual  limits.  The Company has  committed  to make
contributions  to the plan equal to 3% of all eligible  employees'  compensation
subject  to annual  limits  and may make  additional  contributions  based  upon
earnings.  The Company's  contribution  expense for the years ended December 31,

18.  Employee Benefit Plans, continued

1997 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan

The  Company's  1997 Amended and Restated  Long-Term  Incentive  Stock Plan (the
"Incentive Stock Plan") permits the grant of nonqualified stock option ("NQSO"),
incentive stock option  ("ISO"),  restricted  stock,  stock  appreciation  right
("SAR"), performance unit, performance stock and stock unit awards. A maximum of
1,353,753  shares of Class A Common  Stock may be issued  during the fiscal year
2002  pursuant to awards under the Incentive  Stock Plan and the Director  Stock
Plan (as defined below) in addition to the shares subject to awards  outstanding
under the two plans at December 31, 2001.  The maximum number of shares that may
be subject to awards to any employee  during the term of the plan may not exceed
500,000  shares and the  maximum  amount  payable in cash to any  employee  with
respect  to  any  performance   period  pursuant  to  any  performance  unit  or
performance stock award is $1.0 million.

The ISOs shall be  exercisable  no more than ten years after their date of grant
and five years after the grant in the case of a 10%  stockholder and vest over a
period of three years with one-third vesting at each anniversary  date.  Payment
of an option may be made with cash, with previously  owned Class A Common Stock,
by foregoing compensation in accordance with performance  compensation committee
or compensation committee rules or by a combination of these.

Restricted  stock may be granted under the Incentive Stock Plan with performance
goals and periods of restriction  as the board of directors may  designate.  The
performance  goals may be based on the  attainment of certain  objective  and/or
subjective measures.  In 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company issued 227,780 shares,
230,304 shares and 104,167 shares,  respectively,  of restricted  stock.  62,374
shares were  canceled in 2000 and 32,500  shares were  canceled in 1999 upon the
resignation of employees prior to vesting. The shares of restricted stock issued
in 2001  vest  one-third  on each of the  following  dates:  February  1,  2002,
February 1, 2003 and February 1, 2004. The shares of restricted  stock issued in
2000 vest one-third on each of the following dates:  February 1, 2001,  February
1, 2002 and February 1, 2003. The shares of restricted stock issued in 1999 vest
one-third on each of the following dates: February 2, 2000, February 2, 2001 and
February 2, 2002. The Company also granted  52,083 shares of  performance  based
restricted  stock in 1999 for which none of the performance  goals have been met
and the shares have not been issued.

The Incentive  Stock Plan also  authorizes  the grant of stock units at any time
and from  time to time on such  terms as shall  be  determined  by the  board of
directors or administering  compensation committee. Stock units shall be payable
in Class A Common Stock upon the occurrence of certain trigger events. The terms
and  conditions  of the  trigger  events  may vary by stock unit  award,  by the
participant, or both.

The following  table  summarizes the activity under the Incentive Stock Plan for
the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999:

performance  unit, stock and stock unit awards. A maximum of 1,353,753 shares of
Class A Common  Stock may be issued  during the  fiscal  year 2001  pursuant  to
awards under the Director  Stock Plan and the Incentive  Stock Plan, in addition
to the shares subject to awards  outstanding under the two plans at December 31,
2001.

The board of directors  shall  determine the purchase price per share of Class A
Common Stock covered by a NQSO granted under the Director Stock Plan. Payment of
a NQSO may be made with cash,  with  previously  owned  shares of Class A Common
Stock,  by  foregoing  compensation  in  accordance  with  board  rules  or by a
combination of these payment methods. SARs may be granted under the plan in lieu
of NQSOs, in addition to NQSOs,  independent of NQSOs or as a combination of the
foregoing.  A holder of a SAR is entitled  upon  exercise  to receive  shares of
Class A  Common  Stock,  or cash or a  combination  of  both,  as the  board  of
directors may determine, equal in value on the date of exercise to the amount by
which the fair market  value of one share of Class A Common Stock on the date of
exercise  exceeds  the  exercise  price  fixed by the board on the date of grant
(which price shall not be less than 100% of the market price of a share of Class
A Common  Stock on the date of  grant)  multiplied  by the  number  of shares in
respect to which the SARs are exercised.

Restricted  stock may be granted under the Director Stock Plan with  performance
goals and periods of restriction  as the board of directors may  designate.  The
performance  goals may be based on the  attainment of certain  objective  and/or
subjective measures.  The Director Stock Plan also authorizes the grant of stock
units at any time and from time to time on such terms as shall be  determined by
the board of directors. Stock units shall be payable in shares of Class A Common
Stock upon the occurrence of certain trigger events. The terms and conditions of
the trigger events may vary by stock unit award, by the participant, or both.

The following  table  summarizes  the activity under the Director Stock Plan for
the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999:

18.  Employee Benefit Plans, continued

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation" was issued by the FASB
in October 1996. SFAS No. 123 encourages the adoption of a new fair-value  based
accounting method for employee stock-based compensation plans. SFAS No. 123 also
permits companies to continue  accounting for stock-based  compensation plans as
prescribed  by APB  Opinion  No. 25.  However,  companies  electing  to continue
accounting  for  stock-based  compensation  plans under APB Opinion No. 25, must
make pro  forma  disclosures  as if the  company  adopted  the cost  recognition
requirements  under SFAS No.  123.  The  Company  has  continued  to account for
stock-based compensation under APB Opinion No. 25. Accordingly,  no compensation
cost has been recognized for the Incentive Stock Plan or the Director Stock Plan
in the accompanying  consolidated statements of operations as the exercise price
of the  stock  options  granted  thereunder  equaled  the  market  price  of the
underlying stock on the date of the grant.

Pro forma information regarding net income and net earnings per common share has
been estimated at the date of the grant using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing
model based on the following assumptions:

                                 2001              2000              1999
                            --------------    ---------------    --------------
Risk-free interest rate         4.75%             6.65%             5.2%
Volatility                     25.0%             40.0%             40.0%
Dividend yield                  0.0%              0.0%              0.0%
Expected life (years)           5.0               5.0               5.0

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded  options  that have no vesting  restrictions  and are fully
transferable.  In addition,  option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective  assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility.  Because
the  Company's  employee  stock  options  have   characteristics   significantly
different from those of traded  options,  and because  changes in the subjective
input  assumptions  can  materially  affect  the  fair  value  estimate,  in the
Company's  opinion,  the existing models do not  necessarily  provide a reliable
single  measure of the fair value of its employee  stock  options.  The weighted
average fair value of each stock option  granted during the years ended December
31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $1.47, $1.58 and $2.41, respectively.

For purposes of pro forma  disclosures,  the estimated fair value of the options
is amortized to expense over the options'  vesting  period.  The  Company's  pro
forma  information  for the years ended  December 31, 2001,  2000 and 1999 is as
follows  (in  thousands,  except  for net  earnings  (loss)  per share of common

19.  Fair Values of Financial Instruments

SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial  Instruments," requires
disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not
recognized in the statement of financial condition,  for which it is practicable
to estimate that value.  In cases where quoted market prices are not  available,
fair values are based upon  estimates  using  present  value or other  valuation
techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used,
including the discount rate and the estimated future cash flows. In that regard,
the derived  fair value  estimates  cannot be  substantiated  by  comparison  to
independent  markets  and,  in many cases,  could not be  realized in  immediate
settlement  of  the  instrument.   SFAS  No.  107  excludes  certain   financial
instruments and all non-financial  instruments from its disclosure requirements.
Accordingly,  the aggregate  fair value amounts do not represent the  underlying
value of the Company.

The following  methods and  assumptions  were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

   Cash and cash  equivalents:  The  carrying  amount  of cash on hand and money
   market funds is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.

   Available-for-sale  securities:  The fair value was determined based upon the
   market value of the securities.

   Commercial  mortgage-backed  securities:  The  fair  value  was  obtained  by
   obtaining quotes from a market maker in the security.

   Certificated mezzanine investments:  The fair value was obtained by obtaining
   a quote from a market maker in the security.

   Loans  receivable,  net:  The fair values  were  estimated  by using  current
   institutional  purchaser  yield  requirements  for loans with similar  credit
   characteristics.

   Interest  rate cap  agreement:  The fair value was  estimated  based upon the
   amount at which similar financial instruments would be valued.

   Credit  facilities:  The credit  facilities are at floating rates of interest
   for which the spread  over LIBOR is at rates that are similar to those in the
   market currently.  Therefore,  the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of
   fair value.

   Repurchase obligations: The repurchase obligations, which are generally short
   term in nature,  bear  interest  at a  floating  rate and the book value is a
   reasonable estimate of fair value.

   Term redeemable securities contract:  The fair value was estimated based upon
   the amount at which similar  privately placed financial  instruments would be
   valued.

   Convertible  Trust Preferred  Securities:  The fair value was estimated based
   upon the amount at which similar privately placed financial instruments would
   be valued.

   Interest rate swap agreements:  The fair values were estimated based upon the
   amount at which similar financial instruments would be valued.

23.  Segment Reporting

As the Company manages its operations as one segment, separate segment reporting
is not presented for 2001,  2000 and 1999 as the financial  information for that
segment is the same as the information in the consolidated financial statements.

24.  Risk Factors

The  Company's  assets are  subject to  various  risks that can affect  results,
including  the level and  volatility  of  prevailing  interest  rates and credit
spreads, adverse changes in general economic conditions and real estate markets,
the  deterioration  of credit quality of borrowers and the risks associated with
the ownership and operation of real estate.  Any significant  compression of the
spreads  of the  interest  rates  earned  on  interest-earning  assets  over the
interest  rates  paid on  interest-bearing  liabilities  could  have a  material
adverse effect on the Company's operating results as could adverse  developments
in the  availability  of desirable  loan and  investment  opportunities  and the
ability to obtain and maintain  targeted levels of leverage and borrowing costs.
Adverse changes in national and regional economic  conditions can have an effect
on real  estate  values  increasing  the risk of  undercollateralization  to the
extent that the fair market value of properties  serving as collateral  security
for the Company's assets are reduced.  Numerous factors, such as adverse changes
in local market  conditions,  competition,  increases in operating  expenses and
uninsured losses,  can affect a property owner's ability to maintain or increase
revenues to cover  operating  expenses  and the debt  service on the  property's
financing and, consequently, lead to a deterioration in credit quality or a loan
default and reduce the value of the Company's assets. In addition,  the yield to
maturity  on the  Company's  CMBS  assets are  subject to the  default  and loss
experience on the underlying  mortgage  loans, as well as by the rate and timing
of payments of principal.  If there are realized losses on the underlying loans,
the Company may not recover the full  amount,  or  possibly,  any of its initial
investment in the affected CMBS asset.  To the extent there are  prepayments  on
the underlying  mortgage  loans as a result of  refinancing at lower rates,  the
Company's  CMBS assets may be retired  substantially  earlier  than their stated
maturities  leading to  reinvestment in lower yielding  assets.  There can be no
assurance  that the Company's  assets will not  experience  any of the foregoing
risks or that, as a result of any such experience, the Company will not suffer a
reduced return on investment or an investment loss.

26.  Subsequent Events

On February 28, 2002,  Company's  $355 million credit  facility  matured and the
Term Redeemable Securities Contract became due and settled, upon which event the
Company  entered  into a new term  redeemable  securities  contract  and two new
repurchase obligations.

The new term redeemable  securities  contract was utilized to finance certain of
the assets that were  previously  financed with the maturing credit facility and
Term  Redeemable  Securities  Contract.   The  new  term  redeemable  securities
contract,  which allows for a maximum  financing of $75 million,  is recourse to
the Company.  The new term  redeemable  securities  contract has a two-year term
with  an  automatic  one-year  amortizing  extension  option,  if not  otherwise
extended.  The Company  incurred an initial  commitment fee of $750,000 upon the
signing of the new term  redeemable  securities  contract  and the Company  pays
interest at  specified  rates over  LIBOR.  The new term  redeemable  securities
contract  contains  customary  representations  and  warranties,  covenants  and
conditions and events of default.

An affiliate of the counterparty to the new term redeemable  securities contract
also holds an interest  rate swap with the Company for the full  duration of the
BB CMBS  Portfolio,  thereby  providing  a hedge for  interest  rate risk.  This
agreement  had a mutual  put option  for the value of the hedge  exercisable  in
February 2002.  This mutual put has been extended for an additional  three years
to February 2005. The notional values of the swap,  $137,812,000 at December 31,
2001,  increased  under the terms of the original swap agreement to $169,090,000
in February 2002.

One of the  new  repurchase  obligations,  with a  AAA-rated  counterparty,  was
utilized to finance  CMBS  securities  that were  previously  financed  with the
maturing credit facility and original Term Redeemable  Securities  Contract.  At
the  closing,  the  Company  sold CMBS  assets  with a book and market  value of
$109,220,000  and has a liability to repurchase these assets for $76,455,000 and
is non-recourse to the Company.  This repurchase  obligation has a one year term
and the  liability  balance bears  interest at specified  rates over LIBOR based
upon each asset included in the obligation.

The other new repurchase agreement,  with a securities dealer, was also utilized
to finance  CMBS  securities  that were  previously  financed  with the maturing
credit  facility  and  original  Term  Redeemable  Securities  Contract.  At the
closing,  the  Company  sold  CMBS  assets  with  a book  and  market  value  of
$44,752,000  and has a liability to repurchase  these assets for $28,056,000 and
is non-recourse to the Company.  This repurchase obligation has a 30-day rolling
term and the  liability  balance  bears  interest at specified  rates over LIBOR
based upon each asset included in the obligation.
