ITEM 1 - Business
     American National Bankshares Inc. ("the Corporation") is a one-bank holding
company, which was organized under the laws of the State of Virginia in 1984. On
September 1, 1984, the Corporation acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
of American National Bank and Trust Company ("the Bank"), a National Banking
Association chartered in 1909 under the laws of the United States. The Bank is
the only subsidiary of the Corporation. At December 31, 2000 the Corporation
employed 197 persons (FTE).

American National Bank and Trust Company
     The Bank has been operating as a commercial bank in Danville, Virginia
since its organization in 1909. On March 14, 1996, the Corporation completed the
acquisition of Mutual Savings Bank, F.S.B. ("Mutual") and Mutual was merged with
and into American National Bank and Trust Company. The Bank has two wholly owned
subsidiaries to make and sale mortgage loans and to offer non-deposit products
such as mutual funds and insurance.

     The operations of the Bank are conducted at thirteen offices located
throughout the Bank's trade area, which includes the Cities of Danville and
Martinsville, Town of South Boston, Pittsylvania, Henry, and Halifax Counties in
Virginia, Town of Yanceyville and the northern half of Caswell County in North
Carolina. Seven of these offices are located in Danville, one office each in
Gretna, Chatham, Martinsville, Collinsville, and South Boston, Virginia and
Yanceyville, North Carolina. The Bank also has fourteen automated teller
machines at various locations in the trade area. The Bank offers all services
normally offered by a full-service commercial bank, including commercial and
individual demand and time deposit accounts, commercial and individual loans and
trust services.

Competition
     The Bank's primary service area is generally defined as the Cities of
Danville and Martinsville, Town of South Boston, Pittsylvania, Henry, and
Halifax Counties in Virginia, Town of Yanceyville and the northern half of
Caswell County in North Carolina. Vigorous competition exists in this service
area. The Bank competes not only with other commercial banks but also with
diversified financial institutions, money market and mutual funds, and mortgage
and finance companies. As of March 20, 2001, there were approximately 17 banks
operating in this service area. American National Bank and Trust Company has the
largest market share in Danville and Pittsylvania County. No new banks or
savings and loan associations have been chartered in the Danville area in the
past five years. Several branch offices of existing banks have been opened in
this trade area in the past two years.

Supervision and Regulation
     The Corporation is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956 ("the Act") and is registered as such with the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("the Federal Reserve Board"). As a
bank holding company, the Corporation is required to file with the Federal
Reserve Board an annual report and such other information as may be required.
The Federal Reserve Board may also make examinations of the Corporation.

     The operations of the Bank are subject to federal statutes and to
regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board and
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures the Bank's deposits.

     The primary supervisory authority over the Bank is the Comptroller of the
Currency, which regularly examines such areas as reserves, loans, investments,
management practices and other aspects of the Bank's operations. These
examinations are designed primarily for the protection of the Bank's depositors.
In addition to these regular examinations, the Bank must furnish the Comptroller
periodic reports containing a full and accurate statement of its affairs.

     As a national bank, the Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and
is affected by general fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve
Board. The techniques used by the Federal Reserve Board include setting the
reserve requirements of member banks and establishing the discount rate on
member bank borrowings.

Government Monetary Policies and Economic Controls
     The policies of the Federal Reserve Board have a direct effect on the
amount of bank loans and deposits and the interest rates charged and paid
thereon. While current economic conditions, the policies of the Federal Reserve
Board (and other regulatory authorities) designed to deal with these conditions
and the impact of such conditions and policies upon the future business and
earnings of the Bank cannot accurately be predicted, they can materially affect
the revenues and income of commercial banks.

Foreign Operations
     The Corporation does not engage in any foreign operations.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION and
ANALYSIS of FINANCIAL CONDITION
and RESULTS of OPERATIONS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     American National Bankshares Inc. ("the Corporation") was organized in 1984
for the purpose of acquiring all of the outstanding shares of American National
Bank and Trust Company ("the Bank"). The Bank was chartered and opened for
business in February 1909. Under an agreement and plan of merger, the Bank was
acquired by the Corporation on September 1, 1984.
     The Corporation has expanded through internal growth and through mergers
and acquisitions. On March 14, 1996, the Corporation completed the merger of
Mutual Savings Bank, F.S.B. ("Mutual") with $84,718,00 in assets into the Bank.
The Mutual merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests. The Bank
completed two branch purchases in 1995 and 1996 which added $57,700,000 in
deposits and $6,925,000 in loans. The two branch purchases were accounted for as
purchases and goodwill of $4,504,000 is being amortized over ten years. The Bank
opened branch offices in Chatham and Martinsville, Virginia and closed a limited
service branch in Danville during 1999 and opened a branch office in South
Boston, Virginia during 2000.

Forward-looking Statements

     This report contains forward-looking statements with respect to the
financial condition and results of operations and business of the Corporation
and Bank. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and
are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management of the Corporation and
Bank and on information available at the time these statements and disclosures
were prepared. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from
those expected include the following:
- General economic conditions may deteriorate and negatively impact the ability
  of borrowers to repay loans and depositors to maintain balances.
- Changes in interest rates could reduce net interest income.
- Competitive pressures among financial institutions may increase.
- Legislative or regulatory changes, including changes in accounting
  standards, may adversely affect the businesses that the Corporation and
  Bank are engaged in.
- New products developed or new methods of delivering products could result in a
  reduction in business and income for the Corporation and Bank.
- Adverse changes may occur in the securities market.

Stock Split

     The Corporation issued a 2-for-1 stock split effected in the form of a 100%
stock dividend to shareholders of record July 1, 1999, payable on July 15, 1999.
All references to the number of common shares and all per share amounts have
been adjusted, as appropriate, to retroactively reflect the stock split.

Reclassifications

     Certain prior period information has been restated to conform with 2000
presentation.


Performance Summary

     The Corporation and Bank reported record profitability during 2000. Net
income of $8,676,000 for 2000 increased by $752,000 or 9.5% over net income of
$7,924,000 for 1999.
     The economy of the Bank's trade area continues to be stable as evidenced by
another year of loan growth. During 2000, net loans increased $45,404,000, or
15.7% while total deposits increased $41,030,000, or 10.6%. Total deposits and
repurchase agreements with customers increased $47,806,000, or 11.6%, during
2000. Approximately 66.5% of loan growth and 33.3% of deposit growth during 2000
occurred in the three new locations opened in 1999 and in 2000.

                                      II-8
<PAGE>
Earnings and Capital

     Net income per diluted share was $1.42 in 2000, $1.30 in 1999, and $1.18 in
1998. Shareholders' equity increased $6,619,000 in 2000 from the retention of
2000 earnings and from an increase in net unrealized gains on securities
available for sale. Shareholders' equity increased $1,858,000 in 1999 from
retention of 1999 earnings which was partially offset by an increase in net
unrealized losses on securities available for sale. This followed an increase in
shareholders' equity of $4,858,000 in 1998 from the retention of 1998 earnings
and from an increase in net unrealized gains on securities available for sale.
Shareholders' equity was 11.7% of assets at December 31, 2000 and 11.5% at
December 31, 1999. Shareholders' equity was $63,338,000 at December 31, 2000 and
$56,719,000 at December 31, 1999. The total market value of American National
Bankshares Inc. common stock at $14.50 per share (the last trade recorded on the
NASDAQ National Market during 2000) was $87,925,000. The market value of the
Corporation's common stock was 139 percent of its book value. Book value per
common share was $10.45 at the close of 2000.
     The Corporation's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
300,000 shares of the Corporation's common stock between August 16, 2000 and
August 15, 2001. The repurchases which may be made through open market purchases
or in privately negotiated transactions totaled 40,000 shares during 2000.
     The return of net income on average total assets was 1.70% in 2000 compared
to 1.68% in 1999 and 1.64% in 1998. The return on average shareholders' equity
was 14.74% in 2000 compared to 14.17% in 1999 and 13.79% in 1998.

Trends and Future Events

     The economic conditions of the Corporation's trade area remained stable
during 2000 as evidenced by another year of loan and deposit growth. The
Corporation's net loans grew at a rate of 15.7% during 2000 following a 9.0%
increase in 1999. Total deposits increased 10.6% during 2000 following a 7.6%
increase in 1999.
     Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased 11.9% to
$22,077,000 in 2000 after a 5.1% increase to $19,733,000 in 1999. The 2000
increase resulted from growth in average interest-earning assets of $40,509,000
and growth in average interest-earning liabilities of $30,321,000. The weighted
average yield on interest earning assets increased by .37% while the weighted
average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by .35% because loan
yields increased by more than interest-bearing liability yields in 2000.
Although Management believes the Corporation has positioned itself to continue
to maintain this level of net interest income into the near future, increased
competition and slowing loan and deposit growth could negatively impact net
interest income.
     During 2000, time deposits increased by $24,384,000, or 12.5%, and money
market accounts increased by $10,154,000, or 45.5%. Interest bearing demand
deposits increased $2,650,000, or 4.8%, while non-interest bearing demand
deposits increased $7,001,000 or 14.7%. Savings deposits decreased $3,159,000,
or 4.9%. Repurchase agreements which are short term investments for businesses
and individuals and are not included in deposits increased $6,776,000, or 27.2%,
during 2000. Total deposits increased $41,030,000 or 10.6% during 2000 after
increasing $27,233,000 or 7.6% during 1999.
     ANB Mortgage Corp. ("ANB Mortgage"), formerly Mutual Mortgage of the
Piedmont, Inc., was organized and began operations in 1996 as a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Bank to originate and sell mortgage loans. ANB Services Corp.
("ANB Services") was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank and began
operations in late 1999 to offer non-deposit products such as mutual funds and
insurance. The financial condition and results of operations of ANB Mortgage and
ANB Services are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated
Statements of Income of the Corporation.
     The Corporation's stock began trading on the NASDAQ National Market on
April 23, 1999 after having been traded on the OTC Bulletin Board. The change to
NASDAQ was made to improve the marketability of the stock.
     The Federal Reserve Board ("FRB") increased short-term interest rates by
increasing the federal funds target rate by 1.75% and the discount rate by 1.50%
over a period from August, 1999 to May, 2000, and major banks followed by
raising the prime lending rate by 1.75% during this same period. The increases
in interest rates in 1999 and 2000 were designed to moderate national economic
growth which could have been inflationary if left unchecked. The FRB decreased
short-term interest rates by lowering the federal funds target rate and the
discount rate by 1.00% in early 2001, and the major banks followed by decreasing
the prime lending rate by 1.00%. The FRB lowered interest rates to offset
perceived economic weaknesses which seemed to be developing in the national and
world economy.
     The FDIC insures deposits of the Bank up to the limits allowed by law.
Financial institutions are assessed deposit insurance by the FDIC at an annual
rate of between 0 and .27% of insured deposits, depending on a risk
classification. Legislation was enacted in 1996 requiring FDIC insured
institutions to pay a portion of the interest on obligations issued by the
Financing Corporation ("FICO"). For the second quarter of 2000, the effective
annual FICO assessment rate was .0202% of insured deposits.

     As mandated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Act of 1991
("FDICIA"), the following five capital categories are identified for insured
depository institutions: "well capitalized", "adequately capitalized",
"undercapitalized", "significantly undercapitalized" and "critically
undercapitalized". FDICIA requires the federal banking regulators to take prompt
corrective action with respect to insured depository institutions that do not
meet minimum capital requirements.
     Federal banking regulations have established relevant capital requirements
for bank holding companies and subsidiary banks. Under the regulations, well
capitalized institutions must have Tier I risk-based capital ratios of at least
six percent, total risk-based capital ratios of at least ten percent and
leverage ratios of at least five percent and not be subject to capital directive
orders. Under these guidelines, the Corporation and the Bank have always been
and continue to be considered well capitalized.

Year 2000 Issue

     The Corporation did not encounter computer or system problems from the
transition into the new millennium ("Year 2000"). The Year 2000 problem was
widely publicized as the possible failure or malfunction of systems or computer
chips that improperly recognized date sensitive information when the year
changed to 2000. The Corporation is not aware of Year 2000 problems encountered
by major customers, suppliers or hardware and software vendors. No liquidity
problems or material withdrawals by depositors of the Bank were experienced
during the transition into the Year 2000.
     Total Year 2000 project costs, primarily incurred before 2000, were
approximately $125,000 as had previously been estimated and disclosed. The
expenditures did not have a material impact on the Corporation's results of
operations, liquidity or capital resources.

Net Interest Income

     Net interest income, the most significant component of earnings, is the
excess of interest income over interest expense. For analytical purposes, net
interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to recognize the
income tax savings on tax-exempt assets, such as state and municipal securities.
A tax rate of 34% was used in adjusting interest on tax-exempt securities and
loans to a fully taxable equivalent basis for the years 2000, 1999 and 1998.
     During 2000, taxable equivalent net interest income increased to
$22,077,000, up 11.9% from $19,733,000 in 1999. Taxable equivalent net interest
income for 1999 was up 5.1% from $18,780,000 recorded in 1998. The $2,344,000
increase in taxable equivalent net interest income during 2000 consisted of
$1,929,000 due to increases in volume and $415,000 attributable to rate. The
$953,000 increase in taxable equivalent net interest income during 1999 was the
net result of an increase of $1,247,000 due to volume, reduced by $294,000
attributable to rate. The Bank emphasized profitable deposit pricing in 2000 as
the deposit yield increased only .31% to 4.22% while the prime rate and the
federal funds target rates increased 1% and the loan yield increased .42% to
8.98%.

Changes in Net Interest Income (Rate/Volume Analysis)

     Net interest income is the product of the volume of average earning assets
and the average rates earned, less the volume of average interest-bearing
liabilities and the average rates paid. The portion of change relating to both
rate and volume is allocated to each of the rate and volume changes based on the
relative change in each category. The following table analyzes the changes in
both rate and volume components of net interest income on a taxable equivalent
basis for the past two years (in thousands):

Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses

     The provision for loan losses is an amount added to the allowance against
which loan losses are charged. The amount of the provision is determined by
Management based upon its assessment of the size and quality of the loan
portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance in relation to the risks inherent
within the loan portfolio. The 2000 provision for loan losses was $1,020,000 and
compares with $670,000 in 1999 and $927,000 in 1998.
     The increase in the provision for loan losses in 2000 was influenced by a
15.7% increase in loans and by slightly higher net charge-offs. Net charge-offs
increased to $409,000 in 2000 from $356,000 in 1999 and $383,000 in 1998. The
allowance for loan losses totaled $4,746,000 at December 31, 2000, an increase
of 14.8% over December 31, 1999. The ratio of the allowance to loans, less
unearned income, was 1.40% at December 31, 2000 and 1.41% at December 31, 1999.
     The Bank's Loan Committee has responsibility for determining the level of
the allowance for loan losses, subject to the review of the Board of Directors.
The Loan Committee has taken economic factors, as well as any other external
events that may affect the value and collectability of the loan portfolio, into
consideration when making its assessment and recommendation.
     The methodology used to determine the level of the allowance for loan
losses on a quarterly basis includes the identification of losses from a review
of the Corporation's loan "Watch" list. In addition to these identifiable
potential losses, an experience factor for each major category of loans is
applied against the remaining portion of the loans considered to have no more
than a normal risk of collectability. Additional factors considered in
determining the level of the allowance for loan losses are identified impaired
loans, economic conditions, historical losses, uncertainties regarding new
markets, trends and other external factors that existed at the balance sheet
date. The sum of these elements is the Loan Committee's recommended level of the
allowance for loan losses.

     Management's criteria for evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for loan
losses includes individual evaluation of significant loans and overall portfolio
analyses for more homogeneous, smaller balance loan portfolios. Based on
management's evaluation, estimated loan loss allowances are assigned to the
individual loans which present a greater risk of loan loss. The remaining loan
loss allowance is allocated to the remaining loans on an overall portfolio basis
based on historical loss experience. The assessed risk of loan loss is higher in
the commercial and consumer loan categories as these categories contain loans
which are more significant to the Corporation and to the individual borrowers,
thereby exposing the Corporation to a greater risk of loss in the event of
downturns in the financial position of individual borrowers. The remaining loan
categories are typically for lesser amounts and are distributed over a much
larger population of borrowers, thereby reducing the Corporation's risk of loan
loss.

     The economy of the Corporation's trade area, which includes the City of
Danville, City of Martinsville, Town of South Boston, Pittsylvania, Henry and
Halifax Counties in Virginia, Town of Yanceyville and the northern half of
Caswell County in North Carolina, is heavily dependent on manufacturing. While
diversification has occurred in manufacturing in recent years, an apparel/home
fashions textile firm and a tire manufacturing plant in Danville employ a
significant workforce. Increased global competition has negatively impacted the
textile industry in the area with several plants closing due to competitive
pressures or due to relocation of some operations to foreign countries. Other
important industries include farming, tobacco processing and sales, food
processing, furniture manufacturing and sales, specialty glass manufacturing,
and packaging tape production.
     The local economy of the Corporation's trade area continues to remain
stable at this time and the Corporation's loan losses have not been significant
in recent years; however, an inherent risk to the loan portfolio exists if a
significant decline occurs in manufacturing along with a corresponding reduction
in employment. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is appropriate
in view of the risks inherent in Corporation's geographic region at the balance
sheet date.

Non-Interest Income

     Non-interest income totaled $4,778,000 in 2000 compared with $4,495,000 in
1999 and $4,080,000 in 1998. This was an increase of 6.3% during 2000 after an
increase of 10.2% during 1999. The major components of non-interest income are
trust and investment services, service charges on deposit accounts, other fees
and insurance commissions, mortgage banking income and other income.
     Trust and investment services which includes fees from management of
trusts, estates and investments totaled $2,658,000 in 2000, an increase of
$127,000, or 5.0%, from 1999. Trust and investment services fees in 1999
increased 16.9% from 1998. The increase in 2000 primarily resulted from new
business and the 1999 increase came from a combination of growth in investments
under management for customers due to a healthy equities market and from new
business.
     Service charges on deposit accounts were $1,114,000 in 2000, an increase of
$144,000, or 14.8%, from 1999. Service charges during 1999 totaled $970,000,
which was a 7.5% increase from 1998. A change in the fee structure and
additional accounts obtained contributed to the growth in income in 2000 and
1999. Service charge pricing on deposit accounts is typically changed annually
to reflect current costs and competition.
     Other fees and insurance commissions were $592,000 in 2000, $464,000 in
1999, and $427,000 in 1998. The increase in 2000 resulted primarily from the
addition of brokerage investment services. Non customer ATM fees, debit and
credit card fees, safe deposit box rents, brokerage investment commissions and
insurance commissions represent most of the income in this category.
     Mortgage banking income represents fees from originating and selling
residential mortgage loans through a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank which
began operations in December 1996. Mortgage banking income declined to $240,000
in 2000 from $332,000 in 1999 after peaking at $429,000 in 1998. Low
intermediate and long-term interest rates in 1998 encouraged heavy mortgage
refinancing and purchase activity by borrowers. As interest rates rose in 1999
and again in 2000, mortgage lending declined as fewer borrowers qualified for
loans or desired loans at higher rates.
     Other income was $174,000 in 2000, a decline of 11.2% from the $196,000
recorded in 1999, which in turn was an increase of 25.6% from $156,000 recorded
in 1998. Other income in 1999 included $94,000 in gains from the sale of real
estate owned, and 1998 other income included a gain of $104,000 from a life
insurance settlement. Check order income and dividends from equity investments
in two insurance companies account for over 90% of 2000 other income.

Non-Interest Expense

     Non-interest expense of $12,930,000 in 2000, increased $1,387,000, or
12.0%, over $11,543,000 in 1999, which in turn increased $529,000, or 4.8%, over
$11,014,000 in 1998. Non-interest expense includes salaries, pension and other
employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense, core deposit intangible
amortization and other expenses.
     Salaries of $6,071,000 in 2000 increased $496,000, or 8.9%, over 1999 due
primarily to additional compensation for new branch offices in South Boston for
one quarter and Martinsville for a full year versus four months in 1999 and due
to merit increases. Salaries of $5,575,000 in 1999 increased $448,000, or 8.7%,
over 1998 due to new branch offices in Chatham and Martinsville and due to
increased incentive compensation and merit increases.
     Pension and other employee benefits totaled $1,154,000 in 2000, an increase
of 20.8% from the $955,000 recorded in 1999, which in turn was a decrease of
16.2% from the $1,140,000 reported in 1998. The decline in 1999 resulted from a
decrease in supplemental retirement expense.
     Occupancy and equipment expense of $2,189,000 for 2000 increased $293,000,
or 15.5%, over $1,896,000 recorded in 1999 which increased 13.9% from $1,664,000
recorded in 1998. The higher occupancy and equipment expense resulted from the
addition of three new branches in 1999 and 2000 and from higher depreciation,
maintenance and licensing fees on new technology equipment designed to improve
product delivery and increase productivity.

                                      II-14
<PAGE>
     Core deposit intangible expense represents amortization of premiums paid
for deposits at the Yanceyville and Gretna offices which is calculated on a
straight line basis over ten years.
     Other expense was $3,066,000 in 2000, an increase of 15.0% over the
$2,667,000 reported in 1999 which increased from $2,633,000 recorded in 1998.
The 2000 increase primarily resulted from expenses related to three new branches
opened in 1999 and 2000 and from related income growth.
     The efficiency ratio, a productivity measure used to determine how well
non-interest expense is managed, was 46.5%, 45.8%, and 46.2% for 2000, 1999, and
1998, respectively. A lower efficiency ratio indicates more favorable expense
efficiency. Leaders in expense efficiency in the banking industry have achieved
ratios in the mid-to-high 40% range while the majority of the industry remains
in the 55-65% range. The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non-interest
expense, excluding intangible amortization, by the sum of taxable equivalent net
interest income and non-interest income.

Income Taxes

     The provision for income taxes (total of current and deferred) was
$3,415,000 in 2000, compared with $3,320,000 in 1999 and $3,123,000 in 1998. In
each year, the Corporation was subject to a Federal tax rate of 34%. The major
difference between the statutory rate and the effective rate results from income
which is not taxable for Federal income tax purposes. The primary non-taxable
income is that of state and municipal securities and industrial revenue bonds or
loans. Refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
reconciliation of the statutory Federal income tax rate of 34% to the effective
tax rates for 2000, 1999, and 1998.

Capital Management

     Regulatory agencies issued risk-based capital guidelines which were fully
effective in 1992. The guidelines were established to more appropriately
consider the credit risk inherent in the assets and off-balance sheet activities
of a financial institution in the assessment of capital adequacy.
     Under the guidelines, total capital has been defined as core (Tier I)
capital and supplementary (Tier II) capital. The Corporation's Tier I capital
consists primarily of shareholder's equity, while Tier II capital consists of
the allowance for loan losses. The definition of assets has been modified to
include items on and off the balance sheet, with each item being assigned a
"risk-weight" for the determination of the ratio of capital to risk-adjusted
assets.
     The guidelines require that total capital (Tier I and Tier II) of 8% be
held against total risk-adjusted assets, at least half of which (4%) must be
Tier I capital. At December 31, 2000, the Corporation's Tier I and total capital
ratios were 16.02% and 17.09%, respectively. At December 31, 1999, these ratios
were 16.57% and 17.79%, respectively. The ratios for both years were well in
excess of the regulatory requirements.
     The Corporation's leverage ratios (Tier 1 capital divided by average
quarterly assets less intangible assets) were 11.59% and 11.52% at December 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively. The leverage ratio has a regulatory minimum of 3%,
with most institutions required to maintain a ratio 100 to 200 basis points
above the 3% minimum depending upon risk profiles and other factors.
     The Corporation's 2000 capital formation rate (net income less dividends
declared, divided by average shareholders' equity) was 8.7%. This compares with
8.4% in 1999 and in 1998. These ratios evidence the Corporation's attainment of
its goal of meeting future capital requirements by retaining a portion of
operating earnings while providing steadily increasing cash dividends.
     Prior to 1996 the Corporation paid cash dividends on a semi-annual basis.
In 1996 the Corporation began paying dividends on a quarterly basis and the
Board of Directors declared regular quarterly dividends totaling $.585 and $.525
per share of common stock in 2000 and 1999, respectively.
     The Board of Directors reviews the Corporation's dividend policy regularly
and increases dividends when justified by earnings after considering future
capital needs.

Asset and Liability Management

     The Corporation's primary objectives for asset and liability management are
to identify opportunities to maximize net interest income while ensuring
adequate liquidity and carefully managing interest rate risk. The
Asset/Liability Investment Committee ("ALCO"), which is primarily composed of
executive officers, is responsible for:
-  Monitoring  corporate  financial performance;
-  Meeting  liquidity  requirements;
-  Establishing  interest rate parameters, indices, and terms for loan and
   deposit products;
-  Assessing and evaluating the competitive rate environment;
-  Reviewing and approving investment portfolio transactions under established
   policy guidelines;
-  Monitoring and measuring interest rate risk.

Liquidity
     Liquidity is the measure of the Corporation's ability to generate
sufficient funds to meet customer demands for loans and the withdrawal of
deposit balances. The Corporation, in its normal course of business, maintains
cash reserves and has an adequate flow of funds from loan payments and maturing
investment securities to meet present liquidity needs.
     Management monitors and plans the Corporation's liquidity position for
future periods. Liquidity is provided from cash and amounts due from banks,
federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, repayments from
loans, seasonal increases in deposits, lines of credit from two federal agency
banks and a correspondent bank and maturing investments. Management believes
that these factors provide sufficient and timely liquidity for the foreseeable
future.
     Expansion of the Corporation's earning assets is based largely on the
growth of deposits from individuals and small and medium size businesses. These
deposits are more stable in number and size than large denomination certificates
of deposit. In addition, the Corporation's customers have relatively stable
requirements for funds.
     The Corporation's major source of funds and liquidity is its deposit base.
The mix of the deposit base (time deposits versus demand, money market and
savings) is constantly subject to change. During 2000, as shown in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, the deposit mix changed with an increase in higher
cost time deposits of $24,384,000, an increase in demand deposits of $9,651,000,
a decline in savings deposits of $3,159,000 and an increase in money market
accounts of $10,154,000. Deposit mix trends in 1999 were similar to 2000, except
growth in money market and demand deposits were higher in 2000 than in 1999.
     The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows appearing in the financial
statement section shows a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of
$7,780,000 during 2000. This increase was the result of a combination of
$9,905,000 provided by operating activities, $40,804,000 net cash used in
investing activities, and $38,679,000 net cash provided by financing activities.
A net increase in deposits and repurchase agreements provided cash from
financing activities while cash dividends paid, repurchase of stock and a
reduction in FHLB borrowings used net cash in financing activities. The cash
provided by operating and financing activities, more than adequately supplied
the Corporation's liquidity needs at all times during 2000.
     Liquidity strategies are implemented and monitored by ALCO on a day to day
basis. The Committee uses a simulation model to assess the future liquidity
needs of the Corporation and manage the investment of funds.

Interest Rate Risk
     Interest rate risk refers to the exposure of the Corporation's earnings and
market value of portfolio equity ("MVE") to changes in interest rates. The
magnitude of the change in earnings and MVE resulting from interest rate changes
is impacted by the time remaining to maturity on fixed-rate obligations, the
contractual ability to adjust rates prior to maturity, competition, the general
level of interest rates and customer actions.
     There are several common sources of interest rate risk that must be
effectively managed if there is to be minimal impact on the Corporation's
earnings and capital. Repricing risk arises largely from timing differences in
the pricing of assets and liabilities. Reinvestment risk refers to the
reinvestment of cash flows from interest payments and maturing assets at lower
or higher rates. Basis risk exists when different yield curves or pricing
indices do not change at precisely the same time or in the same magnitude such
that assets and liabilities with the same maturity are not all affected equally.
Yield curve risk refers to unequal movements in interest rates across a full
range of maturities.
     In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, ALCO reviews
the changes in net interest income and MVE given various changes in interest
rates. The Corporation also considers the most likely interest rate scenarios,
local economics, liquidity needs, business strategies, and other factors in
determining the appropriate levels of interest rate risk. To effectively measure
and manage interest rate risk, interest rate sensitivity and simulation analysis
are used to determine the impact on net interest income and MVE from changes in
interest rates.
     Interest rate sensitivity analysis presents the amount of assets and
liabilities that are estimated to reprice through specified periods if there are
not changes in balance sheet mix. The interest rate sensitivity table, below,
reflects the Corporation's assets and liabilities on December 31, 2000 that will
either be repriced in accordance with market rates, mature or are estimated to
mature early or prepay within the periods indicated.

     Because of inherent limitations in interest rate sensitivity analysis, ALCO
uses more sophisticated interest rate risk measurement techniques. Simulation
analysis is used to subject the current repricing conditions to rising and
falling interest rates in increments and decrements of 1%, 2% and 3% to
determine how net interest income changes for the next twelve months. ALCO also
measures the effects of changes in interest rates on the MVE by discounting
future cash flows of deposits and loans using new rates at which deposits and
loans would be made to similar depositors and borrowers. Market value changes on
the investment portfolio are estimated by discounting future cash flows and
using duration analysis. Loan and investment security prepayments are estimated
using current market information. The following table shows the estimated impact
of changes in interest rates up and down 1%, 2% and 3% on net interest income
and on MVE.

     The negative one year cumulative interest sensitivity gap of $79,443,000 in
the interest rate sensitivity analysis normally implies that the Corporation's
net interest income would rise if rates decline and fall if rates increase. The
simulation analysis presents a more accurate picture since certain rate indices
that reprice deposits do not change with the same magnitude over the same period
of time as changes in the prime or indices that reprice many loans.
     While the Corporation cannot predict future interest rates or their effects
on MVE or net interest income, the above analysis indicates that a change in
interest rates of plus or minus 3% is unlikely to have a material adverse effect
on net interest income and MVE in future periods. Computations of prospective
effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions,
including relative levels of market interest rates, asset and liability
prepayments and composition and should not be relied upon as indicative of
actual results. Certain limitations are inherent in such computations. Certain
assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market
interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities
may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on
other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest
rates. In the event of a change in interest rates, loan prepayments and early
deposit withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in
making the calculations set forth above. Additionally, credit risk may increase
if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of many borrowers to
service their debt.

Investment Portfolio

     The investment portfolio consists primarily of securities for which an
active market exists. The Bank's policy is to invest primarily in securities of
the U. S. Government and its agencies and in other high grade fixed income
securities to minimize credit risk.
     At December 31, 2000 securities available for sale (at amortized cost)
totaled $119,864,000 and included $77,506,000 in federal agencies, $18,270,000
in state and municipal, and $24,088,000 in other securities. A net unrealized
gain of $489,000 related to these securities at December 31, 2000. At December
31, 1999, securities available for sale (at amortized cost) totaled $124,519,000
and included $7,002,000 in U.S. Government securities, $77,016,000 in federal
agencies, $19,324,000 in state and municipal and $21,177,000 in other
securities. A net unrealized loss of $2,647,000 related to these securities at
December 31, 1999.
     Securities held to maturity totaled $42,576,000 and $44,400,000 at December
31, 2000 and 1999, respectively and had respective estimated fair values of
$42,920,000 and $43,634,000. Of the amount at December 31, 2000, $21,958,000 or
51.6% were federal agencies and $20,618,000 or 48.4% were state and municipal
securities. Securities held to maturity at December 31, 2000 consisted of
$10,855,000 due in one year or less, $13,337,000 due after one year through five
years, $12,534,000 due in five years through ten years and $5,850,000 due after
ten years. The state and municipal securities were diversified among many
different issues and localities.
     The market value of securities held to maturity at December 31, 2000 was
more than the book value by $344,000. No losses are anticipated since the
Corporation has the ability and intent to hold these securities until their
respective maturities.

Loan Portfolio

     Loans, net of unearned income increased $46,015,000 or 15.7% during 2000.
As shown in schedule A on page II-20, the primary increases in types of loans in
2000 were real estate loans secured by 1 - 4 family residential properties, real
estate loans secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties and commercial and
industrial loans. The loan portfolio is diversified and consists of 60.2%
mortgage loans, 26.7% commercial loans and 13.1% consumer loans.
     Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements presents related party
loan activity. A substantial portion of the loan additions and payments result
from floorplan activity by two automobile dealerships owned separately by two of
the Corporation's Directors.
     The Corporation does not participate in highly leveraged lending
transactions, as defined by the bank regulators and there are no loans of this
nature recorded in the loan portfolio. The Corporation has no foreign loans in
its portfolio.

Real Estate Loans

     Commercial real estate loans have received considerable attention in recent
years by the bank regulators and the news media. The concerns have been in real
estate values in certain areas of the country and the quality of banks'
commercial real estate portfolios. It is difficult to measure commercial real
estate values within the Corporation's trade area due to the light sales
activity. Commercial real estate values did not escalate to levels seen in other
areas of the state and country during the ten years prior to the last recession
and management has not detected a significant change in values within the
Corporation's trade area during 2000 or 1999. Management has confined its real
estate lending to its trade area and has always taken a conservative approach in
its lending practice to maintain equity in real estate loans.

     The total of outstanding real estate loans at December 31, 2000 was
$204,684,000. This consisted of $121,449,000 or 59.3% in loans secured by 1-4
family residential properties, $67,312,000 or 32.9% in loans secured by
non-farm, non-residential properties, $9,284,000 or 4.5% in construction and
land development, $1,616,000 or .8% in loans secured by farmland and $5,023,000
of other real estate loans.
     Nonperforming real estate loans at December 31, 2000 and 1999 were $65,000
and $107,000, respectively. There were no real estate loans on accrual status
and past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2000 and $3,000 at December 31,
1999.

Asset Quality

     The Corporation identifies specific credit exposures through its periodic
analysis of the loan portfolio and monitors general exposures from economic
trends, market values and other external factors. The Corporation maintains an
allowance for loan losses, which is available to absorb losses inherent in the
loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for losses and by
recoveries from losses. Charge-offs decrease the allowance. The adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses is determined on a quarterly basis. Various factors as
defined in the previous section "Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses" are
considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance.
     Loans, other than consumer, are generally placed on nonaccrual status when
any portion of principal or interest is 90 days past due or collectability is
uncertain. Unless loans are in the process of collection, income recognized on
consumer loans is discontinued and the loans are charged off after a delinquency
of 90 days. Under the Corporation's policy a nonaccruing loan may be restored to
accrual status when none of its principal and interest is due and unpaid and the
Corporation expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and
interest or when it otherwise becomes well secured and in the process of
collection.
     Nonperforming assets include loans on which interest is no longer accrued,
loans classified as troubled debt restructurings and foreclosed properties.
Foreclosed properties were $30,000, $30,000 and $385,000 at December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively.
     At December 31, 2000 and 1999, loans in a nonaccrual or restructured status
totaled approximately $146,000 and $292,000, respectively. As shown in schedule
C on page II-22, loans on accrual status and past due 90 days or more have
decreased to $239,000 in 2000 from $287,000 in 1999. The total of nonperforming
loans and loans past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2000 was $385,000, a
decrease of $194,000 from the $579,000 reported at December 31, 1999. Net
charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were .13% in 2000 and 1999.
Management considers charge-off levels of .10% to .40% to be within reasonable
norms from a historical perspective.
     Management has in place an aggressive program to control loan
delinquencies, and the level of past due loans and nonperforming loans is
considered to be within an acceptable range. Total nonperforming loans and loans
past due 90 days or more represent .11% of total loans at December 31, 2000 and
 .20% at December 31, 1999. Total nonperforming loans and past due loans 90 days
or more on an accrual status is considered low by industry standards.

     Certain short term loans and demand loans within the commercial, financial
and agricultural classifications are anticipated to be curtailed prior to any
renewal. Normally these loans are expected to be paid within one year and all
such loans have been classified within the one year category. Any rollovers
allowed depend upon the Bank's loan policy after a reappraisal of the borrower's
creditworthiness at the date of maturity.

     The allowance for loan losses is based upon the quality of loans as
determined by management taking into consideration historical loan loss
experience, diversification of the loan portfolio, amount of secured and
unsecured loans, banking industry standards and averages, and general economic
conditions. At the time that collection of the outstanding balance of specific
loans together with related interest is considered doubtful, such loans are
placed in a nonaccuring status.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices

     The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are
monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most industrial companies
that have significant investments in fixed assets. Due to this fact, the effects
of inflation on the Corporation's balance sheet are minimal, meaning that there
are no substantial increases or decreases in net purchasing power over time. The
most significant effect of inflation is on other expenses which tend to rise
during periods of general inflation.
     Management feels that the most significant impact on financial results is
changes in interest rates and the Corporation's ability to react to those
changes. As discussed previously, management is attempting to measure, monitor
and control interest rate risk.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



     The following consolidated financial statements and related notes to
consolidated financial statements of American National Bankshares Inc. and
Subsidiary were prepared by Management which has the primary responsibility for
the integrity of the financial information. The statements have been prepared in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the
circumstances and include amounts that are based on Management's best estimates
and judgement. Financial information elsewhere in this Annual Report is
presented on a basis consistent with that in the financial statements.
     In meeting its responsibility for the fair presentation of the financial
statements, Management relies on the Corporation's comprehensive system of
internal accounting controls. This system provides reasonable assurance that
assets are safeguarded and transactions are recorded to permit the preparation
of appropriate financial information. The system of internal controls is
characterized by an effective control-oriented environment within the
Corporation which is augmented by written policies and procedures, internal
audits and the careful selection and training of qualified personnel.
     The functioning of the accounting system and related internal accounting
controls is under the general oversight of the Audit and Compliance Committee of
the Board of Directors which is comprised of three outside directors. The
accounting system and related controls are reviewed by an extensive program of
internal audits. The Audit and Compliance Committee meets regularly with the
internal auditors to review their work and ensure that they are properly
discharging their responsibilities. In addition, the Committee reviews and
approves the scope and timing of the internal audits and any findings with
respect to the system of internal controls. The Audit and Compliance Committee
also meets periodically with representatives of Arthur Andersen LLP, the
Corporation's independent public accountants, to discuss the results of their
audit as well as other audit and financial matters. Reports of examinations
conducted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are also reviewed by
the committee members.
     The responsibility of Arthur Andersen LLP is limited to an expression of
their opinion as to the fairness of the financial statements presented. Their
opinion is based on an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards as described in the second paragraph of their report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To American National Bankshares Inc.:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American
National Bankshares Inc. (a Virginia corporation) and Subsidiary as of December
31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.
     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                        December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998

                American National Bankshares Inc. and Subsidiary




1.  Summary of Accounting Policies:


Consolidation
     The consolidated financial statements include the amounts and results of
operations of American National Bankshares Inc. ("the Corporation") and its
wholly owned subsidiary, American National Bank and Trust Company ("the Bank").
The Bank offers a wide variety of retail, commercial and trust banking services
through its offices located in the trade area of the Cities of Danville and
Martinsville, Town of South Boston, the Counties of Pittsylvania, Henry, and
Halifax in Virginia and the County of Caswell in North Carolina. ANB Mortgage
Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank, commenced mortgage lending
operations in December 1996. ANB Services Corp., another wholly owned subsidiary
of the Bank, was formed in October 1999 to offer non-deposit products such as
mutual funds and insurance products. All significant intercompany transactions
and accounts are eliminated in consolidation.


Investment Securities
     The  Corporation   classifies   investment   securities  in  one  of  three
categories: held to maturity, available for sale and trading.
     Debt securities acquired with both the intent and ability to be held to
maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost.
     Securities which may be used to meet liquidity needs arising from
unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations, changes in regulatory capital and
investment requirements, or unforeseen changes in market conditions, including
interest rates, market values or inflation rates, are classified as available
for sale. Securities available for sale are reported at estimated fair value,
with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of
shareholders' equity, net of tax. Gains or losses realized from the sale of
securities available for sale are determined by specific identification and are
included in non-interest income.
     The Corporation does not permit the purchase or sale of trading account
securities.
     Premiums and discounts on investment securities are amortized using the
interest method.


Loans
     Loans are stated at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned
income. Mortgage, consumer and commercial loans accrue interest on the unpaid
balance of the loans. The net amount of nonrefundable loan origination fees and
direct costs associated with the lending process are deferred and amortized to
interest income over the contractual lives of the loans using the effective
interest method.


Allowance for Loan Losses
     The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of losses inherent in the loan
portfolio as determined by management taking into consideration identified
impaired loans, historical loan loss experience, diversification of the loan
portfolio, amounts of secured and unsecured loans, banking industry standards
and averages, and general economic conditions. Ultimate losses may vary from
current estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically and as adjustments
become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they
become reasonably estimable.


Bank Premises and Equipment
     Additions and major replacements are added to bank premises and equipment
at cost. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense when incurred.
Premises and equipment are depreciated using primarily accelerated methods over
estimated lives generally as follows: buildings, 10 to 50 years; and furniture
and equipment, 3 to 10 years.


Intangible Assets
     Premiums paid on acquisitions of deposits (core deposit intangibles) are
included in other assets in the "Consolidated Balance Sheets". Such assets are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years. At December 31, 2000,
the Bank had $2,284,000 recorded as core deposit intangibles, net of
amortization. The Bank recorded core deposit intangible amortization of
approximately $450,000 for each of the three years ended December 31, 2000. Core
deposit intangibles are periodically reviewed for impairment. As of December 31,
2000, no impairment had been identified.

                                      II-32
<PAGE>
Foreclosed Properties
     Foreclosed properties are included in other assets and represent other real
estate that has been acquired through loan or in-substance foreclosures or deeds
received in lieu of loan payments. Generally, such properties are appraised
annually, and they are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less
estimated selling costs. When appropriate, adjustments to cost are charged or
credited to the allowance for foreclosed properties.


Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


Income Taxes
     The Corporation uses the asset and liability method to account for income
taxes. The objective of the asset and liability method is to establish deferred
tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial
reporting basis and the income tax basis of the Corporation's assets and
liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are
realized or settled.


Earnings Per Share
     The Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 128, "Earnings Per Share", in 1998. This statement requires the
dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share which are equal for
the Corporation for all periods presented. No restatement of prior periods was
required.
     The Corporation issued a 2-for-1 stock split effected in the form of a 100%
stock dividend to shareholders of record July 1, 1999, payable on July 15, 1999.
All references to the number of common shares and all per share amounts have
been adjusted, as appropriate, to retroactively reflect the stock split.

Reclassifications
     Certain reclassifications have been made in prior years' financial
statements to conform to classifications used in the current year.

New Accounting Pronouncements.
     In February 1998, SFAS No. 132,  "Employers'  Disclosures about Pension and
Other Postretirement Benefits", was issued, amending FASB Statements No. 87, 88,
and 106.  This  Statement  does not change the  measurement  or  recognition  of
pension  and   postretirement   benefit   plans  but   standardizes   disclosure
requirements.  The new disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 132 have been adopted
and are included in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
     In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities", which establishes accounting and reporting
standards requiring balance sheet recognition of all derivative instruments at
fair value. SFAS No. 133 was subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 in June 1999
and by SFAS No. 138 in June 2000. The statement, as amended, specifies that
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in
earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting
for qualifying hedges allows derivative gains and losses to offset related
results on hedged items in the income statement. Companies must formally
document, designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions utilizing hedge
accounting. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2000. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Corporation.
     In September 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishment of Liabilities". This statement revises the criteria for
accounting for securitizations, other financial-assets transfers and collateral
and introduces new disclosures. This statement is effective for fiscal years
ending after March 31, 2001. The adoption of this statement is not expected to
have a material effect on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements.

     Loans, other than consumer, are generally placed on nonaccrual status when
any portion of principal or interest is 90 days past due or collectability is
uncertain. Unless loans are in the process of collection, income recognition on
consumer loans is discontinued and the loans are charged off after a delinquency
of 90 days. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, loans in a nonaccrual or restructured
status totaled approximately $146,000 and $292,000, respectively.
     Interest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recorded on a cash
basis. For the years 2000, 1999 and 1998, the gross amount of interest income
that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans and restructured loans, if all
such loans had been accruing interest at the original contractual rate, was
$15,000, $23,000 and $14,000, respectively. No interest payments were recorded
in 2000, 1999 or 1998 as interest income for all such nonperforming loans.
     Under the Corporation's policy a nonaccruing loan may be restored to
accrual status when none of its principal and interest is due and unpaid and the
Corporation expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and
interest or when it otherwise becomes well secured and in the process of
collection.
     As of January 1, 1995, the Bank adopted SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan", which was amended by SFAS No. 118,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan-Income Recognition and
Disclosures". SFAS No. 114, as amended, requires that impaired loans be measured
based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
loan's effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient, at the loan's
observable market price or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is
collateral-dependent. When the measure of the impaired loan is less than the
recorded investment in the loan, the impairment is recorded through a valuation
allowance. The Bank had previously measured the allowance for loan losses using
methods similar to those prescribed in SFAS No. 114. As a result of adopting
these statements, no additional allowance for loan losses was required as of
January 1, 1995.

     For purposes of applying SFAS No. 114, commercial loans on nonaccrual
status are evaluated for impairment on an individual basis. Management assesses
the current economic condition and the historical repayment patterns of the
creditor in determining whether delays in repayment on the loans are considered
to be insignificant shortfalls or indicators of impairment. Those loans for
which management considers it probable that the Bank will be unable to collect
all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement are
considered to be impaired. All loans made by the Bank other than commercial
loans are excluded from the scope of SFAS No. 114 as they are considered
smaller-balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for
impairment. Interest income is recognized on impaired loans in the same manner
as loans on nonaccrual status. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Bank had
not identified any loans as impaired.
     The loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in the immediate geographic
region which is the Corporation's trade area consisting of the Cities of
Danville and Martinsville, Town of South Boston, and Pittsylvania, Henry, and
Halifax Counties in Virginia, Town of Yanceyville and the northern half of
Caswell County in North Carolina. There were no concentrations of loans to any
individual, group of individuals, businesses or industry that exceeded 10% of
the outstanding loans at December 31, 2000.
     An analysis of the allowance for loan losses is as follows (in thousands):

5.  Time Deposits:
     Included in time deposits are certificates of deposit in denominations of
$100,000 or more totaling $56,361,000, $45,887,000 and $32,851,000 at December
31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Interest expense on such deposits during
2000, 1999 and 1998 was $2,781,000, $1,566,000 and $1,436,000, respectively.


6.  Short-Term Borrowings:
     Repurchase agreements of $31,730,000 and $24,954,000 comprised short-term
borrowings at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Repurchase agreements
are borrowings collateralized by securities of the U.S. Government or its
agencies and mature daily. In addition, the Bank has 15% of assets, or
approximately $81,140,000, in credit availability with the FHLB at December 31,
2000 which is secured by qualifying mortgages or other acceptable security.

7.  Stock Options:
     The Company uses the intrinsic value method in determining compensation
expense for stock options which represents the excess of the market price of
stock over the exercise price on the measurement date. Since the exercise price
of all options granted was equal to or exceeded the market value of the stock at
the date of grant, no compensation expense has been recognized.

     The provision for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):

                                   2000         1999        1998

                                 ========     ========    ========

     The effective rates of the provision differ from the statutory federal
income tax rates due to the following items:

                                  2000         1999        1998

                                 ======       ======      ======


9.  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities:
     The consolidated financial statements do not reflect various commitments
and contingent liabilities which arise in the normal course of business to meet
the financing needs of customers. These include commitments to extend credit and
standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees,
elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk in excess of the amount
recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The extent of the Bank's
involvement in various commitments or contingent liabilities is expressed by the
contract or notional amounts of such instruments.
     Commitments to extend credit, which amounted to $85,489,000 and $86,931,000
at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, represent legally binding
agreements to lend to a customer with fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire
without being funded, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent
future liquidity requirements.
     There were $800,000 in commitments to purchase securities when issued at
December 31, 2000 and none at December 31, 1999.
     Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank
guaranteeing the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees
are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. At
December 31, 2000 and 1999 the Bank had $1,531,000 and $1,193,000 in outstanding
standby letters of credit. Commercial letters of credit amounted to $60,000 at
December 31, 2000.
     Management and the Corporation's counsel are not aware of any pending
litigation against the Corporation and believe that there are no contingent
liabilities outstanding that will result in a material adverse effect on the
Corporation's consolidated financial position or consolidated results of
operations.
     The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and is required to
maintain certain levels of its cash and due from bank balances as reserves based
on regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2000, this reserve requirement was
approximately $1,821,000.


10.  Related Party Transactions:
     The Directors provide the Bank with substantial amounts of business, and
many are among its largest depositors and borrowers. The total amount of loans
outstanding to the executive officers, directors and their business interests
was $14,793,000 and $10,188,000 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The
maximum amount of loans outstanding to the officers, directors and their
business interests at any month-end during 2000, 1999 and 1998 was approximately
4.5% of gross loans. Management believes that all such loans are made on
substantially the same terms, including interest rates, as those prevailing at
the time for comparable loans to similar, unrelated borrowers, and do not
involve more than a normal risk of collectability. As of December 31, 2000, none
of these loans were restructured, nor were any related party loans charged off
during 2000. An analysis of these loans for 2000 is as follows (in thousands):

Balance, beginning of year          $ 10,188
  Additions                           27,857
  Repayments                         (23,252)
                                    ---------
Balance, end of year                $ 14,793
                                    =========


11.  Employee Benefit Plans:
     The Bank's retirement plan is a non-contributory defined benefit pension
plan which covers substantially all employees of the Bank who are 21 years of
age or older and who have had at least one year of service. Advanced funding is
accomplished by using the actuarial cost method known as the collective
aggregate cost method.

     A non-contributory deferred compensation plan was adopted in 1982 by the
Board of Directors of the Bank which covers certain key executives. The expense
for this plan was $110,000, $63,000 and $151,000 for years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
     A 401(k) savings plan was adopted in 1995 which covers substantially all
full-time employees of the Bank. The Bank matches a portion of the contribution
made by employee participants after at least one year of service. The Bank
contributed $110,000, $108,000 and $92,000 to the 401(k) plan in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. These amounts are included in pension and other employee
benefits expense for the respective years.

     The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate
that value:


Cash and federal funds sold
     The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.


Investment securities and other
     For marketable securities held for investment purposes, fair values are
based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes. For other securities held as
investments, fair value equals market price, if available. If a quoted market
price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for
similar securities.


Other Assets
     The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.


Loans
     Due to the repricing characteristics of revolving credit lines, home equity
loans and adjustable demand loans, the carrying amount of these loans is a
reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair value of other types of loans is
estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which
similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the
same remaining maturities. Prepayment rates are taken into consideration in the
calculation.

                                      II-41
<PAGE>
Deposits
     The fair value of demand deposits, savings deposits, and money market
deposits equals the carrying value. The fair value of fixed-maturity
certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using
the current rates at which similar deposit instruments would be offered to
depositors for the same remaining maturities at current rates.


Federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements The carrying amount is a
     reasonable estimate of fair value.


Other Liabilities
     The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.


Off balance sheet instruments
     The fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated using the fees
currently charged (if any) to enter into agreements, taking into account the
remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the
counterparties. At December 31, 2000 no fees were charged for commitments to
extend credit. All such commitments were subject to current market rates and
pose no known credit exposure. As a result, no fair value has been estimated for
these commitments.
     The fair value of letters of credit is based on fees currently charged for
similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise
settle the obligations with the counterparties at the reporting date.


13. Dividend Restrictions and Capital:
     The approval of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if the total of
all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year exceeds the
bank's net income, as defined, for that year combined with its retained net
income for the preceding two calendar years. Under this formula, the Bank can
distribute as dividends, without the approval of the Comptroller of the
Currency, $8,259,000 plus an additional amount equal to the Bank's net income
for 2000 up to the date of any dividend declaration.
     Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
require the Corporation and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of
total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets
(as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. At December 31, 2000 and
1999 these ratios were above the minimums as follows (in thousands):

14. Segment and Related Information:
     The Corporation adopted SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information", in 1998. Comparable prior period
information is presented. Reportable segments include community banking and
trust and investment services. Community banking involves making loans to and
generating deposits from individuals and businesses in the markets where the
Bank has offices. All assets and liabilities of the Bank are allocated to
community banking. Investment income from fixed income investments is a major
source of income in addition to loan interest income. Service charges from
deposit accounts and non-deposit fees such as automatic teller machine fees and
insurance commissions generate additional income for community banking.
     Trust and investment services includes estate and trust planning and
administration and investment management for various entities. The trust and
investment services division of the Bank manages trusts, estates and purchases
equity, fixed income and mutual fund investments for customer accounts. The
trust and investment services division receives fees for investment and
administrative services. Fees are also received by this division for individual
retirement accounts managed for the community banking segment.
     The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
the summary of significant accounting policies. All intersegment sales prices
are market based.
     Segment information for the years 2000, 1999 and 1998 is shown in the
following table (in thousands). The "Other" column includes corporate related
items, results of insignificant operations and, as it relates to segment profit
(loss), income and expense not allocated to reportable segments. Intersegment
eliminations primarily consist of the Corporation's investment in the Bank and
related equity earnings.

                         Annual Meeting of Shareholders
                            To be held April 24, 2001

                                  INTRODUCTION


     This Proxy Statement is furnished in conjunction  with the  solicitation by
the Board of Directors of American National  Bankshares Inc. (the "Corporation")
of the  accompanying  proxy to be used at the Annual Meeting of  Shareholders of
the Corporation  and at any  adjournments  thereof.  The meeting will be held on
Tuesday,  April 24, 2001,  11:30 a.m., at The Wednesday  Club, 1002 Main Street,
Danville, Virginia, for the purposes set forth below and in the Notice of Annual
Meeting of Shareholders.  Shares represented by properly executed proxy, if such
proxies  are  received  in time and not  revoked,  will be  voted at the  Annual
Meeting as set forth therein.

                       INFORMATION AS TO VOTING SECURITIES

     The Board of Directors has set March 9, 2001 as the record date for the
determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual
Meeting. Only shareholders of record on that date will be entitled to vote on
the matters described herein. As of March 9, 2001, the Corporation had 1,385
shareholders of record. To the Corporation's knowledge, no one individual or
entity owns directly or indirectly more than 5% of the Corporation's common
stock ("the Common Stock") except Ambro and Company, the nominee name in which
American National Bank and Trust Company (the "Bank"), the Corporation's banking
subsidiary, registers securities it holds in a fiduciary capacity, which held
1,195,151 shares on March 9, 2001.

     The number of shares of the Common Stock, there being no other class of
stock, outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting is
6,030,772. There are 1,195,151 shares held of record by Ambro and Company which
amount represents 19.8175% of the outstanding securities, and only 431,666 of
these shares may be voted by the existing co-fiduciaries. The remaining shares
may not be voted by the Bank but co-fiduciaries may be qualified for the sole
purpose of voting all or a portion of the shares at the Annual Meeting.

     A majority of the votes entitled to be cast on matters to be considered at
the Annual Meeting constitutes a quorum. If a share is represented for any
purpose at the Annual Meeting, it is deemed to be present for quorum purposes
for all matters considered at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and shares held of
record by a broker or its nominee ("Broker Shares") that are voted on any matter
are included in determining the number of votes present or represented at the
Annual Meeting. Broker Shares that are not voted on any matter at the Annual
Meeting will not be included in determining whether a quorum is present.
Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by holders of the Common
Stock at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Votes that are withheld and
Broker Shares that are not voted in the election of directors will not be
included in determining the number of votes cast.

     This proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy were first mailed to
shareholders on or about March 22, 2001.

                                VOTING OF PROXIES

     If the enclosed proxy is properly executed, dated, returned and not
revoked, it will be voted in accordance with the specification made by the
shareholder. If a specification is not made, it will be voted "FOR" the
proposals set forth below and in the notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Shareholder's may revoke their proxy by delivering a written notice of
revocation to the Corporation at its principal office to the attention of T.
Allen Liles, Secretary, at any time before the proxy is exercised or by
attending the meeting and voting in person. Richard G. Barkhouser, H. Dan Davis,
or James A. Motley, or any of them, will act as proxies on behalf of the Board
of Directors.

                            EXPENSES OF SOLICITATION

     The Corporation will pay the cost of preparing, assembling and mailing this
Proxy Statement and the enclosed material. Proxies may also be solicited
personally or by telephone by the Corporation and the Bank's officers without
additional compensation.

                         PURPOSES OF THE ANNUAL MEETING

     As set forth in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Board of
Directors is seeking proxies in connection with the following proposals to be
set forth before the shareholders:

     1.  To elect four (4) directors of the Corporation to fill the vacancies
         created by the expiration of the terms of the Directors of Class II.

     2.  To transact any other business that may properly come before the
         meeting or any adjournment thereof.

                              ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

     Four Directors of Class II are to be elected at the Annual Meeting of
Shareholders to serve until the Annual Meeting in 2004 and until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified. Management proposes that
the four (4) nominees listed in this Proxy Statement as Directors of Class II be
elected.

     The nominees for whom the persons named as proxies intend to vote as
directors, unless otherwise indicated on the form of proxy, and certain

                 BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD


     The Board of Directors held 14 Board Meetings during the year 2000. These
meetings were either the Corporation Board Meetings and/or the Bank Board
Meetings. In addition to meeting as a group to review the Corporation's and the
Bank's business, certain members of the Board are appointed to serve on various
standing committees. Among those committees are the Audit and Compliance
Committee, Salary Committee and Directors' Nominating Committee. All incumbent
directors attended more than 75% of the aggregate of all meetings of the Board
of Directors and Committees on which they served.

     Audit and Compliance Committee. The Audit and Compliance Committee, which
currently consists of Messrs. Barker, Blair, and Leggett, reviews significant
audit, accounting, and compliance principles, policies and practices, meets with
the Corporation's and Bank's independent auditors to discuss the results of
their annual audit and reviews the performance of the internal auditing and
compliance functions. The Audit and Compliance Committee held four meetings in
2000.

     Salary  Committee.  The  Salary  Committee  currently  consists  of Messrs.
Barkhouser, Davenport, and Hudson. The Salary Committee approves compensation of
certain officers and makes  recommendations  to the Board of Directors for other
officers'  compensation and promotions,  directors' fees, and related  personnel
matters. The Salary Committee held two meetings in 2000.

     Directors' Nominating Committee. The Committee's function is to search for
potential qualified directors, to review the qualifications of potential
directors as suggested by directors, management, shareholders and others, and to
make recommendations to the entire Board for nominations of such individuals to
the shareholders. A shareholder may recommend nominees for director by complying
with any applicable provisions of the Corporation's bylaws and by writing to the
President of the Corporation and providing the proposed nominee's full name,
address, qualifications and other relevant biographical information. Members of
the present committee are Messrs. Barkhouser, Owen and Leggett. The Directors'
Nominating Committee held two meetings in 2000.

              REPORT OF SALARY COMMITTEE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     The Salary Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed of three
independent outside directors, is responsible for making recommendations to the
Board of Directors concerning compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and
for approving the compensation of the other executive officers. The Salary
Committee considers a variety of factors and criteria in arriving at its
decisions and recommendations for compensation of executive officers.

     In making its decisions and recommendations regarding compensation, the
Committee attempts to align the interests of the Bank's executive officers with
those of the shareholders. The Committee believes that increases in earnings per
share, dividends, and net equity improve shareholder market value and,
accordingly, compensation should be structured to enhance the profitability of
the Corporation and the total return to the shareholders.

     Executive officer compensation generally consists of salary, participation
in the Bank's profit sharing plan, and incentive compensation. The profit
sharing and incentive compensation plans are approved by the Board of Directors,
upon recommendation by the Salary Committee. A description of the profit sharing
plan is included in Note (2) under Executive Compensation. Executive officers
received incentive compensation in 2000 due to the attainment of certain
earnings by the Corporation. They may be eligible to receive incentive
compensation if certain earnings are attained in 2001. Certain key executive
officers are eligible to participate in the Executive Compensation Continuation
Plan described below under "Deferred Compensation Plan". All compensation is
paid by the Bank and no officer receives additional compensation from the
Corporation. In 1997, the Board of Directors and the shareholders approved the
stock option plan described below under Note (3) of "Executive Compensation".

     In considering executive officer compensation (other than the Chief
Executive Officer), the Committee receives and considers recommendations from
the Chief Executive Officer. The Committee conducts an annual evaluation of the
performance and effectiveness of the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief
Executive Officer's compensation then is recommended to the Board of Directors
by the Committee after consideration of the Bank's performance and the resulting
benefit to the shareholders.

                    REPORT OF AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE

     The primary function of the Audit and Compliance  Committee of the Board of
Directors is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by
reviewing the financial information,  which will be provided to the shareholders
and others, the systems of internal controls,  which management and the Board of
Directors have established,  and the audit and compliance process. The Committee
strives  to  provide  an open  avenue  of  communication  between  the  Board of
Directors,  management,  the internal auditors, the compliance officers, and the
independent accountants.

     Each of the three Directors who serve on the Audit and Compliance Committee
satisfy the  definition of independent  director under rules  established by the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. listing standards. The Board of
Directors  adopted a written charter for the Committee in June,  2000,  which is
attached to this proxy  statement as Exhibit A. The Committee held four meetings
in 2000.

     The  Audit  and  Compliance  Committee  has  reviewed  and  discussed  with
management the Corporation's audited consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended  December 31, 2000.  The Committee has discussed  with Arthur
Andersen LLP, the  Corporation's  independent  accountants  during calendar year
2000,  the matters  required to be discussed by Statement of Auditing  Standards
No. 61,  Communications  with Audit  Committees,  as  amended,  by the  Auditing
Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public  Accountants.  The
Committee received from Arthur Andersen LLP and reviewed the written disclosures
and the letter  required by  Independence  Standard No. 1 and has discussed with
Arthur Andersen LLP their  independence.  Arthur Andersen LLP performed services
for  auditing  the   Corporation's   2000  annual   report  and   reviewing  the
Corporation's  quarterly  reports  on Form  10-Q.  The fees  for  such  services
amounted  to $76,500 and the fees for other  services,  primarily  tax  related,
amounted to $13,300.

     Based on the  reviews  and  discussions  referred  to above,  the Audit and
Compliance   Committee   recommended   to  the  Board  of  Directors   that  the
Corporation's  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  be  included in the
Corporation's  Annual  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December 31, 2000
and be filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

(1)  Includes salary deferrals contributed by the employee to the 401(k) Plan
     and taxable compensation for term life insurance over $50,000.

(2)  Includes accrued payments of profit sharing (bonus) and incentive
     compensation participations. In 2000, the profit-sharing (bonus) plan
     provided that an amount equal to 6.50% of the Bank's net income (after
     taxes, but before deducting profit sharing and its related tax effect),
     less the Bank's 401(k) contributions, be paid to officers and employees who
     are in the Bank's employ on December 31, 2000. Incentive compensation
     represented payments to full-time officers based on the Corporation
     attaining certain earnings increase and officers meeting certain strategic
     goals. The total expense, paid or accrued, for the profit sharing (bonus)
     plan and incentive compensation payments for the year 2000 amounted to
     $723,912.

(3)  The Corporation grants options pursuant to the Corporation's Stock Option
     Plan approved by the shareholders at the 1997 annual meeting. Options
     granted prior to July 1, 1999 have been restated to reflect the impact of a
     2-for-1 stock split.

(4)  Includes matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan made by the Bank.
     Effective July 1, 1995, the Bank adopted a 401(k) Plan which covers
     substantially all full-time employees who are 21 years of age or older. An
     employee may defer a portion of his or her salary, not to exceed the lesser
     of 15% of compensation or $10,500. After one year of service, the Bank will
     make a matching contribution in the amount of 50% of the first 6% of
     compensation so deferred.

(a)  Value of unexercised in-the-money options is calculated by multiplying the
     number of unexercised options at December 31, 2000 by the difference in the
     closing price of the Corporation's common stock reported on December 31,
     2000 and the exercise price of the unexercised in-the-money options.

                                Option Repricing

     No action was taken in 2000 to lower the exercise price of an option held
by the Named Executive Officers.



                                Salary Committee

                      Interlocks and Insider Participation

     The Salary  Committee  of the Bank,  during  2000,  was composed of Messrs.
Barkhouser,  Davenport,  and  Hudson.  Mr.  Leggett  served  as a member  of the
committee from January 1 until April 25, 2000. None of the members of the Salary
Committee  were  officers or employees of the  Corporation  or its  subsidiaries
during 2000 or in prior years.

     None of the  executive  officers  of the  Corporation  or Bank  served as a
member of the Board of  Directors or as a member of the  Compensation  Committee
(or other Board  Committee  performing  equivalent  functions) of another entity
during  2000,  which  entity had an  executive  officer  serving on the Board of
Directors or as a member of the Salary Committee of the Corporation or the Bank.
Consequently, there are no interlocking relationships between the Corporation or
Bank and other entities that might affect the  determination of the compensation
of executive officers of the Corporation or Bank.

     As of December 31, 2000,  the Named  Executive  Officers have completed the
following years of credited service under the Bank's retirement plan:

     Charles H. Majors                       8
     E. Budge Kent, Jr.                     36
     T. Allen Liles                          3
     Carl T. Yeatts                         36

     Retirement Plan. The Bank's retirement plan is a non-contributory defined
benefit pension plan which covers salaried and regular hourly employees of the
Bank who are 21 years of age or older and who have had at least one year of
service. Advanced funding is accomplished by using the actuarial cost method
known as the collective aggregate cost method.

     As of December 31, 2000, the normal retirement benefit formula was 1.3% per
year of service times compensation plus .65% per year of service times
compensation in excess of social security covered compensation with years of
service limited to 35. At normal retirement, the monthly benefit is calculated
based on any consecutive five-year period which will produce the highest average
rate of basic monthly compensation. Basic monthly compensation includes salary
but excludes incentive and bonus compensation. Annual compensation at December
31, 2000 was also limited to $170,000 by Internal Revenue regulations. Cash
benefits under the plan generally commence on retirement at age 65, death, or
termination of employment. Partial vesting of the retirement benefits under the
plan occurs after three years of service and full vesting occurs after seven
years of service.

     Deferred Compensation Plan. The Board of Directors of the Bank adopted the
Executive Compensation Continuation Plan, a non-contributory deferred
compensation plan, in 1982. Under the plan, certain key executives who, in the
opinion of the Board of Directors, are making substantial contributions to the
overall growth and success of the Bank and who must be retained in order to
expand and continue satisfactory long term growth are eligible to receive
benefits afforded by the plan.

                                      I-10
<PAGE>
     Under agreements with eligible key executives pursuant to this plan, if any
such executive dies or retires while employed by the Bank, such executive or his
designated beneficiary will receive annual payments commencing at death or
retirement and continuing for 10 years. Retirement age under existing agreements
begins on or after age 62.

     As of December 31, 2000, the Named Executive Officers or their designated
beneficiaries are eligible to receive the following annual retirement benefits
for ten years after meeting the age requirement of 62:

                               Annual Benefit         Years to
     Name                    for 10 Years (in $)      Vesting
     ----                    -------------------      -------

     Carl T. Yeatts               25,000                 0

     Directors' Compensation. In 2000, non-officer directors, except Mr. Davis,
received a monthly retainer of $500 and attendance fees of $400 for each Board
meeting and Committee meeting attended. The aggregate total amount paid to
non-officer directors, excluding Mr. Davis, for the year 2000 was $146,800. Mr.
Davis was a Named Executive Officer in previous years but elected to become a
senior consultant and retire as an officer, effective December 31, 1997. Mr.
Davis can receive $5,500 per month through March, 2003 for services as a
consultant. No additional compensation is paid to Mr. Davis for service on the
Board of Directors or for attending Committee meetings. Non-officer directors
are excluded from the Bank's retirement plan and, therefore, do not qualify for
pension benefits.

                Indebtedness of and Transactions with Management

     Some of the directors and officers of the Corporation and the companies
with which they are associated were customers of, and had banking transactions
with, the Bank in the ordinary course of the Bank's business during 2000. All
loans and commitments to loan included in such transactions were made on
substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those
prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and, in
the opinion of the management of the Bank, do not involve more than a normal
risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features.

     During the year 2000, the highest aggregate amount of outstanding loans,
direct and indirect, to the directors and officers was $17,793,000 or 23% of
equity capital and this peak amount occurred on December 31, 2000.

             Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  requires
the  Corporation's  executive  officers and directors,  and persons who own more
than 10% of the Common  Stock,  to file  reports  of  ownership  and  changes in
ownership  on Forms 3, 4, and 5 with  the SEC and the  Nasdaq  National  Market.
Executive officers,  directors,  and owners of more than 10% of the Common Stock
are required by regulation to furnish the  Corporation  with copies of all Forms
3, 4, and 5 they file.

     Based solely on the Corporation's review of the copies of such forms it has
received and written representations from certain reporting persons who were not
required to file a Form 5 for 2000,  the  Corporation  believes  that all of its
directors  and  executive  officers  complied  with  all  Section  16(a)  filing
requirements applicable to them with respect to transactions during 2000. To the
Corporation's  knowledge,  there  were no owners of more than 10% of the  common
stock.

                         Independent Public Accountants

     The Board of Directors of the Corporation, pursuant to the recommendation
of its Audit and Compliance Committee, selected Arthur Andersen, LLP,
independent public accountants, to audit the financial statements of the
Corporation and the Bank for the year 2000. Arthur Andersen, LLP was first
engaged by the Bank in 1978 as its independent public accountant.

     A representative of Arthur Andersen, LLP will be present at the
shareholders' meeting and this representative will have an opportunity to make a
statement if he so desires. He will be available to respond to appropriate
questions.

                              Shareholder Proposals

     Under the  regulations  of the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  any
shareholder  desiring to make a proposal to be acted upon at next year's  annual
meeting of  shareholders  must present such proposal to the  Corporation  at its
principal  office in Danville,  Virginia,  not later than  November 26, 2001, in
order for such  proposal to be  considered  for  inclusion in the  Corporation's
proxy statement.

     In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be
properly brought before next year's Annual Meeting by a shareholder, even if the
proposal is not to be included in the Corporation's proxy statement, the
Corporation's bylaws provide that the shareholder must give notice in writing to
the Secretary of the Corporation not later than January 27, 2002. As to each
such matter, the notice must contain (i) a brief description of the business
desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting
such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name, record address of, and
class, series and number of shares beneficially owned by, the shareholder
proposing such business and (iii) any material interest of the shareholder in
such business.

                                 Other Business

     The Board of Directors knows of no other matters which may properly be
brought before the Annual Meeting. However, if any other matters should properly
come before the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the
enclosed form of proxy to vote such proxy in accordance with their best judgment
on such matters.



                                      By Order of the Board of Directors

                     AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE CHARTER

Purpose

The Audit and Compliance Committee (the "Committee") is a committee of the Board
of Directors. Its primary function is to assist the board in fulfilling its
oversight responsibilities by reviewing the financial information, which will be
provided to the shareholders and others, the systems of internal controls, which
Management and the Board of Directors have established, and the audit and
compliance process. In doing so, it is the responsibility of the Committee to
provide an open avenue of communication between the Board of Directors,
Management, the internal auditors, the compliance officers and the independent
accountants.

4.   At least one member of the Committee shall have a background in financial
     reporting, accounting or auditing, or other comparable experience or
     background which results in the individual's financial sophistication,
     including being or having been a Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial
     Officer, or other senior officer with financial oversight responsibilities
     (however, the lack of any such member shall not invalidate or otherwise
     affect the actions taken by the Committee).

5.   The Committee shall appoint one of the members of the Committee as
     Chairman. It is the responsibility of the Chairman to schedule and preside
     at all meetings of the Committee and to insure that the Committee has a
     written agenda for its meetings.

A.   General

1.   Have the power to conduct or authorize investigations into any matters
     within the Committee's scope of responsibilities. The Committee shall have

3.   Report Committee actions to the Board of Directors with recommendations,
     as the Committee may deem appropriate.

4.   Review and assess annually the Committee's formal charter and recommend to
     the Board of Directors any needed revisions thereto.

     auditors and Management in separate sessions to discuss any matters that
     the Committee believes should be discussed privately with the Committee.

<PAGE>
E.   Financial Reporting

1.   Insure that the independent accountants review the Company's quarterly
     financial statements prior to the filing of its Form 10Q.

2.   Advise Management, based upon its review and discussion, whether anything

     fact.

           Committee under generally accepted auditing standards.

F.   External Auditor

     selected, approve compensation of the independent accountants and review

1.   Review and monitor, as appropriate, with the independent accountants the
     administration of and compliance with, the Company's code of conduct and
     the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

While the Committee has the responsibilities and the powers set forth in this
Charter, it is not the duty of the Committee to plan or conduct audits or to
determine that the Company's financial statements are complete and accurate and
are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This is the
responsibility of Management and the independent accountants. Nor is it the duty
of the Committee to conduct investigations, to resolve disagreements, if any,
between Management and the independent accountants or to assure compliance with
laws and regulations and the Company's code of conduct.
