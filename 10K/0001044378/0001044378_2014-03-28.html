<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a cancer diagnostics company that develops and commercializes proprietary circulating tumor cell, or CTC, and circulating tumor DNA, or
ctDNA, tests utilizing a standard blood sample. These tests provide information to oncologists that enable them to select the most appropriate treatment for their patients based on better, timelier and more-detailed data on the characteristics of
tumors. Our current OncoCEE-BR breast cancer test and our planned tests utilize our Cell Enrichment and Extraction (CEE) technology for the enumeration and analysis of CTCs, and our CEE-Selector technology for the detection and analysis of ctDNA,
each performed on a standard blood sample. The CEE technology is an internally developed, microfluidics-based CTC capture and analysis platform, with enabling features that change how CTC testing can be used by clinicians by providing real-time
biomarker monitoring with a standard blood sample. The CEE-Selector technology enables mutation detection with enhanced sensitivity and specificity and is applicable to nucleic acid from CTCs or other sample types, such as blood plasma for ctDNA. We
believe CEE-Selector technology is an important part of certain of our pipeline CTC tests, and believe it could also be a stand-alone test for molecular analysis of biomarkers. </P>

 </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At our corporate headquarters facility located in San Diego, California, we operate a clinical laboratory
that is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, and accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, and manufacture our CEE microfluidic channels, related equipment and certain reagents to perform
our current breast cancer test and our planned future tests at this facility. CLIA certification and CAP accreditation are required before any clinical laboratory, including ours, may perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of obtaining
information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease, or the assessment of health. The OncoCEE-BR test and the tests we plan to offer are classified as laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, under CLIA regulations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">OncoCEE-BR is a breast cancer CTC test that is performed on a standard blood sample. It detects CTCs, which are typically very rare compared
to normal blood cells, and determines the patient&#146;s human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2, status by fluorescence <I>in situ </I>hybridization, or FISH. Pursuant to an agreement that we entered into with Clarient Diagnostic
Services, Inc., a GE Healthcare Company, as revised in May 2013, Clarient is making OncoCEE-BR available to physicians through its sales force. (Clarient does not have the exclusive marketing rights for the test.) </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that the OncoCEE-BR test offers advantages over other available CTC tests, with improved sensitivity and enumeration results as
well as diagnostic biomarker analyses. Competitive CTC tests rely on the expression of the epithelial cell adhesion molecule, or EpCAM, and cytokeratins for CTC capture, detection and enumeration. This approach may exclude CTCs that have undergone
intrinsic modifications of their phenotype, such as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, or EMT, thought to be critical for metastasis. EMT may represent a possible explanation for many patients who, despite an aggressive disease, are found to
be negative </P>

for the presence of CTCs by current technologies. In addition to cytokeratin positive epithelial CTCs, OncoCEE&#153; captures and detects EpCAM and cytokeratin negative CTCs, which are more
mesenchymal-like. Additionally, the OncoCEE platform enables evaluation of treatment-associated biomarkers, like HER2 status, which qualifies patients as candidates for HER2-targeted therapeutics such as Herceptin<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, Perjeta<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, Kadcyla<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (all Genentech/Roche) and Tykerb<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (GlaxoSmithKline). We plan to include immunocytochemical analysis of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor proteins, as well as mutation analysis as appropriate, into the OncoCEE-BR test
within the next year. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We anticipate launching OncoCEE-LU, a test performed on a standard blood sample for non-small cell lung cancer, or
NSCLC, in the third quarter of 2014. The biomarkers to be analyzed in the OncoCEE-LU test would include EML4/ALK and ROS1 gene fusions by FISH, and the epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, gene, the K-ras gene and the B-raf gene by mutation
analysis, in addition to CTC enumeration. Our OncoCEE-LU test would be run on a standard blood sample. We have entered into an agreement with Life Technologies Corporation, or Life Technologies, under which we are cooperating with Life Technologies
to develop, promote and commercialize our OncoCEE-LU test. Under this agreement, we would perform OncoCEE-LU tests in our laboratory and transmit the results to Life Technologies for their interpretation and reporting to healthcare professionals.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We plan to add other biomarker analyses to our OncoCEE tests as their relevance is demonstrated in clinical trials, for example, RET
proto-oncogene gene fusions in NSCLC, which may indicate a particular course of therapy. In addition, we are developing a series of other CTC and ctDNA tests for different solid tumor types, including colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, gastric
cancer and melanoma, each incorporating treatment-associated biomarker analyses specific to that cancer, planned to be launched over the next two to three years. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

abnormality, typically a genetic mutation or aberration, detected at either the gene, protein or metabolite level, may in fact be responsible for the transformation of the cell from a normal cell to a cancer cell. We have focused our efforts on
biomarkers associated with specific targeted cancer therapeutics, or resistance to those therapeutics. Examples include an amplified HER2 gene, which is associated with HER2-targeted therapeutics like Herceptin<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, Perjeta<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, Kadcyla<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and
Tykerb<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> for the treatment of breast cancer, or a mutated B-raf gene, which is associated with the drugs Zelboraf<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>
(Daiichi-Sankyo/Genentech/Roche) and Tafinlar<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (GlaxoSmithKline) for the treatment of melanoma. This is important because the presence or level of these biomarkers indicates to a physician
that the associated therapy is appropriate for the patient, or instead that the patient has, or has developed, resistance to that therapy. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Biomarkers have traditionally been detected in tumor tissue after biopsy or re-section, with the
analysis performed by a pathologist. We are able to perform these same analyses on CTCs or ctDNA on a standard blood sample using our CEE and CEE-Selector technology in our CLIA laboratory, meaning that the biomarkers detected in a patient&#146;s
tumor can now be monitored on a real-time basis without the need for a tissue biopsy. Because of the difficulty or inability to obtain periodic tissue biopsies, especially at the time of recurrence, this offers the physician a new source and level
of information than was previously available. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also have a research and development program focused on technology enhancements and
novel platform development and a translational research group evaluating clinical applications for cancer diagnostic tests in different cancer types and clinical settings. We have the capability to offer our current and planned unique cancer
diagnostic tests through our CLIA laboratory to physicians for patient care applications as well as to pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and academic centers using CTC or ctDNA testing, with biomarker analysis including genetic
analysis, in their clinical trials and research efforts. CTC tests, particularly those that offer analysis of CTCs for treatment-associated biomarkers, are becoming powerful tools in the practice of personalized medicine. They enable physicians to
utilize a standard blood sample as a &#147;liquid biopsy&#148; to assess the status of their patient&#146;s cancer at a cellular and molecular level on an ongoing basis, and to select therapies that have the highest likelihood of benefiting their
patients. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Historically, our average price received per OncoCEE-BR test performed for commercial customers has been approximately $694 and
$635 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively. This was heavily influenced by the fact that historically a high percentage of our sales were through our marketing partner, Clarient. We amended our arrangement with Clarient as of
May 2013, and we do not expect a significant percentage of our future sales to come through Clarient. Our future average price for commercial customers could increase from our historical figure, based on recognition of the medical value of our
products, publication of clinical utility study results, possible improvement of the product, introduction of additional tests, increased demand generated by our future sales and marketing efforts, and similar commercial factors. Factors that could
cause pricing for commercial customers to decrease include any perceived lack of clinical utility for CTC or ctDNA testing, or increased competition from other reference labs or IVD manufacturers. Third-party governmental and private payors have
reimbursement policies and fee schedules which determine the amounts, if any, we would receive for performing tests for their covered patients. Such governmental and private third-party payors frequently make determinations about how much (if
anything) they are willing to pay for tests such as ours, or for components of such tests; these determinations are important to our business and can have adverse or positive effects on the price we receive for our testing. For example, private
payors often look to Medicare policies and rates when setting their reimbursement rates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, our reimbursement rates can vary
based on whether we are considered by private third-party payors to be an &#147;in-network&#148; provider, a participating provider, a covered provider or an &#147;out-of-network&#148; provider. These definitions can vary from insurance company to
insurance company, but we are generally considered an &#147;out-of-network&#148; or non-participating provider by the vast majority of private third-party payors. It is not unusual for a company that offers highly specialized or unique testing to be
an &#147;out-of-network&#148; provider. An &#147;in-network&#148; provider usually has a contracted arrangement with the insurance company or benefits provider. This contract governs, among other things, service-level agreements and reimbursement
rates. In certain instances an insurance company may negotiate an &#147;in-network&#148; rate for our testing rather than pay the typical &#147;out-of-network&#148; rate. An &#147;in-network&#148; provider usually has rates that are lower per test
than those that are &#147;out-of-network&#148;, and that rate can vary from a single digit percentage deduction discount to upwards of 25% to 30% lower than an &#147;out-of-network&#148; provider. The discount rate varies based on the insurance
company, the testing type and often times the specifics of the patient&#146;s insurance plan. In some plans, there is no benefit paid for out-of-network claims and our ability to collect from the patient may be hindered by the financial resources of
the patient or by state laws that prohibit billing of patients for denied out-of-network claims. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We cannot predict whether, or under what
circumstances, payors will reimburse for all components of our tests. Payment amounts can also vary across individual policies. Full or partial denial of coverage by payors, or </P>

reimbursement at inadequate levels, would have a material adverse impact on our business and on market acceptance of our tests. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, we have engaged in only limited sales and marketing activities. Such activities have primarily related to our OncoCEE-BR test and
have been conducted pursuant to an agreement with Clarient. This agreement was revised in May 2013 and Clarient no longer has exclusive marketing rights to this test. We expect that in the future the percentage of our revenue which is generated
through our arrangement with Clarient will diminish. We also have established a non-exclusive agreement with Life Technologies for the commercialization of OncoCEE-LU tests when the development and validation of the OncoCEE-LU test are completed.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Using a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering, we plan to build an internal sales and marketing team to market and
sell OncoCEE-BR and our planned future cancer diagnostic tests directly to oncologists. This team will also provide technical expertise and support for the sales representatives of our sales and marketing partners. Our plans call for starting with
an initial group of 7 sales representatives, and, based on success and test volume, growing this number to 15-20 within two years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
collaborate with physicians and researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center and plan to expand our collaborative relationships to include other key thought leaders at other institutions for the cancer types we target with OncoCEE-BR and our planned
future CTC and ctDNA tests. Such relationships help us develop and validate the effectiveness and utility of OncoCEE-BR and our planned future tests in specific clinical settings and provide us access to patient samples and data. We completed a
study, recently published in <I>Cancer Medicine</I>, utilizing our OncoCEE-BR test, and a version of this test adapted for use with bone marrow samples, with a group at MD Anderson Cancer Center comprised of breast cancer surgeons, pathologists and
basic researchers. In this study, we demonstrated the ability to identify HER2 positive CTCs and disseminated tumor cells, or DTCs, seen in bone marrow in patients that had been previously classified as HER2 negative by analysis of their tumor
tissue. A HER2 positive result in a patient with breast cancer provides an indication to the oncologist that there is likely to be a survival benefit from treatment with Herceptin<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, which has
been demonstrated in a number of large clinical studies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are currently involved in a new clinical study following up on this finding
in CTCs, employing OncoCEE-BR tests for patient selection and monitoring. This study, led by investigators at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, is currently enrolling patients, and is likely to produce initial results within a year. We believe that
these results will provide clinical utility data to support the wide use of OncoCEE-BR tests as a routine diagnostic test for breast cancer patients. In the screening phase of this study, we are testing in our CLIA-certified laboratory blood samples

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We plan to grow our business by directly offering oncologists CTC and ctDNA tests. Based on our product development data, as well as
discussions with our collaborators, we believe that our planned tests should provide important information and clinical value to oncologists. In particular, our planned CTC and ctDNA tests should deliver important, actionable information not
provided by other tests. For example, the market leading clinical CTC test is the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved CellSearch<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> test (Janssen Diagnostics), which
provides CTC enumeration, but lacks the ability to perform biomarker analysis. We believe our ability to rapidly translate research insights about the utility of cytogenetic, immunocytochemical and molecular biomarkers to provide information to
oncologists for treatment decisions in the clinical setting will improve patient treatment and management, and that these tests will become a key component in the standard of care for personalized cancer treatment. </P>

treatment or are being monitored. For example, in breast cancer, many women have been deemed cancer-free, but continue to undergo periodic monitoring to assure there has been no disease
recurrence. Our OncoCEE-BR test and our planned OncoCEE-LU test only require a readily accessible standard blood sample and thus may be used to help manage these patients, including supporting the selection of appropriate treatment, at multiple time
points during the course of their disease. Because our tests require only a standard blood sample, they can be particularly useful when no, old or inadequate amounts of biopsy or surgical material is available, as is often the case in lung cancer,
even at the time of initial evaluation. For example, up to 25% of patients with lung cancer are not surgically treated for various reasons, including patient status (consensus statement from the American College of Chest Physicians and the Society
of Thoracic Surgeons; <I>Chest</I>, Dec. 2012). This is also the case with breast and lung cancers once surgical resection of the tumor has taken place and treatment has been initiated. Patients with breast and lung cancer must often undergo
surgical resection of their primary tumor as part of their treatment. Therefore, at the time of progression or recurrence there may be no ability to obtain a tissue biopsy. Additionally, many studies have shown that most tumors mutate during
treatment and as the disease progresses, so information from the initial tumor tissue may not be relevant. Again, a significant benefit of our technology is that it allows physicians to assess the current status of the tumors on a real-time basis
utilizing a standard blood sample. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We currently offer and conduct our breast cancer diagnostic tests and offer our clinical trial

environmental and hereditary risk factors. Many different tissue types can become malignant, such as breast, lung, liver, and skin, and even within a particular tumor there is heterogeneity, with certain cancer cells in a patient bearing specific
cellular or genetic biomarkers which others lack. It has only been in recent years that technology has progressed far enough to enable researchers to understand many cancers at a cellular and molecular level, attribute specific cancers to associated
genetic changes and determine the extent to which these changes are seen in a patient&#146;s tumor. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cancer cells contain genetic
alterations compared to normal human cells. Common genetic abnormalities correlated to cancer include gains or losses of genetic material on specific chromosomal regions, or loci, or changes in specific genes, or mutations, which ultimately result
in detrimental cellular changes followed by cancerous or pre-cancerous conditions. For example, multiple gains or losses of or on various chromosomes, and the rearrangement of genetic material among chromosomes, or chromosomal translocations, have
been observed in different cancer types, such as HER2 in breast cancer and EML4/ALK in NSCLC. In addition, mutations </P>

within gene sequences, or single nucleotide variations, can give rise to aberrant proteins that do not perform their functions correctly, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Such genetic
alterations can be a result of multiple factors, including genetic predisposition, environmental or lifestyle factors or viral infections. Importantly, these genetic changes can be used as biomarkers to help guide appropriate treatment. Detecting
these biomarkers, particularly those representing drug targets, or those indicative of responsiveness or resistance of a tumor&#146;s cells to specific therapies, helps clinicians to select drugs, design treatment regimens and optimize patient care
and management. Tests that provide such predictive information have the potential to dramatically improve treatment outcomes for patients suffering from cancer. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cancer is difficult to diagnose and manage due to its heterogeneity at morphologic, genetic and clinical levels. Traditional methods of
diagnosis for solid tumors, routinely used as the initial step in cancer detection, involve a tissue biopsy followed by a pathologist examining a thin slice of potentially cancerous tissue under a microscope. A recently obtained tissue sample is
used in combination with chemical staining techniques to enable analysis of the biopsy. After staining, the pathologist determines through visual inspection whether the biopsy contains normal or cancerous cells, with those that are deemed cancerous
being graded on a level of aggressiveness. Often an analysis of biomarkers relevant to that tumor type is also performed on the tissue, ranging from immunohistochemistry to FISH, to mutation analysis by various means such as microarrays and
sequencing. After the diagnosis, a clinical workup is performed according to established guidelines for the specific cancer type. From there, the physician determines the stage of progression of the cancer based on a series of clinical measures,
such as size, grade, metastasis rates, symptoms and patient history, and decides on a treatment plan that may include surgery, watchful waiting, radiation, chemotherapy, or stem cell transplant. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This type of analysis is dependent on the availability of a recently obtained tissue biopsy for the pathologist to analyze. Such a biopsy is
often not available. A tumor may not be readily accessible for biopsy, a patient&#146;s condition may be such that a biopsy is not advised, and for routine periodic patient monitoring to evaluate potential progression or recurrence, a biopsy is a
fairly invasive procedure and not typically performed. As the length of time between when the original biopsy, diagnosis or surgery is conducted to the current evaluation of the patient increases, the likelihood that an original biopsy specimen is
truly representative of the current disease condition declines, as does the usefulness of the original biopsy for making treatment decisions. This risk intensifies in situations where a drug therapy is being administered, because the drug can put
selective pressure on the tumor cells to adapt and change. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similarly, the heterogeneity referred to above means that different parts or
areas of the same tumor can have different molecular features or properties. In evaluating a biopsy specimen, the pathologist will take a few thin slices of the tumor for microscopic review rather than exhaustively analyzing the whole tumor mass.
The pathologist can only report on the tumor sections analyzed and if other parts of the tumor have different features, such as biomarkers corresponding to specific treatments, they can be missed. A more representative analysis of the entire tumor,
as well as any metastases if they are present, is very helpful. Moreover, there are complications and morbidity associated with the invasive lung cancer biopsy procedures. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Circulating tumor cells, or CTCs, are cancer cells that have detached from the tumor matrix and invaded the patient&#146;s blood or other
bodily fluids. These cells are representative of the tumor and its metastases, and can function as their surrogates. Testing CTCs can complement pathologic information drawn from a biopsy or resected tissue sample, helping to insure that the
analysis is comprehensive and not biased by tumor heterogeneity and sampling issues. They can also provide critical data when a biopsy is not possible. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the presence and number of CTCs provides information on
the likely course of certain types of disease for the cancer patient, or in other words they are considered &#147;prognostic.&#148; Since CTCs are representative of the tumor, they can also be used for biomarker analysis, such as helping to guide
therapy </P>

selection. Such analyses are &#147;predictive&#148; in that they offer insight into the likely responsiveness or resistance to particular therapies. After surgery and during any subsequent
therapy or monitoring period, blood samples can periodically be drawn in a standard manner and analyzed to evaluate a therapy&#146;s continuing effectiveness, as well as to detect other biomarkers such as new genetic mutations that may arise as a
result of selection pressure by a particular therapy or by chance. Physicians can use this information to determine which therapy is most likely to benefit their patients at particular times through the course of their disease. Treatment decisions
based on patient-specific information are the foundation of personalized medicine, and tests, or assays, that guide a physician in the selection of individualized therapy for a patient are termed &#147;predictive assays.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ctDNA is nucleic acid that is released into blood by dying tumor cells. Cell death occurs in all tissues, especially those that are rapidly
dividing, and in cancer, where cell growth is not only rapid but also uncontrolled. Parts of tumors often outgrow their blood supply, resulting in cell death. Tumor cells dying as a result of therapy also release nucleic acid into blood. As a
consequence, ctDNA is common in cancer patients and scientists believe that like CTCs, it may be more representative of a patient&#146;s tumor than a few thin sections from a tissue biopsy, thus reducing the heterogeneity problem. ctDNA is found in
the plasma component of blood and is readily accessible in a standard blood sample. Analyzing ctDNA for mutations that are used as biomarkers for therapy selection shows great promise. One of the strengths of this approach, in addition to not
requiring a tissue biopsy, is that it is not dependent on capturing rare tumor cells from blood to provide a sample for testing. The difficulty with this approach is that the cellular context is lost since the ctDNA is mixed with a much larger
amount of circulating DNA from normal cells that are continuously dying and being replaced in the body, thus making analysis challenging. This requires a mutation detection methodology with enhanced sensitivity and specificity, to distinguish
mutations in particular gene regions in cancer cells from the normal gene sequence present in those same genes in normal cells which co-exist in blood as normal cells die and are replaced in the body. Our CEE-Selector technology provides this
necessary sensitivity and specificity and creates an opportunity for ctDNA analysis to complement CTC analysis, or potentially to serve as the platform for stand-alone tests. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Given the incidence of cancer in the United States, with an estimated 800,000 new cases in 2013 for the major solid tumors targeted by our
planned test products, the markets for our current and planned cancer diagnostic tests are very large. Furthermore, these market opportunities are even greater due to the benefits of CTC and ctDNA testing, including not only the ability to offer
physicians a simple way to augment an initial tumor biopsy analysis but also to provide a means for relatively frequent monitoring of the tumor&#146;s molecular status, utilizing a standard blood sample as a &#147;liquid biopsy.&#148; The latter
application enables the oncologist to determine if or how a tumor is changing over time or is responding to therapy and what the next treatment should be. For example, in the United States, the incidence of new cases of breast cancer alone is
estimated to be over 230,000&nbsp;in 2013, and the prevalence of this disease is over 2.8&nbsp;million (the number of women with a history of breast cancer in the United States, including women being treated and women who have finished treatment),
with an estimated 330,000 lumpectomies performed annually in the United States. Of these lumpectomies, 20% need to be repeated because on pathological examination it is shown the procedure did not result in &#147;clean margins,&#148; thus suggesting
not all the tumor was removed, according to a Johns Hopkins report. If a CTC test were performed at the time of initial diagnosis, at the time of surgery, or in lieu of, or as an adjunct to, a PET/CT scan (as a CTC test has the potential to identify
a single tumor cell in a blood sample, while a scan requires a tumor mass of millions of cells to be detectable), to monitor disease progression or test for recurrence, thousands of tests, in breast cancer alone, could be performed per year with
still relatively low market penetration. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Use of CTC- and ctDNA-Derived Biomarker Data in Cancer Treatment </I></B></P>

to or in place of the tumor, especially when a recent tumor biopsy is not available. In theory, almost any analysis that can be performed on tumor tissue can also be performed on CTCs, while ctDNA, because it is only nucleic acid, is more limited.

<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Tests and Services </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have launched
our first product, OncoCEE-BR for breast cancer, and plan to continue to launch a series of tests for CTCs in different tumor types, including NSCLC, gastric, colorectal and prostate cancers and melanoma, incorporating analyses for different
biomarkers, over the next 3 years. OncoCEE-BR is and the planned tests will be based on the CEE technology platform. The CEE system isolates CTCs from blood samples of cancer patients for enumeration (or count) and genetic analysis. A sample is
shipped to us in our specialized blood collection tube, called the CEE-Sure tube, for recovery and analysis of CTCs. When performing the CTC assay, the sample is processed in our laboratory. The specimen of blood is separated into its parts (red
blood cells, buffy coat and plasma). The buffy coat is incubated with the antibody solution and passed through a proprietary microfluidic channel containing 9,000 microscopic posts coated with reagents to capture antibody-labeled tumor cells. The
captured cells are suitable for further testing of whole cells directly in the microfluidic channel or by releasing the cells from the microfluidic channel and performing CEE-Selector or similar techniques. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinicians acknowledge limitations of currently available CTC test systems such as
CellSearch<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> that rely on capture solely by anti-EpCAM antibodies and detection by anti-cytokeratin antibodies. Capture and detection based only on these two antigens is unlikely to identify
all CTCs, and clinically this may result in no CTCs being detected in cases in which they are present. For example, some tumor cells that have been released into the circulatory system have undergone an EMT. These mesenchymal cells are less
differentiated than epithelial cells and more similar to stem cells. OncoCEE-BR enables, and we believe our planned assays will enable, the capture of significantly more CTCs than is accomplished through the use of traditional anti-EpCAM
immuno-capture alone. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to enhanced capture, our technology also improves the detection of CTCs. As with EpCAM, tumor cells
that have undergone EMT can down-regulate the synthesis of cytokeratin, leading to an underestimate or even an apparent absence of CTCs since their positive identification has traditionally relied on anti-cytokeratin staining. We have developed
alternative methods of fluorescent cell staining that are uniquely possible within the CEE system to enhance or enable detection of CTCs with low or no cytokeratin signal. This technology is called CEE-Enhanced. We believe that the combination of
specific cocktails of tumor-associated capture antibodies and more sensitive fluorescent detection of CTCs through CEE-Enhanced methodology will lead to major advances in the capture, enumeration and analysis of CTCs. CEE-Enhanced methodology is
expected to be included in our commercially available tests by mid-2014. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Analysis of CTCs performed by us incorporates both standard and proprietary methods.
Immunocytochemistry which looks at proteins, analogous to the immunohistochemistry performed on tissues, can be readily applied and performed in the microfluidic channel, dependent only on suitable biomarkers. Similarly, FISH, used to evaluate
cytogenetic abnormalities in cells, may be performed in our microfluidic channel using validated assays available from a number of vendors. For genetic mutation analysis, standard technologies can be applied. We have also developed proprietary
CEE-Selector technology for mutation analysis in CTCs and ctDNA, with enhanced sensitivity and specificity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">CTCs are generally very rare
and outnumbered many-fold by white blood cells. This complexity has been a challenge for standard technologies. We believe our CEE-Selector technology will offer enhanced specificity and sensitivity (greater than 1-in-10,000 of mutated sequence to
normal sequence in a complex genetic background) compared to other approaches, and that it will potentially have broader application than just CTC analysis, including analysis of ctDNA in plasma, both in a CLIA-certified laboratory setting and as an
IVD. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">OncoCEE-BR is, and our planned tests would be, Laboratory Developed Tests. FDA clearance or approval is not currently required to
offer these types of tests in our laboratory once they have been clinically and analytically validated. We seek licenses and approvals for our laboratory facility and for LDTs from the appropriate regulatory authorities, such as the Centers for
Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, which oversees CLIA, and various state regulatory bodies. Certain states, such as New York, require us to obtain state licensure in order for us to perform testing on specimens taken from patients or received
from ordering physicians from those states. As part of this process, the State of New York requires validation of our tests. We are currently in the process of addressing the requirements for licensure in Florida and New York, and have re-obtained
all required licenses and approvals from all other states requiring licensure of out-of-state laboratories. We were required to re-license in certain states as a result of our July 2013 reincorporation to Delaware. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following outline indicates our current (OncoCEE-BR) and planned tests and indicates the stage the product is in and the targeted date of
commercialization. As discussed in &#147;Description of the Business&#151;Test Development Process&#148; below, prospective assays initially begin in research (stage 1) and progress through to development (stage 2), validation (stage 3) and finally
availability for commercialization (stage 4). The OncoCEE-BR test has completed all stages as to CTC and HER2 test capabilities. Our remaining identified proposed tests have completed the research stage and are at the stages shown in the table below
with their respective estimated timetables for completing stage 4. As with all scientific endeavors, such timetables are only estimates; unanticipated problems might result in delays. We consider these timetables to be fairly aggressive, given the
likelihood of our experiencing such unanticipated problems and associated delays. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the development stage, there is still work to be
done to finalize sensitivity and specificity of the assay. This work will vary as the assay is tested and fine-tuned in order to prepare it for validation and eventual commercial offering. In the validation stage, the assay has been fully developed
and we are now able to run (or are in the process of running) a specific number of samples, both positive and negative, in order to validate that the assay results are reproducible. A validated assay is considered to have completed the availability
for commercialization stage when the necessary training has been given and any necessary governmental licenses and approvals have been obtained so that we can start selling the assay through our commercial sales channel and provide patient results.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our proposed tests have certain commonalities. For example, in each proposed test, biomarkers will be examined by one or both of FISH or
CEE-Selector. Given the development, validation and commercialization of our first CTC/FISH test (OncoCEE-BR), all subsequent FISH- and Immunofluorescence-based assays have effectively been developed for the planned biomarker. Progression of these
planned assays through stage 3 is largely dependent on the timing of our obtaining suitable validation specimens, although various scientific and other factors can also affect the pace of a particular proposed test&#146;s progress through the
validation stage. Thus, the OncoCEE-LU (i.e., CTC/FISH-based OncoCEE-LU), OncoCEE-GA and OncoCEE-DTC tests are targeted to be commercial in 2014. CTC-based OncoCEE-CR and OncoCEE-PR tests are targeted to be commercial in 2015 given our estimate of
the timing to acquire appropriate positive and negative validation samples. </P>
 <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">15 </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For ctDNA based assays, CEE-Selector will be used to detect each relevant mutation, and our
current estimate is that development will be completed in 2014. Biomarker mutations (such as B-raf and K-ras) are often commonly seen in different tumor types, thus, once a particular mutation assay is developed for CEE-Selector, it can be applied
to any tumor type. The OncoCEE-LU ctDNA test is anticipated to be our first CEE-Selector test to undergo validation. Given the nature of a molecular based test such as CEE-Selector, specimens can be batched and tested simultaneously, thereby
reducing the validation time. We are targeting the OncoCEE-LU ctDNA test to be commercial by the end of 2014. All remaining currently proposed ctDNA tests would then follow and are currently targeted to be commercial in 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We currently intend to use approximately $5 million of the net proceeds of our initial public offering to fund further research and
development and related activities. This includes all of the expenditures which we believe are needed to complete all four stages of development for the planned tests described below. Primarily these expenditures will be for existing and additional
scientific personnel in the time periods reflected in the table below, and secondarily for obtaining a sufficient number of suitable validation specimens. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our OncoCEE-BR breast cancer test is the first CTC test we developed and we are currently offering it to physicians through our CLIA
laboratory. It is based on a standard blood sample and can be used at the time of diagnosis and for monitoring, including at the time of progression or recurrence. This allows the physician to characterize the tumor to help define treatment options,
either augmenting tissue analysis or replacing it when a tumor biopsy is not available. The test currently includes CTC enumeration and determination of HER2 status by FISH on the captured CTCs, and then more broadly to any cell captured on our CEE
microfluidic channels that is not a white blood cell. HER2 status is used by oncologists to determine suitability of a patient for treatment with HER2-targeted therapeutics, which include
Herceptin<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, as well as Kadcyla<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and Perjeta<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, monoclonal antibodies directed
to HER2, and Tykerb<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, a kinase inhibitor with activity against HER2. We plan to add immunocytochemistry analysis of CTCs for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor to our OncoCEE-BR test,
which will provide information on suitability of breast cancer patients for endocrine or hormonal therapies such as selective estrogen receptor modulators, including tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors that block the synthesis of estrogen, including
Femara<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (Novartis) and Arimidex<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (AstraZeneca) or other therapeutics that block estrogen production, including Zoladex<SUP

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are now following a similar development path for additional OncoCEE CTC tests for cancer types other than breast cancer, with a focus on
large population solid tumor types, or cancers for which there are approved therapies that rely on biomarker tests we have previously developed. Examples of these tests include OncoCEE-LU for lung cancer, OncoCEE-GA for gastric cancer, OncoCEE-CR<SUP

cancer patients, especially those diagnosed at Stage IIIB or Stage IV, are not treated surgically for various reasons, including tumor accessibility and status of the patient. In these cases, CTC and ctDNA tests are alternatives for obtaining more
detailed information about the molecular status of the tumor that helps the physician select appropriate therapy. This is even more important as the number of targeted therapies for lung cancer with associated biomarkers increases. Our OncoCEE-LU
test would include several components: CTC enumeration, FISH analysis for EML4/ALK and ROS1, and potentially for ret proto-oncogene, all linked to the drug Xalkori<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (Pfizer), mutation analysis
for the EGFR gene, the K-ras gene and the B-raf gene. The L858R mutation of the EGFR gene and Exon 19 deletions are activators of EGFR kinase activity and are linked to the drugs Tarceva<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>
(Astellas/Genentech/Roche) and Iressa<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (AstraZeneca). The T790M mutation of the EGFR gene is a resistance marker for EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is linked to drugs in development that
address this resistance, such as Gilotrif<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (Boehringer-Ingelheim) and dacomitinib (Pfizer). The codon 12 and 13 mutations of the K-ras gene are linked to non-responsiveness to the EGFR kinase
inhibitors such as Tarceva<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and Iressa<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, and the codon 600 mutations of the B-raf gene are linked to Zelboraf<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and Tafinlar<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, which are both approved for melanoma and are in clinical trials for lung cancer. Our OncoCEE-LU test would be performed on
a standard blood sample. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In parallel, we plan to offer ctDNA tests for mutation analysis of, for example, EGFR, K-ras and B-raf genes, to
provide information in situations where CTCs are not identified. In our development of this technology platform we have generated data showing detection of the T790M mutation in ctDNA from the blood plasma of lung cancer patients progressing on
tyrosine kinase inhibitors in which no CTCs were detected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>OncoCEE-GA </I></B></P>

practice relies on a biopsy for tumor tissue analysis to detect elevated HER2, in the same manner as is done for breast cancer. Our test would circumvent this need for tissue, as well as providing straightforward monitoring of HER2 status from a
standard blood sample, on a real-time basis during treatment. Our OncoCEE-GA test would include CTC enumeration and HER2 analysis of CTCs by FISH. </P>

our OncoCEE-CR test for colorectal cancer is to offer mutation testing analogous to that performed on lung cancer CTCs, namely detection of key mutations in the EGFR, K-ras and B-raf genes, along with CTC enumeration. Testing of the EGFR gene would
focus on the L858R mutation and Exon 19 deletions as activators of EGFR kinase activity, and the T790M mutation as a resistance marker for certain EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Testing on the K-ras gene would focus on codons 12 and 13 mutations.
Testing on the B-raf gene would focus on V600 mutations. Our OncoCEE-CR test would be run against a standard blood sample. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This testing

test for prostate cancer would be based on the analysis of CTCs found in a standard blood sample by FISH for key biomarkers: the androgen receptor, and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). The test would also include CTC enumeration, and our
CEE-Cap antibody capture cocktail would be modified from that used for breast and lung cancer to include prostate specific membrane antigen. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The androgen receptor normally binds the hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, and is the target for several drug molecules,

Tests for other mutations will be added as they are developed. These tests would be similar to those performed on CTCs but would instead focus on ctDNA in plasma. These tests would lack the cellular context provided by CTCs but would not require CTC
isolation and would be simpler to perform. In addition, one of the benefits of this technology is its ability to detect and identify mutations in blood plasma from cancer patients in whom we were not able to isolate CTCs. This indicates the
importance of the enhanced sensitivity of the CEE-Selector technology and the ability of ctDNA tests to complement CTC tests. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Laboratory Testing

protein biomarkers, and FISH analysis, is a way to drive efficiencies, reduce costs, speed up turnaround time, and generate more reliable, uniform, and in some cases more sensitive data. We have identified an automation solution for the visual
analysis, which needs to be optimized and then transferred to and validated in our CLIA laboratory. We have also adapted a semi-automated system for the separation, processing and washing steps before running a sample on the microfluidic channel,
which is now being used in the research laboratory and similarly needs to be transferred and validated in the CLIA laboratory. These measures will reduce costs and time as well as allow for higher-throughput as sample volumes increase.

and HER2 FISH performed on CTCs and compared with HER2 analysis performed on tumor tissue from the same patients, involved over 120 patient samples. The results of our validation studies, and the demonstration of a reliable and reproducible method
for CTC capture and analysis using the OncoCEE platform were published in a paper entitled &#147;Novel Platform for the Detection of Cytokeratin Positive (CK+) and Cytokeratin Negative (CK+) CTCs&#148; appearing in the December 2011 issue of

patients in the other cancer types (<I>Cancer Discovery</I>, December 2011). Moreover, the results clearly demonstrated that our use of the CEE-Cap capture antibody cocktail enabled recovery of more CTCs as compared to using only anti-EpCAM
antibodies. This data served as a clinical validation study for CTC enumeration. When CEE-Enhanced staining is applied to detect cytokeratin-negative CTCs, we expect to see far more CTCs based on preliminary studies reported in a paper entitled

actionable information related to therapy selection. We have performed a number of clinical research studies in collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center investigators involving various tumor types, including breast, ovarian, endometrial, lung,
colorectal, bladder and prostate cancers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In a collaboration with physicians and researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center, we evaluated
matched samples of tumor tissue, blood for CTCs and bone marrow for DTCs in early stage breast cancer patients for evidence of HER2 amplification, which would indicate eligibility for HER2-targeted therapies like Herceptin<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, a potentially life-saving treatment. These results were also presented at both the 2011 and 2012 annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. In a study published in <I>Cancer
Medicine</I> (2013, 2(2) 226-233) and involving 96 patients, HER2 positive CTCs and/or DTCs were identified in 18.8% of cases in which the primary tumor was HER2 negative. In the same cohort of patients, only 12.5% were HER2 positive in their
primary tumor. In other words, beyond the 12 (of the 96) which traditional tumor tissue analysis had indicated could benefit from Herceptin-based therapy, the OncoCEE-BR test detected 18 (of the 96) patients who (despite the fact they were
identified as being HER2 negative by primary-tumor testing) could benefit from Herceptin-based therapy. Patients classified as HER2 negative based on tumor tissue and found to have HER2 positive CTCs and/or DTCs will continue to be followed by our
collaborators at MD Anderson Cancer Center to assess their overall and progression-free survival. Tumor heterogeneity is one likely cause of the discordance for HER2 status between tumor tissue and our test performed on blood and bone marrow
samples. Tumor heterogeneity indicates an important clinical application for the OncoCEE-BR test, confirmation and crosschecking of the tissue analysis performed by the pathologist at the time of biopsy or surgery, especially if HER2 negative, with
a CTC analysis derived from a standard blood sample. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinical utility studies, which demonstrate the specific clinical setting in which a

principal competition comes from mainstream diagnostic methods, used by pathologists and oncologists for many years, which focus on tumor tissue analysis. It may be difficult to change the methods or behavior of oncologists to incorporate our CTC
and ctDNA testing, including molecular diagnostic testing, into their practices in conjunction with or instead of tissue biopsies and analysis. In addition, companies offering capital equipment and kits or reagents to local pathology laboratories
represent another source of potential competition. These kits are used directly by the pathologist, which can facilitate adoption. We plan to focus our marketing and sales efforts on medical oncologists rather than on pathologists. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also face competition from companies that offer products or are conducting research to develop products for CTC or ctDNA testing in various
cancers. In particular, Janssen Diagnostics, LLC markets its CellSearch<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> test and Atossa Genetics markets its ArgusCYTE<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> test, which
are competitive to our OncoCEE-BR test for CTC enumeration, and HER2 analysis, respectively. However, the ArgusCYTE<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> test measures HER2 mRNA, which is not typically used for HER2 analysis,
while we employ FISH for this analysis. FISH is generally considered to be the gold standard. CTC and ctDNA testing is a new area of science and we cannot predict what tests others will develop that may compete with or provide results similar or
superior to the results we are able to achieve with the tests we develop. In addition to Janssen Diagnostics and Atossa Genetics, our competitors include public companies such as Alere (Adnagen) and Illumina as well as many private companies,
including Apocell, EPIC Sciences, Clearbridge Biomedics, Cynvenio Biosystems, Fluxion Biosciences, RareCells, ScreenCell and Silicon Biosystems. Many of these groups, in addition to operating research and development laboratories, are establishing
CLIA-certified testing laboratories while others are focused on selling equipment and reagents. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that pharmaceutical and
biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus attention and resources on the personalized cancer diagnostic sector as the potential and prevalence increases of molecularly targeted oncology therapies approved by the FDA along with companion
diagnostics. For example, the FDA has recently approved three such agents&#151;Xalkori<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> from Pfizer Inc. along with its companion anaplastic lymphoma kinase FISH test from Abbott Laboratories,
Inc., Zelboraf<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> from Daiichi-Sankyo/Genentech/Roche along with its companion B-raf kinase V600 mutation test from Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. and Tafinlar<SUP

Biodesix, Caris, Clarient, Foundation Medicine, Response Genetics, Neogenomics, Agendia, Genomic Health, and Genoptix, and which, while not currently offering CTC or ctDNA tests which are truly competitive with ours, are selling to the medical
oncologists and pathologists. Large laboratory services companies, such as Sonic USA, Quest and LabCorp, provide more generalized cancer diagnostic testing. </P>

internationally. As more information regarding cancer genomics becomes available to the public, we anticipate that more products aimed at identifying targeted treatment options will be developed and that these products may compete with ours. In
addition, competitors may develop their own versions of our current and planned tests in countries where we did not apply for patents or where our patents have not issued and compete with us in those countries, including encouraging the use of their

able to be obtained easily or may require substantial design or manufacturing modifications. Any significant problem experienced by one of our sole source suppliers (particularly K.R. Anderson, Inc., which supplies a custom-packaged silicone
compound used in our manufacturing) may result in a delay or interruption in the supply of components to us until that supplier cures the problem or an alternative source of the component is located and qualified. Any delay or interruption would
likely lead to a delay or interruption in our manufacturing operations. The inclusion of substitute components must meet our product specifications and could require us to qualify the new supplier with the appropriate government regulatory

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our patent portfolio consists of 3 issued U.S. patents, 6 pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding foreign patents and foreign
patent applications. These patents and patent applications are related to various aspects of our current and planned CTC and ctDNA tests, including our CEE microfluidic channels, our CEE-Sure blood collection tubes, CEE-Cap antibody capture
cocktail, CEE-Enhanced staining methodology, and CEE-Selector technology for mutation detection. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>CEE Microfluidic Channels</I>. We
have three issued U.S. patents related to our current business (U.S. Patent Nos. 7,439,062, 7,695,956 and 8,158,410), and a number of additional U.S. and foreign patent applications, which cover our microfluidic channel technology. Our microfluidic
channels are differentiated from other microfluidic channels used for CTC capture based on their unique geometry, particularly the arrangement of posts within the flow channel. The posts are chemically derivatized to enable capture of
antibody-tagged CTCs, and are positioned to disrupt streamline or laminar flow of cells through the microfluidic channel to assure they come in contact with the posts for capture. Because the capture area of the microfluidic channel is sealed on one
side with a glass cover slip, immunocytochemical and cytogenetic staining and analysis can occur within the microfluidic channel. </P>

with more research required. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>CEE-Cap Antibody Capture Cocktail</I>. We have two pending U.S. patent applications (12/730,738 and
13/269,532) as well as their corresponding foreign patent applications directed to our antibody capture cocktail technology, which includes using antibodies to a number of tumor-associated antigens from cancer cells of both epithelial and
mesenchymal phenotype, as well as cancer stem cells. Such technology relies on the binding of the antibodies to the target CTCs in solution, which we have shown greatly improves the capture efficiency because of superior binding kinetics and the
lack of spatial constraints imposed by attachment of the antibodies to a solid surface. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>CEE-Enhanced Staining</I>. We have one U.S.
pending patent application (13/241,083)&nbsp;as well as its corresponding foreign patent applications directed to this technology. This technology was developed to enable detection of CTCs that do not express sufficient amounts of cytokeratin, an
epithelial marker that, in conjunction with DAPI and CD45 staining, is used to identify CTCs. It has made it possible to detect non-traditional CTCs, including mesenchymal types such as result from EMT, which, in conjunction with the antibody
capture cocktail, has significantly increased the sensitivity of our CTC assays, and the informative rate for clinical samples. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>CEE-Selector Mutation Detection Technology</I>. This technology was developed to perform mutation analysis on CTCs, ctDNA or other sample
types. It addresses the challenge of a sample in which copies of the normal gene locus vastly exceed the copies of the mutant gene locus. The technology has been demonstrated to have utility for more-sensitive mutation detection in ctDNA as well as
CTC analysis. It is co-owned with Aegea Biotechnologies, Inc., with Biocept having exclusive commercial rights for clinical oncology applications, including LDTs and IVDs, where tissue, blood, bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid are the sample
types. There are two pending U.S. patent applications (13/841,842 and 61/784,101), with Aegea responsible for the prosecution of U.S. provisional application 61/784,101 and Biocept responsible for the prosecution of the other U.S. patent
application. Biocept has also filed an international PCT application related to U.S. patent application 13/841,842. Lyle J. Arnold, Ph.D., our Senior Vice-President of Research&nbsp;&amp; Development and Chief Scientific Officer, is the controlling
person of Aegea. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2013, in <I>Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics</I>, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a
&#147;naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated,&#148; invalidating Myriad Genetics&#146; patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. This case removed some of the risk associated
with testing laboratories like ours using isolated nucleic acid fragments for molecular analysis. Testing laboratories have been uncertain as to whether analysis of gene mutations covered by third party patents would violate such patents. We will
continue to monitor developments in this area. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to patents, we hold five U.S. registered trademarks, including a federal

generated in a small in-house engineering shop. The manufacturing facility used for the production of our CEE microfluidic channels is a Class 10,000 suite in which polydimethylsiloxane is formed
into the base of our proprietary microfluidic channels in a molding process. A glass cover slip suitable for optical analysis is added to seal the channels and make them watertight by making them reactive using plasma techniques. The inside of the
microfluidic channels is subsequently chemically derivatized to enable the attachment of binding elements that strongly bind to antibody-tagged or coated CTCs. Because the microfluidic channels have micrometer dimensions, and we are seeking
individual cells in a blood sample to interact with the surface of the microfluidic channel, dust particles and other microscopic debris that could clog the channel needs to be avoided. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The process of performing our test is straightforward. When a health care professional takes a standard blood sample from a patient for CTC or
ctDNA testing, he or she will place the blood sample in our CEE-Sure blood collection tubes, complete a requisition form, and package the specimen in our shipping kit for direct shipment to us. Once we receive the specimen at our laboratory and we
enter all pertinent information about the specimen into our clinical laboratory information system, our laboratory technologists prepare the specimen for processing and analysis. Laboratory technologists, including clinical laboratory technologists
and clinical laboratory scientists then conduct the analysis, including enumeration of CTCs and biomarker analysis such as FISH. The data, including images and the processed cells, are sent to our in-house or contracted pathologists or a
commercialization partner&#146;s pathologists who are experienced in the analysis and evaluation requested by the referring oncologist or pathologist. </P>

to prepare a comprehensive report, which includes selected relevant images associated with the specimen. Our Internet reporting portal allows a referring oncologist or pathologist to access his or her patient&#146;s test results in real time in a
secure manner that we believe to be compliant with HIPAA and other applicable standards. The reports are generated in industry standard .pdf formats which allows for high definition color images to be reproduced clearly. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In all cases, we provide the technical analysis, and in the case of our OncoCEE-BR test under our 2013 agreement with Clarient, we also
provide the professional analysis. For our OncoCEE-LU test, while we would perform all of the technical analysis, the pathologists at our partner Life Technologies&#146; CLIA laboratory would provide the professional evaluation of the laboratory
data. For OncoCEE-BR tests, we will send the results to the ordering oncologist and bill the payor through an arrangement we have with Xifin, Inc. For OncoCEE-LU tests, Life Technologies would send out the report and bill the appropriate parties,
then pay us a predetermined fee for the technical analysis with a subsequent quarterly adjustment of that fee based on payments actually received by Life Technologies from payors. </P>

Reimbursement under the Medicare program for the diagnostic services that we offer is based on either the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule or the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, each of which is subject to geographic adjustments and is
updated annually. Medical services provided to Medicare beneficiaries that require a degree of physician supervision, judgment or other physician involvement, such as pathology services, are generally reimbursed under the Medicare Physician Fee

remaining 80%. There is currently no patient co-payment or co-insurance amount applicable to testing billed under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. Patients often have supplemental insurance policies that cover the co-insurance amount for
physician services. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Medicare has coverage policies that can be national or regional in scope. Coverage means that the test or assay is
approved as a benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. If there is no coverage, a provider may not bill Medicare or the beneficiary for the service. There is currently no national coverage policy regarding the CTC capture/enumeration portion of our
testing. The previous regional Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) for California, Palmetto GBA, LLC, adopted a negative coverage policy for CTC capture/enumeration (with the exception that Janssen Diagnostics, LLC&#146;s CellSearch<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> test has historically been covered for CTC capture/enumeration). The current MAC for California, Noridian Healthcare Solutions, LLC, is adopting the coverage policies from Palmetto GBA. Therefore
the capture/enumeration portion of our OncoCEE testing is not covered and we will receive no payment from Medicare for this service unless and until the coverage policy is changed. On November&nbsp;4, 2013, we submitted a comprehensive dossier to
Palmetto GBA and Noridian explaining the benefits of the capture/enumeration testing in order to seek to persuade the MACs to allow coverage for this portion of our testing. Palmetto GBA responded on November&nbsp;27, 2013, denying our request for
Medicare coverage for the enumeration/detection portion of our OncoCEE testing. We have not received any other indications to suggest that the negative coverage determination will be reversed. The earliest date we could submit another dossier on
this matter is May&nbsp;27, 2014. We intend to continue our efforts to obtain Medicare coverage for capture/enumeration. On the other hand, FISH analysis is a covered benefit for Medicare beneficiaries and accordingly we expect that the FISH portion
of OncoCEE-BR and our planned tests are and will be covered and that when and as we bill Medicare we will receive payment from Medicare under the Physician Fee Schedule for FISH analysis. Molecular testing for the mutations we currently plan to test
for with CEE-Selector is also a covered benefit, so we believe that CEE-Selector testing would thereby be covered and that when and as we bill Medicare we would receive payment from Medicare under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for
CEE-Selector testing. As discussed above, we have not yet received from Medicare any response or adjudication regarding any of our late-2013 billings, including for the FISH portion of OncoCEE-BR testing. </P>

participating provider, a covered provider or an &#147;out-of-network&#148; provider. These definitions can vary among payors, but we are generally considered an &#147;out-of-network&#148; or non-participating provider by the vast majority of
private third-party payors. An in-network provider usually has a contract with the payor or benefits provider. This contract governs, among other things, service-level agreements and reimbursement rates. In certain instances an insurance company may
negotiate an in-network rate for our testing. An in-network provider may have rates that are lower per test than those that are out-of-network, and that rate can vary widely. The rate varies based on the payor, the testing type and often the
specifics of the patient&#146;s insurance plan. If a laboratory agrees to contract as an in-network provider, it generally expects to receive quicker payment and access to additional covered patients. </P>

general &#147;stacking&#148; codes that were previously used to bill for these services with more test-specific codes. In the Physician Fee Schedule Rule issued in November 2012, CMS stated that it had determined it would pay for the new codes as
clinical laboratory tests under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. CMS has also started a process to &#147;gapfill&#148; the new codes. In other words, it will ask each of the MACs to determine a reasonable price for each of the new
codes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Changes in coding and reimbursement methods could have an adverse impact on our revenues going forward. However, we are currently
working with our billing consultants to determine what will be required by the new coding changes. The elimination of the &#147;stacking&#148; codes will require us to either use the new more specific codes where applicable effective January 2013,
or to use other &#147;Not Otherwise Classified&#148; codes when billing. The implementation of these new codes will vary from payor to payor, and it is too early to assess the impact, if any, that the migration to the new codes may have on our
results of operations. The introduction of the new codes by CMS, in combination with the other actions it is considering with regard to pricing, could result in a reduction in the payments that we receive for our current breast cancer test and our
planned future tests and make it more difficult to obtain coverage from Medicare or other payors. There can be no guarantees that Medicare and other payors will establish positive or adequate coverage policies or reimbursement rates. </P>

Physician Fee Schedule. For these established CPT codes (for example, the codes for FISH and immunocytochemistry, or ICC), positive coverage determinations have been adopted as part of national Medicare policy or under applicable Local Coverage
Determinations. Specific codes for our tests, however, do not assure an adequate coverage policy or reimbursement rate. Please see the section entitled &#147;Legislative and Regulatory Changes Impacting Clinical Laboratory Tests&#148; for further

with Clarient, under which Clarient had responsibility for billing and reimbursement until mid-2013, we do not have established coverage and reimbursement policies set with all third-party payors. Our Medicare Administrative Contractor has issued a
negative coverage determination for the capture/enumeration component of all CTC tests (with the exception that Janssen Diagnostics, LLC&#146;s CellSearch<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> test has historically been covered
for CTC capture/enumeration). We have received reimbursement for the capture/enumeration component of our tests from some payors, including major private third-party payors, based on submission of standard CPT codes. FISH, ICC and Molecular Testing
CPT codes are the subject of positive coverage national or local Medicare determinations. We believe these codes can be used to bill for the analysis components of our current and anticipated CTC tests. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect these analysis components to have a significantly greater reimbursement value than the capture/enumeration components of our current

We do not have data for Clarient&#146;s billing and collection experience with respect to our test, because Clarient paid us a contracted amount per test performed regardless of their billing and
collections. From May to December 2013, we performed an average of 1-3 physician-ordered tests per month (in addition to the 20-30 tests per month which we have been performing since January 2013 for a clinical utility study with investigators at
the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). Billing for these physician-ordered tests is now handled for us by a non-Clarient billing service provider. In 2013, we invoiced, through this service provider, for 17 physician-ordered tests. Of these,
8&nbsp;tests were billed to Medicare and the remainder were billed to other payors. We have been paid for one of these tests while we have not yet had any response or adjudication from any other payor as to the bills submitted in late 2013.
Accordingly, we do not yet have any data regarding reimbursement history or collectability experience. In addition, we believe the sample size of 17 is too small to be the basis for any conclusion about our ongoing payor mix. We cannot assure you
that, even if OncoCEE-BR and our planned tests are otherwise successful, reimbursement for the currently Medicare-covered portions of OncoCEE-BR and our planned tests would, without Medicare reimbursement for the capture/enumeration portion, produce
sufficient revenues to enable us to reach profitability and achieve our other commercial objectives. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Where there is a private or
governmental third-party payor coverage policy in place, we bill the payor and the patient in accordance with the established policy. Where there is no coverage policy in place, we pursue reimbursement on a case-by-case basis. Our efforts in
obtaining reimbursement based on individual claims, including pursuing appeals or reconsiderations of claims denials, could take a substantial amount of time, and bills may not be paid for many months, if at all. Furthermore, if a third-party payor
denies coverage after final appeal, payment may not be received at all. We are working to decrease risks of nonpayment by implementing a revenue cycle management system. </P>

across individual policies. Full or partial denial of coverage by payors, or reimbursement at inadequate levels, would have a material adverse impact on our business and on market acceptance of our tests. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">From time to time, Congress has revised the Medicare statute and the formulas it establishes for both the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee
Schedule and the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. The payment amounts under the Medicare fee schedules are important because they not only determine our reimbursement under Medicare, but those payment amounts are also often used as a basis for
payment amounts set by other governmental and private third -party payors. For example, state Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule limit for clinical laboratory services furnished to Medicaid recipients.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the statutory formula for Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule amounts, increases are made annually based on the Consumer
Price Index for All Urban Consumers as of June&nbsp;30 for the previous twelve-month period. From 2004-2008, Congress eliminated the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers update in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization
Act of 2003. In addition, for years 2009 through 2013, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 mandated an approximately 0.5% cut to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers update. Accordingly, the update for 2009
was reduced to 4.5% and negative 1.9% for 2010. The ACA has, among other things, imposed additional cuts to the Medicare reimbursement for clinical laboratories. The ACA replaced the 0.5% cut enacted by the Medicare Improvements for Patients and
Providers Act with a &#147;productivity adjustment&#148; that will reduce the Consumer Price Index update in payments for clinical laboratory tests. In 2011, the productivity adjustment was -1.2%. In addition, the ACA includes a separate 1.75%
reduction in the CPI update for clinical laboratories for the years 2011 through 2015. The MCTRJCA, enacted in 2012, mandated an additional change in reimbursement for clinical laboratory service programs. This legislation requires CMS to reduce the
Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule by 2% in 2013, which in turn will serve as a base for 2014 and subsequent years. CMS has projected that because of the changes required by ACA and MCTRJCA, payment for clinical laboratory services will go
down by approximately 3% by 2013. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With respect to our diagnostic services for which we expect to be reimbursed under the Medicare
Physician Fee Schedule, because of the statutory formula the rates would have decreased for the past several years if Congress failed to intervene. In the past, when the application of the statutory formula results in lower payment, Congress has
passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. In November 2013, CMS issued its 2014 Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule, or the 2014 Final Rule. In the 2014 Final Rule, CMS called for a reduction of approximately 23.7% in the 2014 conversion
factor that is used to calculate physician reimbursement. If in future years Congress does not adopt interim legislation to block or offset, and/or CMS does not moderate, any substantial CMS-proposed reimbursement reductions, the resulting decrease
in payments from Medicare could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations. In addition, for 2012, CMS requested that the American Medical Association&#146;s Relative Value Scale Update Committee reexamine the relative values of certain
codes, including FISH codes. The Relative Value Scale Update Committee is an expert panel that provides relative value recommendations to CMS for use in annual updates to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. These relative values are used by CMS to
determine payments, and CMS seeks to assess whether such codes are misvalued and an adjustment is necessary. In July 2013 CMS published the proposed Physician Fee Schedule for 2014. As part of that proposed rule, CMS sought to decrease payment for
approximately 200 CPT codes, including those for certain anatomic and molecular pathology services, to make payments to independent laboratories and hospital outpatient departments consistent. The proposed rates were generally lower than the current
rates paid to independent laboratories and physicians for the same services. For example, CMS proposed to decrease the reimbursement rate for the technical component of FISH analysis by 47%. In fact, the 2014 Final Rule as adopted left FISH
reimbursement rates for independent laboratories and physicians essentially unchanged from 2013 reimbursement levels. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the
2014 Final Rule included both increases and decreases in certain relative value units and geographic adjustment factors used to determine reimbursement for a number of codes used in our current breast cancer test and our planned future tests. These
codes describe services that we must perform in connection with our tests and we bill for these codes in connection with the services that we provide. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, with respect to the Medicare program, Congress has proposed on several occasions to impose a 20% coinsurance charge on patients for
clinical laboratory tests reimbursed under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, which would require us to bill patients for these amounts. Because of the relatively low reimbursement for many clinical laboratory tests, in the event that
Congress were to ever enact such legislation, the cost of billing and collecting for these services would often exceed the amount actually received from the patient and effectively increase our costs of billing and collecting. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of our Medicare claims may be subject to policies issued by Palmetto GBA and Noridian Healthcare Solutions, our former and current
Medicare Administrative Contractor for California, respectively. Palmetto GBA, acting on behalf of many MACs, recently issued a Local Coverage Decision that affects coverage, coding and billing of many molecular diagnostic tests. Under this Local
Coverage Determination, Palmetto GBA will not cover any molecular diagnostic tests, such as the capture/enumeration component of our current breast cancer test and our planned future tests, unless the test is expressly included in a National
Coverage Determination issued by CMS or a Local Coverage Determination or coverage article issued by Palmetto GBA. Currently, laboratories may submit coverage determination requests to Palmetto GBA for consideration and apply for a unique billing
code for each test (which is a separate process from the coverage determination). In the event that a non-coverage determination is issued, the laboratory must wait six months following the determination to submit a new request. In addition,
effective January&nbsp;1, 2013, Palmetto GBA implemented its new Molecular Diagnostic Services Program, under which, among other things, laboratories must use the newly-assigned billing codes specific to the test (as implemented by the American
Medical Association), in order to receive the indicated reimbursement amounts. Reimbursement amounts under these new single molecular diagnostics billing codes were in some cases lower, and in some cases higher, than amounts allowed by Medicare
before January&nbsp;1, 2013, but most were significantly lower. Palmetto GBA currently has a negative coverage determination for the capture/enumeration component of CTC tests such as our current and anticipated CTC tests, but there is no such

patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. Our laboratory holds a CLIA certificate of accreditation. As to state laws, we are required to meet certain laboratory licensing and other requirements. Our laboratory holds the
required licenses from the applicable state agencies in which we operate. For more information on state licensing requirements, see the sections entitled see the section entitled &#147;Description of the Business&#151;Governmental
Regulations&#151;California State Laboratory Licensing&#148; and &#147;Description of the Business&#151;Governmental Regulations&#151;Other States&#146; Laboratory Licensing.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under CLIA, a laboratory is defined as any facility which performs laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of
providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the impairment of, or assessment of health of human beings. CLIA also requires that we hold a certificate applicable to the complexity of the categories of testing we
perform and that we comply with certain standards. CLIA further regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring they comply with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements
intended to ensure that their clinical laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. CLIA certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill for services provided to state and federal health care program beneficiaries. CLIA
is user-fee funded. Therefore, all costs of administering the program must be covered by the regulated facilities, including certification and survey costs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards, and may be subject to additional
unannounced inspections. Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than laboratories performing less complex tests. In addition, a laboratory like ours that is certified as &#147;high
complexity&#148; under CLIA may obtain analyte specific reagents, which are used to develop LDTs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to CLIA requirements, we
must comply with the standards set by CAP, which accredits our laboratory. Under CMS requirements, accreditation by CAP is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of CLIA. Therefore, because we are accredited by CAP, we are deemed to also comply with
CLIA. CLIA also provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law, and certain states have implemented their own more stringent laboratory regulatory schemes. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A variety of federal and state laws prohibit fraud and abuse. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and
federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for HHS, and various state agencies. In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly use a variety of contractors to review claims data and to
identify improper payments as well as fraud </P>

and abuse. These contractors include Recovery Audit Contractors, Medicaid Integrity Contractors and Zone Program Integrity Contractors. In addition, CMS conducts Comprehensive Error Rate Testing
audits, the purpose of which is to detect improper Medicare payments. Any overpayments identified must be repaid unless a favorable decision is obtained on appeal. In some cases, these overpayments can be used as the basis for an extrapolation, by
which the error rate is applied to a larger universe of claims, and which can result in even higher repayments. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The federal Anti-Kickback
Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing,
recommending, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program. The definition of &#147;remuneration&#148; has been broadly interpreted to include
anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit
many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the Office of Inspector General for HHS has issued a series of regulatory &#147;safe harbors.&#148; These safe harbor regulations set forth certain requirements that, if met,
will assure immunity from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit
within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. For further discussion of the impact of federal and state health care
fraud and abuse laws and regulations on our business, see the section entitled &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Regulatory Risks Relating to Our Business.&#148; We are subject to federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations and could
face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the administrative simplification regulations
discussed above, HIPAA also created two new federal crimes; health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit
program, including private third-party payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from federal health care programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The false statements statute
prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. A
violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from federal health care programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Finally,
another development affecting the health care industry is the increased enforcement of the federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act&#146;s &#147;whistleblower&#148; or &#147;qui tam&#148;
provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. The qui tam provisions of the
False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government and permit such individuals to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition, various states have
enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, and some of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay
up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, in Europe various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties
and/or significant fines for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offence. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. For
instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act 2010, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or

any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act
2010 faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Physician Referral Prohibitions </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under a federal law directed at &#147;self-referral,&#148; commonly known as the Stark Law, there are prohibitions, with certain exceptions, on
Medicare and Medicaid payments for laboratory tests referred by physicians who personally, or through a family member, have a &#147;financial relationship&#148;&#151;including an investment or ownership interest or a compensation
arrangement&#151;with the clinical laboratory performing the tests. Several Stark Law exceptions are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: (1)&nbsp;fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services;
(2)&nbsp;payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; (3)&nbsp;certain space and equipment rental arrangements that satisfy certain requirements, and (4)&nbsp;personal services arrangements. The laboratory cannot submit
claims to the Medicare Part B program for services furnished in violation of the Stark Law, and Medicaid reimbursements may be at risk as well. Penalties for violating the Stark Law include the return of funds received for all prohibited referrals,
fines, civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. Many states have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals. </P>

number of states, including California, do not allow business corporations to employ physicians to provide professional services. This prohibition against the &#147;corporate practice of medicine&#148; is aimed at preventing corporations such as us
from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians. The state licensure statutes and regulations and agency and court decisions that enumerate the specific corporate practice rules vary considerably from state to state and
are enforced by both the courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. If regulatory authorities or other parties in any jurisdiction successfully assert that we are engaged in the unauthorized corporate practice of medicine, we
could be required to restructure our contractual and other arrangements. In addition, violation of these laws may result in sanctions imposed against us and/or the professional through licensure proceedings, and we could be subject to civil and
criminal penalties that could result in exclusion from state and federal health care programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Direct Billing Laws and Other State Law Restrictions
on Billing for Laboratory Services </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Laws and regulations in certain states prohibit laboratories from billing physicians or other
purchasers for testing that they order. Some of those laws and regulations apply only to anatomic pathology services while others extend to other types of testing. Some states may allow laboratories to bill physicians directly but may prohibit the
physician (and, in some cases, other purchasers) from charging more than the purchase price for the services (or may allow only for the recovery of acquisition costs) or may require disclosure of certain information on the invoice. In some cases,
and if not prohibited by law or regulation, we may bill physicians, hospitals and other laboratories directly for the services that they order. An increase in the number of states that impose similar restrictions could adversely affect us by
encouraging physicians to perform laboratory services in-house or by causing physicians to refer services to other laboratories that are not subject to the same restrictions. </P>

the states where specimens originate require that the physician interpreting those specimens be licensed by that particular state. Physicians who fail to comply with these licensure requirements could face fines or other penalties for practicing
medicine without a license and we could be required to pay those fines on behalf of our pathologists or subject to liability under the federal False Claims Act and similar state laws if we bill for services furnished by unlicensed pathologists. We
do not believe that the services our pathologist performs constitute the practice of medicine in any state that requires out-of-state physician licensure. Our pathologist thus is not required to obtain licensure in any state where he does not
reside. </P>

were unrelated to cancer diagnostics. The portion of our accumulated deficit that relates to the period from inception through December&nbsp;31, 2007 is approximately $66.5 million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect our losses to continue as a result of costs relating to our lab operations as well as increased sales and marketing costs and
ongoing research and development expenses. These losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our working capital, total assets and stockholders&#146; equity. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our
commercialization efforts, we are unable to predict when we will become profitable, and we may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our
inability to achieve and then maintain profitability would negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our chief executive officer Michael W. Nall, who joined us in August 2013, has not previously been
the chief executive officer of a public or private company, and therefore his lack of experience may result in some of his time being spent acclimating to his new position and responsibilities. A lack of significant experience in being the chief

any clinical reference laboratory facilities outside of our facility in San Diego, California. Our facilities and equipment could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including fire, earthquake, flooding and power
outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our diagnostic tests for some period of time. The inability to perform our current test and our planned tests or the backlog of tests that could develop if our facility is
inoperable for even a short period of time may result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation or relationships with scientific or clinical collaborators, and we may be unable to regain those customers or repair our reputation in the

development. In some cases, these samples are difficult to obtain. If the parts of our laboratory facility where we store these biological samples were damaged or compromised, our ability to pursue our research and development projects, as well as
our reputation, could be jeopardized. We carry insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on

mainstream diagnostic methods, used by pathologists and oncologists for many years, which focus on tumor tissue analysis. It may be difficult to change the methods or behavior of oncologists to incorporate our CTC and ctDNA testing, including
molecular diagnostic testing, in their practices in conjunction with or instead of tissue biopsies and analysis. In addition, companies offering capital equipment and kits or reagents to local pathology laboratories represent another source of
potential competition. These kits are used directly by the pathologist, which can facilitate adoption. We plan to focus our marketing and sales efforts on medical oncologists rather than pathologists. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also face competition from companies that offer products or are conducting research to develop
products for CTC or ctDNA testing in various cancers. In particular, Janssen Diagnostics, LLC markets its CellSearch<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> test and Atossa Genetics markets its ArgusCYTE<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> test, which are competitive to our OncoCEE-BR test for CTC enumeration, and HER2 analysis, respectively. CTC and ctDNA testing is a new area of science and we cannot predict what tests others
will develop that may compete with or provide results similar or superior to the results we are able to achieve with the tests we develop. In addition to Janssen Diagnostics and Atossa Genetics, our competitors also include public companies such as
Alere (Adnagen) and Illumina as well as many private companies, including Apocell, EPIC Sciences, Clearbridge Biomedics, Cynvenio Biosystems, Fluxion Biosciences, RareCells, ScreenCell and Silicon Biosystems. Many of these groups, in addition to
operating research and development laboratories, are establishing CLIA-certified testing laboratories while others are focused on selling equipment and reagents. Our sales and distribution agreements are non-exclusive and our partners could enter
into agreements with competitors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus attention and
resources on the personalized cancer diagnostic sector as the potential and prevalence of molecularly targeted oncology therapies approved by the FDA along with companion diagnostics increases. For example, the FDA has recently approved two such
agents&#151;Xalkori<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> from Pfizer Inc. along with its companion anaplastic lymphoma kinase FISH test from Abbott Laboratories, Inc.,

competitors may invent and commercialize technology platforms or tests that compete with ours. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are a number of companies which are
focused on the oncology diagnostic market, such as Biodesix, Caris, Clarient, Foundation Medicine, Neogenomics, Response Genetics, Agendia, Genomic Health, and Genoptix, who while not currently offering CTC or ctDNA tests are selling to the medical
oncologists and pathologists and could develop or offer CTC or ctDNA tests. Large laboratory services companies, such as Sonic USA, Quest and LabCorp, provide more generalized cancer diagnostic testing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, projects related to cancer diagnostics and particularly genomics have received increased government funding, both in the United
States and internationally. As more information regarding cancer genomics becomes available to the public, we anticipate that more products aimed at identifying targeted treatment options will be developed and that these products may compete with
ours. In addition, competitors may develop their own versions of our current or planned tests in countries where we did not apply for patents or where our patents have not issued and compete with us in those countries, including encouraging the use
of their test by physicians or patients in other countries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of our present and potential competitors have widespread brand
recognition and substantially greater financial and technical resources and development, production and marketing capabilities than we do. Others may develop lower-priced, less complex tests that payors, pathologists and oncologists could view as
functionally equivalent to our current or planned tests, which could force us to lower the list price of our tests and impact our operating margins and our ability to achieve and maintain profitability. In addition, technological innovations that
result in the creation of enhanced diagnostic tools that are more sensitive or specific than ours may enable other clinical laboratories, hospitals, physicians or medical providers to provide specialized diagnostic tests similar to ours in a more
patient-friendly, efficient or cost-effective manner than is currently possible. If we cannot compete successfully against current or future competitors, we may be unable to increase or create market acceptance and sales of our current or planned
tests, which could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues or achieving or sustaining profitability. </P>

educational programs and one-on-one education sessions by members of our sales force. In addition, we need to assure oncologists of our ability to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement coverage from third-party payors. We need to hire
additional commercial, scientific, technical and other personnel to support this process. If we cannot convince medical practitioners to order our current test and our planned tests, we will likely be unable to create demand in sufficient volume for

commercial adoption of such test may be slow, which would negatively impact our business. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinical utility studies show when and
how to use a clinical test, and describe the particular clinical situations or settings in which it can be applied and the expected results. Clinical utility studies also show the impact of the test results on patient care and management. Clinical
utility studies are typically performed with collaborating oncologists at medical centers and hospitals, analogous to a clinical trial, and generally result in peer-reviewed publications. Sales and marketing representatives use these publications to
demonstrate to customers how to use a clinical test, as well as why they should use it. These publications are also used with payors to obtain coverage for a test, helping to assure there is appropriate reimbursement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are currently conducting a clinical utility study for our OncoCEE-BR test with investigators at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We will
need to conduct additional studies for this test, as well as other CTC and ctDNA tests we plan to introduce, to drive test adoption in the marketplace and reimbursement. Should we not be able to perform these studies, or should their results not
provide clinically meaningful data and value for oncologists, adoption of our tests could be impaired and we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for them. </P>

of health information and personal data. As part of the American Recovery and Investment Act 2009, or ARRA, Congress amended the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. HIPAA imposes
limitations on the use and disclosure of an individual&#146;s healthcare information by healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouses, and health insurance plans, collectively referred to as covered entities. The HIPAA amendments also impose
compliance obligations and corresponding penalties for non-compliance on individuals and entities that provide services to healthcare providers and other covered entities, collectively referred to as business associates. ARRA also made significant
increases in the penalties for improper use or disclosure of an individual&#146;s health information under HIPAA and extended enforcement authority to state attorneys general. The amendments also create notification requirements for individuals
whose health information has been inappropriately accessed or disclosed: notification requirements to federal regulators and in some cases, notification to local and national media. Notification is not required under HIPAA if the health information
that is improperly used or disclosed is deemed secured in accordance with encryption or other standards developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. Most states have laws requiring notification of affected individuals and
state regulators in the event of a breach of personal information, which is a broader class of information than the health information protected by HIPAA. Many state laws impose significant data security requirements, such as encryption or mandatory
contractual terms to ensure ongoing protection of personal information. Activities outside of the United States implicate local and national data protection standards, impose additional compliance requirements and generate additional risks of
enforcement for non-compliance. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws, to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate
problems caused by such breaches. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We depend on our information technology and telecommunications systems, and any failure of these systems could

number of state governors, resulting in lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions of the ACA. In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA, with the exception of certain provisions dealing with the
expansion of Medicaid coverage under the law. Therefore, most of the law&#146;s provisions will go into effect in 2013 and 2014. Congress has also proposed a number of legislative initiatives, including possible repeal of the ACA. At this time, it

changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select
Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare
payments to providers and suppliers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, starting in 2013. The full impact on our business of the ACA and the sequester law is uncertain. In addition, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, or MCTRJCA,
mandated an additional change in Medicare reimbursement for clinical laboratory tests. This legislation requires a rebasing of the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule to effect a 2% reduction in payment rates otherwise determined for 2013.
This will serve as a base for 2014 and subsequent years. In January 2013, as a result of the changes mandated by the ACA and MCTRJCA, the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, reduced its reimbursement for laboratory tests for
2013 by approximately 3%. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of our laboratory test business is subject to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and, under the current
statutory formula, the rates for these services are updated annually. For the past several years, the application of the statutory formula would have resulted in substantial payment reductions if Congress failed to intervene. In the past, Congress
passed interim legislation to prevent the decreases. On November&nbsp;1, 2013, CMS issued its 2014 Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule, or the 2014 Final Rule. In the 2014 Final Rule, CMS called </P>

offset, and/or CMS does not moderate, any substantial CMS-proposed reimbursement reductions, the resulting decrease in payments from Medicare could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, many of the Current Procedure Terminology, or CPT, codes that we use to bill for cancer diagnostic tests were revised by the
American Medical Association, effective January&nbsp;1, 2013. In the 2013 Final Rule, CMS announced that it has decided to keep the new molecular codes on the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule rather than move them to the Physician Fee Schedule as
some stakeholders had urged. Our reimbursement could be adversely affected by CMS&#146; actions. If it reduces reimbursement for the new test codes or does not pay for our codes, then our revenues would be adversely affected. There can be no
guarantees that Medicare and other payors will establish positive or adequate coverage policies or reimbursement rates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July&nbsp;9,
2013, CMS issued a proposed Physician Fee Schedule revision that would, in the aggregate, impose a 25% reduction for payments for pathology codes when services are provided by independent laboratories, to take effect beginning with calendar year
2014. The proposed cuts for certain services were drastic. For example, reimbursement for the technical component of FISH analysis would have been cut by 68%. We cannot predict the outcome of this initiative. However, the 2014 Physician Fee Schedule
Final Rule issued by CMS in November 2013 left FISH reimbursement rates for independent laboratories and physicians essentially unchanged from 2013 reimbursement levels. </P>

planned future cancer diagnostic tests, may reduce our profits, if any, and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, Congress has proposed on several occasions to impose a
20% coinsurance payment requirement on patients for clinical laboratory tests reimbursed under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, which would require us to bill patients for these amounts. In the event that Congress were to ever enact
such legislation, the cost of billing and collecting for our tests could often exceed the amount actually received from the patient. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our commercial

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because each payor generally determines for its own enrollees or insured patients whether to cover or otherwise establish a policy to
reimburse our cancer diagnostic tests, seeking payor approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. We cannot be certain that coverage for our current test and our planned future tests will be provided in the future by additional third-party
payors or that existing agreements, policy decisions or reimbursement levels will remain in place or be fulfilled under existing terms and provisions. If we cannot obtain coverage and reimbursement from private and governmental payors such as
Medicare and Medicaid for our current test, or new tests or test enhancements that we may develop in the future, our ability to generate revenues could be limited, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flow. Further, we have experienced in the past, and will likely experience in the future, delays and interruptions in the receipt of payments from third-party payors due to missing documentation and/or other issues, which could
cause delay in collecting our revenue. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, to the extent that our testing is ordered for Medicare inpatients and outpatients,
only the hospital may receive payment from the Medicare program for the technical component of pathology services and any clinical laboratory services that we perform, unless the testing is ordered at least 14 days after discharge and certain other
requirements are met. We therefore must look to the hospital for payment for these services under these circumstances. If hospitals refuse to pay for the services or fail to pay in a timely manner, our ability to generate revenues could be limited,
which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We expect to depend on Medicare and a

almost all Americans age 65 and older are enrolled in Medicare, that a substantial portion of the patients for whom we would expect to perform cancer diagnostic tests will have Medicare as their primary medical insurance. Only in November 2013 did
we first directly bill any payor for physician-ordered testing; until May 2013, our commercialization partner Clarient was responsible for all billing associated with our tests. We do not have data for Clarient&#146;s billing and collection
experience with respect to our test, because Clarient paid us a contracted amount per test performed regardless of their billing and collections. From May to December 2013, we performed an average of 1-3 physician-ordered tests per month (in
addition to the 20-30 tests per month which we have been performing since January 2013 for a clinical utility study with investigators at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). Billing for physician-ordered tests is now handled for us by a non-Clarient
billing service provider. In 2013 we invoiced, through this service provider, for 17 physician-ordered tests. Of these, 8 tests were billed to Medicare and the remainder were billed to other payors. We have been paid for one of these tests while we
have not yet had any response or adjudication from any other payor as to the bills submitted in late 2013. Accordingly, we do not yet have any data regarding reimbursement history or collectability experience. In addition, we believe the sample size
of 17 is too small to be the basis for any conclusion about our ongoing payor mix. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Medicare and other third-party payors may change their
coverage policies or cancel future contracts with us at any time, review and adjust the rate of reimbursement or stop paying for our tests altogether, which would reduce our total revenues. Payors have increased their efforts to control the cost,
utilization and delivery of health care services. In the past, measures have been undertaken to reduce payment rates for and decrease utilization of the clinical laboratory testing generally. Because of the cost-trimming trends, third-party payors
that currently cover and provide reimbursement for our current breast cancer test and our planned future cancer diagnostic tests may suspend, revoke or discontinue coverage at any time, or may reduce the reimbursement rates payable to us.

a specific contract to provide cancer diagnostic tests to their insured patients at specified rates of reimbursement. If we were to become a contracted provider with one more payors in the future, the amount of overall reimbursement we receive would
likely decrease because we could be reimbursed less money per test performed at a contracted rate than at a non-contracted rate, which could have a negative impact on our revenues. Further, we typically are unable to collect payments from patients
beyond that which is paid by their insurance and will continue to experience lost revenue as a result. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Because of certain Medicare billing

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Medicare has coverage policies that can be national or regional in scope. Coverage means that the test or assay is approved as a benefit for
Medicare beneficiaries. If there is no coverage, neither the supplier nor any other party, such as a reference laboratory, may bill Medicare or the beneficiary for the service. There is currently no national coverage policy regarding the CTC
capture/enumeration portion of our testing. Because our laboratory is in California, the regional Medicare Administrative Contractor , or MAC, for California is the relevant MAC for all our testing. The previous MAC for California, Palmetto GBA,
LLC, adopted a negative coverage policy for CTC capture/enumeration (with the exception that Janssen Diagnostics, LLC&#146;s CellSearch<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> test has historically been covered for CTC
capture/enumeration). The current MAC for California, Noridian Healthcare Solutions, LLC, is adopting the coverage policies from Palmetto GBA. Therefore the capture/enumeration portion of our OncoCEE testing is not currently covered and we will
receive no payment from Medicare for this service unless and until the coverage policy is changed. On November&nbsp;4, 2013, we submitted a comprehensive dossier explaining to Palmetto GBA and Noridian the benefits of the capture/enumeration testing
in order to seek to persuade the MACs to allow coverage for this portion of our testing. Palmetto GBA responded on November&nbsp;27, 2013, denying our request for Medicare coverage for the CTC capture/enumeration portion of our OncoCEE testing. We
have not received any other indications to suggest that the negative coverage determination will be reversed. The earliest date we could submit another dossier on this matter is May&nbsp;27, 2014. We intend to continue our efforts to obtain Medicare

guidance regarding initiatives that may require varying levels of FDA oversight of our current test and our planned future tests. For example, in June 2010, the FDA announced a public meeting to
discuss the agency&#146;s oversight of LDTs prompted by the increased complexity of LDTs and their increasingly important role in clinical decision-making and disease management, particularly in the context of personalized medicine. The FDA
indicated that it was considering a risk-based application of oversight to LDTs and that, following public input and discussion, it might issue separate draft guidance on the regulation of LDTs, which ultimately could require that we seek and obtain
either pre-market clearance or approval of LDTs, depending upon the risk-based approach the FDA adopts. The public meeting was held in July 2010 and further public comments were submitted to the FDA through September 2010. The FDA has stated it is
continuing to develop draft guidance in this area. Section&nbsp;1143 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 requires the FDA to notify U.S. Congress at least 60 days before issuing a draft or final guidance regulating
LDTs and to provide details of the anticipated action. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We cannot provide any assurance that FDA regulation, including pre-market review,

Congress continues to give to these issues, legislation affecting this area may be enacted into law and may result in increased regulatory burdens on us as we continue to offer our test and to develop and introduce new tests. </P>

commercialization of tests in development. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The requirement of pre-market review could negatively affect our business until such review is
completed and clearance to market or approval is obtained. The FDA could require that we stop selling our cancer diagnostic tests pending pre-market clearance or approval. If the FDA allows our tests to remain on the market but there is uncertainty
about our tests, if they are labeled investigational by the FDA or if labeling claims the FDA allows us to make are very limited, orders from oncologists or reimbursement may decline. The regulatory approval process may involve, among other things,
successfully completing additional clinical trials and making a 510(k) submission, or filing a pre-market approval application with the FDA. If the FDA requires pre-market review, our tests may not be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at
all. We may also decide voluntarily to pursue FDA pre-market review of our tests if we determine that doing so would be appropriate. </P>

our clinical laboratory. Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our test claims or that the FDA or foreign authorities will agree with our conclusions regarding our test results.
Success in early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the later trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and studies. If we are required to conduct pre-market
clinical trials, whether using prospectively acquired samples or archival samples, delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly increase our test development costs and delay commercialization. Many of the factors
that may cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to delay or denial of regulatory clearance or approval. The commencement of clinical trials may be delayed due to insufficient patient
enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. Moreover, the clinical trial
process may fail to demonstrate that our current test and our planned future tests are effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could cause us to abandon a test candidate and may delay development of other tests. </P>

their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, our clinical
trials may have to be extended, delayed or terminated. Many of these factors would be beyond our control. We may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without undue delays or considerable expenditures. If there are delays in testing or
approvals as a result of the failure to perform by third parties, our research and development costs would increase, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for our current test and our planned future tests. In addition, we
may not be able to establish or maintain relationships with these parties on favorable terms, if at all. Each of these outcomes would harm our ability to market our tests or to achieve sustained profitability. </P>

criminal health care fraud statutes. Where the intent requirement has been lowered, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, because of amendments enacted in 2009 as
part of the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, the government may now assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false

Health Information by health care providers engaging in certain electronic transactions or &#147;standard transactions.&#148; They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her Protected Health Information
maintained by a covered health care provider, including the right to access or amend certain records containing Protected Health Information or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of Protected Health Information. The HIPAA security
regulations establish administrative, physical and technical standards for maintaining the integrity and availability of Protected Health Information in electronic form. These standards apply to covered health care providers and also to
&#147;business associates&#148; or third parties providing services involving the use or disclosure of Protected Health Information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal &#147;floor&#148; and do not supersede state
laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing Protected Health Information. As a result, we may be required to comply with both HIPAA

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinical research is subject to federal, state and, for studies conducted outside of the United States, international regulation. At the
federal level, the FDA imposes regulations for the protection of human subjects and requirements such as initial and ongoing institutional review board review; informed consent requirements, adverse event reporting and other protections to minimize
the risk and maximize the benefit to research participants. Many states impose human subject protection laws that mirror or in some cases exceed federal requirements. HIPAA also regulates the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information in
connection with research activities. Research conducted overseas is subject to a variety of national protections such as mandatory ethics committee review, as well as laws regulating the use, disclosure and cross-border transfer of personal data.
The costs of compliance with these laws may be significant and compliance with regulatory requirements may result in delay. Noncompliance may disrupt our research and result in data that is unacceptable to regulatory authorities, data lock or other
sanctions that may significantly disrupt our operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Violation of a state&#146;s prohibition on the corporate practice of medicine could result

employ physicians to provide professional services. This prohibition against the &#147;corporate practice of medicine&#148; is aimed at preventing corporations such as us from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians.
The state licensure statutes and regulations and agency and court decisions that enumerate the specific corporate practice rules vary considerably from state to state and are enforced by both the courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad
discretion. If regulatory authorities or other parties in any jurisdiction successfully assert that we are engaged in the unauthorized corporate practice of medicine, we could be required to restructure our contractual and other arrangements. In
addition, violation of these laws may result in sanctions imposed against us and/or the professional through licensure proceedings, and we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could result in exclusion from state and federal health

Currently, we rely on a combination of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications, copyrights, trademarks and trademark applications, confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements, material transfer agreements, licenses, consulting agreements,
work-for-hire agreements and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We also maintain certain company know-how, trade secrets and technological innovations designed to provide us with a competitive advantage in
the market place as trade secrets. Currently, we own 3 issued U.S. patents, 6 pending U.S. patent applications and their corresponding foreign patents and patent applications, relevant to our cancer diagnostics business, as well as 2 pending U.S.
patent applications and their corresponding foreign patent applications we jointly own with Aegea Biotechnologies, Inc. (for which we have the exclusive rights for specified fields of use). While we intend to pursue additional patent applications,
it is possible that our pending patent applications and any future applications may not result in issued patents. Even if patents are issued, third parties may independently develop similar or competing technology that avoids our patents. Further,
we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our trade secrets and other confidential information as well as the misuse of our patents and other intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where
we have not filed for patent protection. In addition, if Aegea Biotechnologies, Inc. were to challenge the scope of our rights under or attempt to terminate its Assignment and Exclusive Cross-License Agreement with us, our ability to use the
technologies we in-license from Aegea, or to prevent others from using them in the fields of use for which we have an exclusive license, could be compromised. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">From time to time the U.S. Supreme Court, other federal courts, the U.S. Congress or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, may
change the standards of patentability and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business. For instance, in 2008, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision that methods or processes cannot be patented unless they
are tied to a machine or involve a physical transformation. The U.S. Supreme Court later reversed that decision in <I>Bilski v. Kappos</I>, finding that the &#147;machine-or-transformation&#148; test is not the only test for determining patent
eligibility. The Court, however, declined to specify how and when processes are patentable. In 2012, in the case <I>Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc.</I>, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit&#146;s
application of <I>Bilski</I> and invalidated a patent focused on a diagnostic process because the patent claim embodied a law of nature. It is unclear at this time whether the USPTO will amend its patent prosecution guidelines for determining
patentability of diagnostic or other processes, and how lower courts will implement the decision. Some aspects of our technology involve processes that may be subject to this evolving standard and we cannot guarantee that any of our pending process
claims will be patentable as a result of such evolving standards. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2013, in <I>Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad
Genetics</I>, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that, &#147;A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated,&#148; invalidating Myriad Genetics&#146; patents on the BRCA1 and
BRCA2 genes. However, the Supreme Court also held that manipulation of a gene to create something not found in nature, such as a strand of synthetically-produced complementary DNA, could still be eligible for patent protection. The Supreme Court
noted that method patents, which concern technical procedures for carrying out a certain process, are not affected by the ruling. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It
should also be noted that in 2010, the Secretary&#146;s Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health and Society voted to approve a report entitled &#147;Gene Patents and Licensing Practices and Their Impact on Patient Access to Genetic Tests.&#148; That
report defines &#147;patent claims on genes&#148; broadly to include claims to isolated nucleic acid molecules as well as methods of detecting particular sequences or mutations. The report also contains six recommendations, including the creation of
an exemption from liability for infringement of patent claims on genes for anyone making, using, ordering, offering for sale or selling a test developed under the patent for patient care purposes, or for anyone using the patent-protected genes in
the pursuit of research. The report also recommended that HHS should explore, identify and implement mechanisms that will encourage more voluntary adherence to current guidelines that promote nonexclusive in-licensing of diagnostic genetic and
genomic technologies. It is unclear whether HHS will act upon these recommendations, or if the recommendations would result in a change in law or process that could negatively impact our patent portfolio or future research and development efforts.

intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims from third parties. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. The outcome of any such litigation can never be guaranteed, and an adverse outcome could affect us negatively. For
example, were a third-party to succeed on an infringement claim against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages if such infringement were found to be willful. In addition, we could face an injunction, barring us
from conducting the allegedly infringing activity. The outcome of the litigation could require us to enter into a license agreement which may not be pursuant to acceptable or commercially reasonable or practical terms or which may not be available
at all. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is also possible that an adverse finding of infringement against us may require us to dedicate substantial resources and time

have affected the market prices for the securities of newly public companies for a number of reasons, including reasons that may be unrelated to our business or operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may result in a material decline
in the market price of our common stock and you may not be able to sell your shares at prices you deem acceptable. In the past, following periods of volatility in the equity markets, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against
public companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management attention. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our

minimum closing bid price requirement, NASDAQ may take steps to de-list our common stock. Such a de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when
you wish to do so. In the event of a de-listing, we would take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ&#146;s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed
again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ&#146;s listing requirements. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally
equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with
respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not obtain or retain a listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock will be deemed a penny
stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock
rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive
(i)&nbsp;the purchaser&#146;s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii)&nbsp;a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii)&nbsp;a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement.
These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares. </P>

which are restricted securities that may be sold only in accordance with the resale restrictions under Rule&nbsp;144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In addition, as of December&nbsp;31, 2013, we had outstanding options to purchase 333,106
shares of our common stock and outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our common and Series A preferred stock overlying an estimated aggregate of 1,029,152 common stock equivalents. We plan to register for offer and sale the shares of common
stock that are reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding options. Shares covered by such registration statements upon the exercise of stock options generally will be eligible for sale in the public market, except that affiliates will continue to

our business, our market or our competitors. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock
would be negatively impacted. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover

internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved
controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section&nbsp;404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent
testing by our independent registered public accounting firm conducted in connection with Section&nbsp;404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act after we no longer qualify as an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; may reveal deficiencies in our internal
controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior
internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are required to disclose changes made in our internal control procedures on a quarterly basis and our management is required to assess the
effectiveness of these controls annually. However, for as long as we are an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; under the recently enacted JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section&nbsp;404. We could be an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; for up to five years. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could
detect problems that our management&#146;s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. </P>

long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to
comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this prospectus and our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions
from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although
circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June&nbsp;30 before that time or if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion
or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December&nbsp;31 or, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three year period before
that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a &#147;smaller reporting company&#148; which would allow us to take advantage of many of
the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in
this prospectus and our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result,
there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the JOBS Act, emerging

company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market and
other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and
increase demand on our systems and resources. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required,
improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management&#146;s attention may be diverted from other
business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. Further, there are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in
2010, that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as &#147;say on pay&#148; and proxy access. Recent legislation permits smaller &#147;emerging growth companies&#148; to implement many of these requirements
over a longer period and up to five years from the pricing of our initial public offering. We intend to take advantage of this new legislation but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or
planned and thereby incur unexpected expenses. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations,
which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for
public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a
result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to
disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management&#146;s time and
attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice,

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are an early-stage cancer diagnostics company that develops and commercializes proprietary circulating tumor cell, or CTC, and circulating
tumor DNA, or ctDNA, tests utilizing a standard blood sample. Our current CTC breast cancer test provides, and our planned future tests would provide, information to oncologists that enable them to select appropriate personalized treatment for their
patients based on better, timelier and more-detailed data on the characteristics of tumors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our current breast cancer test and our
planned future tests utilize our Cell Enrichment and Extraction (CEE) technology for the enumeration and analysis of CTCs, and our CEE-Selector technology for the detection and analysis of ctDNA, each performed on a standard blood sample. The CEE
technology is an internally developed, microfluidics-based CTC capture and analysis platform, with enabling features that change how CTC testing can be used by clinicians by providing real-time biomarker monitoring with only a standard blood sample.
The CEE-Selector technology enables mutation detection with enhanced sensitivity and specificity and is applicable to nucleic acid from CTCs or other samples types, such as blood plasma for ctDNA. We believe the CEE-Selector technology is an
important part of certain of our pipeline CTC tests and will be a stand-alone test for molecular analysis of biomarkers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At our corporate
headquarters facility located in San Diego, California, we operate a clinical laboratory that is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, and accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP. We
manufacture our CEE microfluidic channels, related equipment and certain reagents to perform our current breast cancer test and our planned future tests at this facility. CLIA certification and CAP accreditation are required before any clinical
laboratory, including ours, may perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of obtaining information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease or the assessment of health. The tests we offer and intend to offer are classified as
laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, under CLIA regulations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are in the process of commercializing our first test, OncoCEE-BR, for
breast cancer, and anticipate launching an OncoCEE-LU test for non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, in the third quarter of 2014. These tests utilize our CEE technology platform and provide CTC enumeration as well as biomarker analysis from a
standard blood sample. In the case of the OncoCEE-BR test, biomarker analysis involves fluorescence in situ hybridization, or FISH, for the detection and quantitation of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2, gene copy number. We
plan to include immunocytochemical analysis of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor proteins in the OncoCEE-BR test within the next year. The OncoCEE-LU test&#146;s biomarker analysis would include FISH for EML4/ALK and ROS1 gene fusions, as
well as mutation analysis for the epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, gene, the K-ras gene and the B-raf gene. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The L858R mutation

OncoCEE tests as their relevance is demonstrated in clinical trials, for example, ret proto-oncogene gene fusions in NSCLC, which may indicate a particular course of therapy, and NRAS for melanoma, which may predict therapy resistance. In addition,
we are developing a series of other CTC and ctDNA tests for different solid tumor types, including colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer and melanoma, each incorporating treatment-associated biomarker analyses specific to that cancer,
planned to be launched over the next two to three years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations and Financial Condition </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our overall long-term growth plan depends on our ability to develop and commercialize tests through our CLIA laboratory. We have the OncoCEE-BR
test available as a commercial product and we plan to enhance revenue for this product through the efforts of a sales and marketing organization we plan to hire. We are developing additional OncoCEE tests for non-small cell lung, colorectal, gastric
and prostate cancers and melanoma that we expect to make available to physicians over the next three years. To facilitate market adoption of our tests, we anticipate having to successfully complete additional clinical utility studies with clinical
samples to generate clinical utility data and then publish our results in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Our ability to complete such clinical studies is dependent upon our ability to leverage our collaborative relationships with leading
institutions to facilitate our research, to conduct the appropriate clinical studies and to obtain favorable clinical data. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe
that the factors discussed in the following paragraphs have had and are expected to continue to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Revenues </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Almost all of our
revenues in 2012 and 2013 were generated by our OncoCEE-BR test. Over 75% of annual revenue was generated through our arrangement with Clarient in 2012, and over 75% of annual revenue was generated through our relationship with Dana Farber in 2013.
The clinical laboratory industry is highly competitive, and our relationships and our partners&#146; relationships with decision-makers at hospitals, cancer centers or physician offices is a critical component of securing their business.
Consequently, our ability to establish and manage partnerships with groups that have sales and marketing capabilities in our target markets and attract and maintain productive sales personnel that have and can grow these relationships will largely
determine our ability to grow our clinical services revenue. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2012, $67,000, which represented the majority of our revenue for that
year, was billed to our commercial partner, Clarient, which until May 2013 had responsibility for billing the third-party payors. Because Clarient paid us a contracted amount per test performed regardless of their billing and collections, we do not
have data about the payor mix, reimbursement history and collectability experience for the tests performed under such arrangement. Clarient has paid us for all tests that we conducted under our arrangement in 2012. In the May 2013 revision of our
arrangements with Clarient, we undertook responsibility for billing the payors and for reporting the results of the tests to the ordering physicians, and the exclusivity of Clarient&#146;s marketing partner rights for OncoCEE-BR ended. The May 2013
revision of our arrangements with Clarient will, in general, have the effect of delaying the timing of revenue recognition (see the &#147;Revenue Recognition&#148; paragraph of Note 3 of the notes to our audited financial statements) and adding
uncertainty to the collectability of our accounts receivable. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that in the future the percentage of our revenue which is
generated through our arrangement with Clarient will diminish. Since May 2013, the number of tests performed under our agreement with Clarient has decreased significantly. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2013, approximately $104,000 was billed to our clinical partner, Dana Farber, which represented the majority of our revenue for that year.

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2013 we first directly billed payors for physician-ordered testing; until May 2013,
our commercialization partner Clarient was responsible for all billing associated with our tests. We do not have data for Clarient&#146;s billing and collection experience with respect to our test, because Clarient paid us a contracted amount per
test performed regardless of their billing and collections. From May to December 2013, we performed an average of 1-3 physician-ordered tests per month (in addition to 20-30 tests per month performed since January 2013 under our development
collaboration program with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). Billing for physician-ordered tests is now handled for us by a non-Clarient billing service provider. In November and December 2013 we invoiced, through this service provider, for 13
physician-ordered tests. Of these tests, 8 were billed to private third-party payors and 5 were billed to Medicare. We have not yet had any response or adjudication from the payors as to these bills, and accordingly we do not yet have any data as to
reimbursement history or collectability experience. In addition, we believe the sample size of 13 is too small to be the basis for any conclusion about our ongoing payor mix. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The transition period to the new billing service provider was lengthened due to our focus on other priorities, as we knew the amounts for the
small number of unbilled physician-ordered tests were immaterial. The transition of the billing function to our billing service provider was completed in December 2013. Our small backlog of unbilled tests has now been billed, and all future tests
will be billed in a timely manner. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Cost of Revenues </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our cost of revenues consists principally of personnel costs, laboratory and manufacturing supplies and overhead. We are pursuing various
strategies to reduce and control our cost of revenues, including automating aspects of our processes, developing more efficient technology and methods, attempting to negotiate improved terms with our suppliers and exploring relocating our operations

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Research and Development Expenses</I>. We incur research and development expenses principally in connection with our efforts to develop and
improve our tests. Our primary research and development expenses consist of direct personnel costs, laboratory equipment and consumables and overhead expenses. We anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in the near-term,
principally as a result of hiring additional personnel to develop and validate tests in our pipeline and to perform work associated with clinical utility studies and development collaborations. In addition, we expect that our costs related to
collaborations with research and academic institutions will increase. All research and development expenses are charged to operations in the periods in which they are incurred. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Sales and Marketing Expenses</I>. Our sales and marketing expenses consist principally of personnel and related overhead costs for our
sales team and their support personnel, travel and entertainment expenses, and other selling costs including sales collaterals and trade shows. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase significantly now that we have completed our
initial public offering as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel and launch new tests. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>General and Administrative
Expenses</I>. General and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel-related expenses, professional fees, such as legal, accounting and business consultants, occupancy costs, and other general expenses. We expect that our general and
administrative expenses will increase as we expand our business operations. When we begin billing a significant number of tests, bad debt is expected to become a greater expense. We further expect that general and administrative expenses will
increase significantly due to increased information technology, legal, insurance, accounting and financial reporting expenses associated with being a public company. </P>

collectability, we consider whether we have sufficient payment history to reliably estimate a payor&#146;s individual payment patterns. For new tests where there is limited evidence of payment history at the time the tests are completed, we

measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date. We estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model, or Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock unit awards is determined by the price of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant. The value of the portion of the award that is
ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods using the straight-line method. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from
those estimates. At December&nbsp;31, 2013, we had unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options and restricted stock units of approximately $861,000 and $135,000, respectively, which amounts are expected to be recognized over
the next 2.81 years and 1.56 years, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We account for stock-based compensation awards to non-employees in accordance with ASC

equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. All issuances of equity instruments issued to non-employees as consideration for goods or services received by us are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instruments
issued. These awards are recorded in expense and additional paid-in capital in stockholders&#146; equity over the applicable service periods based on the fair value of the options at the end of each period. </P>

total other income/(expense). We continued to adjust the carrying value of the warrants until the completion of our initial public offering on February&nbsp;10, 2014, at which time the exercise price was fixed and the fair value of those warrants
was reclassified to shareholders&#146; deficit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Results of Operations </B></P>

compared with $6.6 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012, a decrease of $3.5 million, or 53%.The decrease was primarily due to a $1.8&nbsp;million decrease in personnel expenses relating to a reduction in research and development
headcount from an average of 16 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 to an average of 9 for the same period in 2013, and a $1.1 million decrease in research and development expenses due to the allocation of lab expenses to cost of revenues
based on the number of samples processed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>General and Administrative Expenses</I>. General and administrative expenses were $2.5
million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, compared with $2.1 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012, an increase of $0.4 million, or 22%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $266,000 in legal fees, particularly fees
pertaining to our patent portfolio, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $358,000, partially offset by a $310,000 decrease in personnel-related expenses resulting from a reduction in general and administrative headcount from
an average of 8 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 to an average of 6 for the same period in 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Sales and Marketing

2012, with the $0.1 million decrease primarily related to lower average debt balances, partially offset by increased debt discount amortization as a result of entering into new financing arrangements with associated discounts during 2013. </P>

year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012, an increase of $0.3 million, or 72%. The increase is due to a larger decline in the price of the shares underlying warrants during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 as compared to the year ended

arrangement. The principal amount of and accrued interest on the notes automatically converted into an aggregate of 547,794 shares of our common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering, at a conversion price equal to the price per

$2,581,000 were converted into 42,245,834 shares of Series A preferred stock. The conversion included the issuance of 41,694,760 shares of Series A preferred stock to directors and their affiliates and other related parties. All of the converted

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2013, we amended a secured promissory note with a principal balance of $1.4 million, held by a trust affiliated with Claire K. T.
Reiss, a 5% shareholder and at the time a director, to provide that all principal of and accrued interest on the note would automatically convert into common stock upon the closing of an initial public offering, at the price per share at which
common stock is sold in such initial public offering. This amendment was not related to Mrs.&nbsp;Reiss&#146; later decision to resign from the board of directors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2013, we entered into a revolving line of credit with UBS Bank USA in the initial amount of $1.5 million. The maximum amount of this
line of credit has subsequently been increased to approximately $2.6&nbsp;million. Interest accrues daily on the outstanding balance and is paid monthly at a variable rate which is currently 2.75% over the 30 day LIBOR rate or a current effective
annual interest rate of 2.92%. UBS Bank USA has the right to terminate the revolving line of credit at any time, and if it does, all amounts drawn under the revolving line of credit would be immediately payable. An affiliate of our director David F.
Hale, and an affiliate of Claire K. T. Reiss, a 5% shareholder and at the time a director, an affiliate of our director Edward Neff, an affiliate of our director Bruce E. Gerhardt, and an affiliate of our director Ivor Royston guaranteed the loan
and pledged financial assets to UBS Bank USA to secure their guaranties. In return, we issued common stock warrants to the guarantors. The number of shares subject to the common stock warrants will be determined by dividing the warrant coverage
amount, which is 50% of the fair market value of the collateral provided by the respective guarantors to secure their respective guaranty obligations to UBS Bank USA, by the exercise price, which was set at the price per share of our common stock
sold in our initial public offering. The number of shares underlying the associated common stock warrants were fixed so that such warrants became exercisable at $10.00&nbsp;per share for an aggregate of 128,903 shares of common stock. We have
entered into an agreement with the guarantors that provides for us to reimburse them for any amounts paid by them on such guaranties. This reimbursement obligation is secured by a security interest in our assets. </P>

of our initial public offering on February&nbsp;10, 2014. A portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering were subsequently used to repay substantially all of our outstanding indebtedness. </P>

months is probable. Furthermore, we may need to raise additional capital to expand our business to meet our long-term business objectives. We expect that our operating expenses and capital expenditures will increase in the future as we expand our
business. We plan to increase our sales and marketing headcount to promote our current breast cancer test and our planned future cancer diagnostic tests and our research and development headcount to validate the tests currently in our pipeline.
These headcount increases are aimed to expand our pipeline and to perform work associated with our research collaborations. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenues to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we may need to
continue to raise additional capital to fund our operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may raise additional capital to fund our current operations and to fund

standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of <B>Biocept,

accrued interest of approximately $2,581,000 were converted into 42,245,834 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001. In conjunction with this conversion, $236,799 of derivative warrant liabilities were reclassified to additional
paid-in capital, as the underlying exercise prices on the warrants were determined by the debt conversion. In addition, during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, an additional $144,346 of derivative warrant liabilities were reclassified to
additional paid-in capital when their underlying exercise price was fixed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company issued to its

(&#147;IPO&#148;). The fair value of the warrant as calculated under the Company&#146;s probability weighted Black-Scholes valuation model was approximately $309,000 at issuance in September 2013 (see Note 7), and is recorded on the balance sheet as
a component of deferred rent and warrant liability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company incurred $538,318 in costs directly
associated with its anticipated IPO, which are reflected on the balance sheet as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets at December&nbsp;31, 2013. A liability of $328,221 for associated unpaid invoices is recorded as a component of
accounts payable at December&nbsp;31, 2013. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>1. The Company and Business Activities </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Biocept, Inc.
(&#147;the Company&#148;) was founded in California in May 1997 and is a commercial-stage cancer diagnostics company developing and commercializing proprietary circulating tumor cell (CTC) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) tests utilizing a standard
blood sample to improve the treatment that oncologists provide to their patients by providing better, more detailed information on the characteristics of their tumor. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company operates a clinical laboratory that is CLIA-certified (under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment of 1988) and CAP-accredited (by the
College of American Pathologists), and manufactures CEE microfluidic channels, related equipment and certain reagents to perform the Company&#146;s diagnostic tests in a facility located in San Diego, California. CLIA certification and accreditation
are required before any clinical laboratory may perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of obtaining information for the diagnosis, prevention, treatment of disease, or assessment of health. The tests the Company offers are classified as
laboratory developed tests (LDTs), under the CLIA regulations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2013, the Company effected a reincorporation to Delaware by merging itself with
and into Biocept, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which had been formed to be and was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company since July&nbsp;23, 2013. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>2. Liquidity </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013, the
Company had accumulated deficits of approximately $113,188,000 and $122,421,000, respectively. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013, the Company incurred net losses of approximately $12,260,000 and $9,233,000, respectively. In
addition, as of December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company had notes payable and amounts outstanding under a line of credit due within one year, gross of applicable debt discounts, totaling approximately $8,371,000. The Company borrowed a total of
$8,530,000, and $6,226,000 during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013, respectively, under note agreements with certain shareholders and a line of credit. While the Company is currently in the commercialization stage of operations, the
Company has not yet achieved profitability and anticipates that it will continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Historically, the
Company&#146;s principal sources of cash have included revenues from clinical laboratory testing through contracted partners, proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance of debt. The Company&#146;s
principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations, payments relating to purchases of property and equipment and repayments of borrowings. The Company expects that the principal uses of cash in the future will be for hiring of sales and
marketing personnel and increased sales and marketing activities, funding of research and development, capital expenditures, and general working capital requirements. The Company expects that, as revenues grow, sales and marketing and research and
development expenses will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate and, as a result, the Company will need to generate significant net revenues to achieve and sustain income from operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February&nbsp;10, 2014, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $16,673,000 as a result of the closing of its IPO, net of underwriting discounts
and additional costs incurred (see Note 18). Management believes that its cash resources should be sufficient to support currently forecasted operations through at least the next twelve months. However, the Company operates in a market that makes
its prospects difficult to evaluate, and the likelihood that the Company will need additional debt or equity financing in the future to execute on its current or future business strategies beyond the next twelve months is probable. Management also
believes that, if necessary, it can implement plans in the short term to conserve existing cash should additional financing activities be delayed. Capital outlays and operating expenditures may occur over the next twelve months as the Company
expands its infrastructure, commercialization, and research and development activities. </P>

accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain prior period amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect the Company&#146;s Balance Sheets, Results of Operations or Cash Flows for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Use of Estimates </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The preparation of financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, convertible debt, derivative liabilities, income taxes, and stock-based
compensation. The Company bases its estimates on various assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. </P>

balance sheet information as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 gives effect to (i)&nbsp;the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of the Company&#146;s Series A preferred stock into 1,652,851 shares of common stock, (ii)&nbsp;the conversion of
convertible promissory notes and accrued interest of approximately $6,886,000 (as of December&nbsp;31, 2013) into an aggregate of 688,610 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock in connection with the closing of the Company&#146;s IPO,
(iii)&nbsp;the write-off of $874,158 to interest expense for the unamortized debt discount on notes payable, (iv)&nbsp;the reclassification to line of credit of $315,243 for the unamortized debt discount previously classified against notes payable,
(v)&nbsp;the issuance of&nbsp;an estimated 73,151&nbsp;shares of common stock upon such IPO pursuant to the settlement of certain restricted stock units (which are currently expressed in shares of preferred stock) in accordance with their terms,
(vi)&nbsp;the termination of certain warrants upon the closing of the Company&#146;s IPO in accordance with their terms and (vii)&nbsp;the reclassification to shareholders&#146; deficit of the fair value of certain warrants the exercise price and/or
exercisability period length of which will be fixed upon the closing of the Company&#146;s IPO in accordance with their terms, assuming for all such items an IPO price of $10.00 per share. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The unaudited pro forma balance sheet information as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 assumes that the completion of the Company&#146;s IPO had occurred as of
December&nbsp;31, 2013, and excludes shares of common stock issued in the IPO and any related net proceeds. In October 2013 the Board of Directors approved an amendment of the Company&#146;s certificate of incorporation, to be filed in connection
with the Company&#146;s IPO, which would decrease the number of common shares authorized to 40,000,000 and decrease the number of preferred shares authorized to 5,000,000. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2011, the Company effected a 1:3 reverse stock split of the Company&#146;s common shares. In addition, in July 2013, in conjunction with its
reincorporation in the state of Delaware, the Company initiated par values for preferred and common shares equal to $0.0001. On November&nbsp;1, 2013, the Company effected a 1:14 reverse stock split for all common shares. All references to share and
per share amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes to the financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the 1:14 reverse stock split and the change in par value. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Revenue Recognition </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Revenue is recognized in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) 605,
<I>Revenue Recognition</I>, and ASC 954-605 <I>Health Care Entities, Revenue Recognition </I>which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1)&nbsp;persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;
(2)&nbsp;delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the client or services have been rendered; (3)&nbsp;the price is fixed or determinable; and (4)&nbsp;collectability is reasonably
assured.&nbsp;For contract partners, revenue is recorded based upon the contractually agreed upon fee schedule. When assessing collectability, the Company considers whether there is sufficient payment history to reliably estimate a payor&#146;s
individual payment patterns. For new tests where there is limited evidence of payment history at the time the tests are completed, the Company recognizes revenue equal to the amount of cash received until such time as reimbursement experience can be
established. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s main source of revenue for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013 is through contracted partners. This revenue
is derived from clinical laboratory testing performed in the Company&#146;s laboratories under agreements with such partners. As there is a contractually agreed upon price, and collectability from the partners is reasonably assured, revenues for
these tests are earned at the time the test is completed and the results are delivered to the partners or a third party. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Cash and Cash Equivalents
</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company places its
cash and cash equivalents with reputable financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). At times, deposits held may exceed the amount of insurance provided by the FDIC. The Company has not experienced
any losses in its cash and cash equivalents and believes they are not exposed to any significant credit risk. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Fair Value Measurement </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in the Company&#146;s fair value measurements.&nbsp;These tiers include: Level
1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as
unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.&nbsp;The Company believes the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
expenses approximate their estimated fair values due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013,
the Company classified the fair value measurements of the Company&#146;s warrant liability derivative as Level 3. See Note 7 for further details about the inputs and assumptions used to determine the fair value of the warrant liability at each
balance sheet date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The values attributed to such warrants as of December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013 were as follows: </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments. The Company has
not experienced losses in such accounts. Management believes that the Company is not exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to its cash and cash equivalents. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2012, the Company launched commercial operations in partnership with a commercial partner, Clarient Diagnostic Services, Inc. (&#147;Clarient&#148;), a GE
Healthcare Company. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013, 79% and 10%, respectively, of the revenue earned was billed through this relationship. In addition, at December&nbsp;31, 2012, 100% of the receivables were due from Clarient.
In 2013, the Company entered into a research support agreement with a not-for-profit tax-exempt organization, Dana Farber Partners Cancer Care, Inc. (&#147;Dana Farber&#148;). For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, 77% of the revenue earned was
billed through this relationship. In addition, 100% of the receivables were due from Dana Farber at December&nbsp;31, 2013. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, three customers made up 78%, 11% and 10% of total revenues. </P>

original invoice amounts, less an estimate for doubtful receivables, based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a periodic basis. The estimate for doubtful receivables is determined from an analysis of the accounts receivable on a quarterly
basis, and is recorded as bad debt expense. As the Company only recognizes revenue to the extent collection is expected and reasonably assured, bad debt expense related to receivables from patient service revenue is recorded in general and
administrative expense in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received. As of December&nbsp;31,
2012 and 2013, management determined that all of the amounts recorded as accounts receivable were collectible, and no allowance for doubtful accounts was needed. </P>

the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value. At the point of loss recognition, a new cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in
facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Fixed Assets </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fixed assets consist of machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, computer equipment and software, leasehold improvements, capital leased equipment and
construction in process. Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Additions, improvements, and major renewals are capitalized. Maintenance, repairs, and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is
determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter. Depreciation expense
for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013 was approximately $366,000 and $267,000, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon sale, retirement or disposal of fixed
assets, the accounts are relieved of the cost and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization with any gain or loss recorded to the statement of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. These
computations utilize judgments and assumptions inherent in the estimates of future cash flows to determine recoverability of these assets. If the assumptions about these assets were to change as a result of events or circumstances, the Company may
be required to record an impairment loss. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Warrant Liability </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Warrants for shares that are contingently redeemable and for which the exercise price is not fixed are classified as liabilities on the accompanying balance
sheets and carried at their estimated fair value, determined through use of a Black-Scholes valuation model. As of and for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013, the Company evaluated and concluded that the fair value obtained from the
Black-Scholes method of valuing the warrant liability does not materially differ from the valuation of such warrants using the Monte Carlo or binomial lattice simulation models, and therefore the use of the Black-Scholes valuation model was
considered a reasonable method to value the warrants. At the end of each reporting period, any changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other income (expense). The Company will continue to adjust the carrying value of the warrants until
the completion of its IPO on February&nbsp;10, 2014, at which time the exercise price was fixed and the fair value of those warrants was reclassified to shareholders&#146; deficit. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Stock-based Compensation </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company accounts for
stock-based compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, <I>Compensation&#151;Stock Compensation</I>, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors based
on estimated fair values on the grant date. The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model (&#147;Black-Scholes valuation model&#148;). The value of the portion of the
award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods using the straight-line method. The Company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and revises these estimates in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates. See additional information in Note 10. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards to non-employees
in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 505-50, <I>Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees</I> (&#147;ASC 505-50&#148;). Under ASC 505-50, the Company determines the fair value of the warrants or stock-based compensation awards granted as either the fair
value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. All issuances of equity instruments issued to non-employees as consideration for goods or services

received by the Company are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. These awards are recorded in expense and additional paid-in capital in shareholders&#146;
equity over the applicable service periods based on the fair value of the options at the end of each period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Calculating the fair value of stock-based
awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions into the Black-Scholes valuation model. Stock-based compensation expense is calculated using the Company&#146;s best estimates, which involves inherent uncertainties, and the application of
management&#146;s judgment. Significant estimates include the fair value of the Company&#146;s common stock at the date of grant, the expected life of the stock option, stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate and forfeiture rates. </P>

are expensed as incurred. The amounts expensed in the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013 were approximately $6,562,000 and $3,087,000, respectively, which includes salaries of research and development personnel. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Income Taxes </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company provides for income taxes
utilizing the liability method. Under the liability method, current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or refundable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is computed for the
expected future impact of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax credits. Tax rate changes are reflected in the computation of the income tax
provision during the period such changes are enacted. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in management&#146;s opinion, it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment. The Company&#146;s valuation allowance is based on available evidence, including its current year operating loss, evaluation of positive and negative evidence with respect to certain specific deferred tax assets including evaluation
sources of future taxable income to support the realization of the deferred tax assets. The Company has established a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013, and therefore has not recognized any
income tax benefit or expense in the periods presented. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ASC 740, <I>Income Taxes</I> (&#147;ASC 740&#148;), clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
income taxes recognized in the financial statements. ASC 740 provides that a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions may be recognized when it is more-likely-than- not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of
any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. ASC 740 also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties
related to income tax matters in income tax expense. There is no accrual for interest or penalties for income taxes on the balance sheets at December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013, and the Company has not recognized interest and/or penalties in the
statements of operations for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Recent Accounting Pronouncements </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires netting unrecognized tax benefits against deferred tax assets for a loss or other
carryforward that would apply in settlement of uncertain tax positions. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2013. The Company does not believe that adoption of this guidance will have a
material impact on the Company&#146;s financial statements or disclosures. </P>

a revolving line of credit with UBS Bank USA in the initial amount of $1.5 million. Interest accrues daily on the outstanding balance and is paid monthly at a variable rate which, as of December&nbsp;31, 2013, was 2.75% over the 30 day LIBOR rate or
a nominal annual interest rate of 2.92%. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, the amount outstanding under this revolving line of credit is approximately $2.0 million. Three of the Company&#146;s related parties guaranteed the loan and pledged financial
assets to the bank to secure their guaranties, as approved by the Company&#146;s board of directors. In return, the Company issued common stock warrants to the guarantors. The number of shares subject to the common stock warrants will be determined
by dividing the warrant coverage amount, which is 50% of the fair market value of the collateral provided by the respective guarantors to secure their respective guaranty obligations to the bank, by the exercise price, which will be set at the price
per share of the Company&#146;s common stock sold in its IPO. See Note 7 for further discussion of the warrant liabilities. The Company has entered into an agreement with the guarantors that provides for reimbursement of any amounts paid by them on
their guaranties. This reimbursement obligation is secured by a security interest in the Company&#146;s assets. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During January 2009, the Company entered into an amendment and restatement of the unsecured amended loan, whereby
the parties agreed that the principal amount would be reduced to $3,000,000. The amended and restated unsecured note bears interest at a variable rate per annum based on prime plus 25 basis points. 25% of the accrued interest was due and payable
quarterly in arrears on the last business day of each three-month quarter beginning February&nbsp;1, 2009. The remaining 75% of the accrued interest was not to be compounded by becoming part of the principal, and was due and payable in a lump-sum
payment on the maturity date. The principal and any interest amounts that remain outstanding was set to mature at the earlier of (a)&nbsp;April&nbsp;20, 2010, or (b)&nbsp;the date immediately prior to the Company&#146;s closing of an acquisition or
asset transfer as defined by the Company&#146;s amended and restated articles of incorporation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In conjunction with the 2009 amendment, the Company
issued a warrant to purchase preferred shares issued in the first equity financing to occur subsequent to the execution of the note, and in which the Company receives at least $2,000,000 in gross aggregate proceeds. The exercise price of the warrant
is equal to the per share price of preferred shares sold in that equity financing, and the number of shares that may be exercised is equal to 10% of the principal amount of the convertible loan divided by the exercise price. Early termination of the
warrant can occur upon an IPO, or if the Company is acquired. The holder of the warrant is to be given 20 days advance notice of such an event, and the warrant will terminate if not exercised before the date of the event. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A qualifying equity financing occurred during February 2009, which set the warrant exercise price at $0.60 per share. </P>

payments to be made to the lender and to secure the Company&#146;s obligations under the note. The secured amended and restated note bears interest at a per annum fixed rate of 3.25% and is due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last business

are due and payable quarterly in advance. For principal payments due and payable during the period of May&nbsp;1, 2010 through January&nbsp;31, 2011, the quarterly principal payment was equal to $45,000; for principal payments due and payable during
the period of February&nbsp;1, 2012 through January&nbsp;31, 2014, the quarterly principal payment is equal to $90,000; and for principal payments due and payable during the period of February&nbsp;1, 2014 through the maturity date, the quarterly
principal payment is equal to $150,000. In addition to the $750,000 principal paid on the effective date of the amendment, the Company paid principal payments of $135,000 and $180,000 during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2011,

Note agreed to convert the total principal balance owed under the Goodman Note of $1,935,000 and accrued interest of approximately $105,000 into 3,777,324 preferred shares at a conversion price of $0.54 per share. Although the conversion price of
the debt was greater than the value of the preferred shares at the time of conversion, the Company did not record a gain on the conversion under the troubled debt restructuring accounting guidance since the transaction occurred between related
parties, and thus, was treated as a capital transaction. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2013, in connection with this conversion, the Company issued to such beneficial owner a
warrant to purchase 23,809 shares of common stock at an exercise price which will be set at the price per share of the Company&#146;s common stock sold in the Company&#146;s IPO. The warrants will be exercisable for a two-year period beginning with
the closing of the Company&#146;s IPO. In accordance with guidance applicable to accounting for derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the warrants are initially recorded at their fair value and are then re-valued at
each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For the warrants for common shares issued under the Goodman Note agreement, the Company used a probability weighted Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2008, the Company issued a convertible note in the principal amount of $1,400,000 which is secured by all assets of the Company to an affiliate of
a major shareholder. The 2008 Convertible Note bears interest at a variable rate based on prime per annum payable at maturity, and matures at the earliest occurrence of, (a)&nbsp;the passing of 48 months from inception of the note, (b)&nbsp;the
closing date of an acquisition or asset transfer as defined by the note, or (c)&nbsp;the closing date of the issuance and sale of shares of common stock of the Company in the Company&#146;s IPO. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon the closing of a sale by the Company of its preferred shares in which the Company receives an aggregate of at least $20,000,000 in cumulative gross
proceeds, including conversion of the convertible loan amount before the maturity date, the unpaid principal and accrued interest shall automatically be converted into the number of preferred shares, of the series sold by the Company in such sale,
equal to the unpaid principal and accrued interest divided by the per share purchase price of the preferred shares in such sale. The 2008 Convertible Note may also be converted before the maturity date at the option of the holder at the closing of
an equity financing involving the sale of the Company&#146;s preferred shares in which the Company receives an aggregate of at least $2,000,000 in cumulative gross proceeds, with a conversion price equal to the per share price included in that
equity financing. In July&nbsp;2013, the Company amended the 2008 Convertible Note to provide that all principal and accrued interest on the note would automatically convert into common stock upon the closing of an IPO at the price per share at
which common stock is sold in such IPO. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Issued with the 2008 Convertible Note was a warrant to purchase preferred shares issued in the first equity
financing to occur subsequent to the execution of the 2008 Convertible Note, and in which the Company receives at least $2,000,000 in gross aggregate proceeds. The exercise price of the warrant is equal to the per share price of preferred shares
sold in that equity financing, and the number of shares that may be exercised is equal to 10% of the principal amount of the convertible loan divided by the exercise price. Early termination of the warrant can occur upon an IPO or if the Company is
acquired. The holder of the warrant is to be given 20 days advance notice of such an event, and the warrant will terminate if not exercised before the date of the event. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A qualifying equity financing occurred during February 2009, which set the 2008 Convertible Note conversion price and the warrant exercise price at $0.60 per

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2011, the Company executed a note and warrant purchase agreement with a major shareholder&#146;s affiliates. In exchange for a series of loans in
an aggregate amount equal to $5,000,000 over a period through September&nbsp;1, 2011, the Company issued secured convertible promissory notes and warrants to purchase preferred shares. The aggregate amount was subsequently raised to $6,000,000 and
then $15,000,000 during the year and the funding period was first extended to February 2012 and then to December 2012. Other investors, including related parties, also became party to this arrangement and purchased 2011 Convertible Bridge Notes and
warrants. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All unpaid principal and interest outstanding was initially payable on December&nbsp;31, 2011. During 2012, the maturity date was extended to
December&nbsp;31, 2012. The 2011 Convertible Bridge Notes are secured by virtually all of the assets of the Company. The 2011 Convertible Bridge Notes bear interest at 8%, payable at maturity. The number of preferred shares for which the warrants
are exercisable is determined by dividing the warrant coverage amount, which is 20% of the principal amount of the notes issued under the agreement, by the exercise price. </P>

and accrued interest of approximately $1,832,000 into 26,237,611 preferred shares at a conversion price of $0.54 per share. Upon the conversion, the exercise price of the related warrants was set at $0.54 per share, and the $236,799 fair value of
the warrants was reclassified into additional paid-in capital as of June&nbsp;28, 2013. Although the conversion price of the debt was greater than the value of the preferred shares at the time of conversion, the Company did not record a gain on the

of between $3.08 and $14.28 per share, contractual term of 5 years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.38%, a dividend yield of 0%, and volatility of 105.0%. The value of the warrant using the probability weighted Black-Scholes valuation model accounted
for a probability of 75%, while a fair value of $0 was weighted 25%. The fair value of the warrant is recorded as a liability of approximately $282,000 at December&nbsp;31, 2013. </P>

stock and the volatilities of similar companies over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock options. The volatilities of similar companies are used in conjunction with the Company&#146;s historical volatility because of the lack of
sufficient relevant history for the Company&#146;s common stock equal to the expected term. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. The expected term
assumption is estimated based primarily on the options&#146; vesting terms and remaining contractual life and employees&#146; expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon
observed interest rates on the grant date appropriate for the term of the employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the expectation of no future dividend payouts by the Company. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013, the Company has evaluated the various tax positions
reflected in their income tax returns for both federal and state jurisdictions, and all open tax years in these jurisdictions, to determine if the Company has any uncertain tax positions on the historical tax returns. The Company recognizes the
impact of an uncertain tax position on an income tax return at the largest amount that the relevant taxing authority is more-likely-than not to sustain upon audit.&nbsp;The Company does not recognize uncertain income tax positions if they have less
than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained. Based on this assessment, the Company believes there are no tax positions for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits should be recorded as of December&nbsp;31, 2012 or 2013. The Company is
subject to taxation in the United States and California. The Company&#146;s federal filings prior to 2010 and the Company&#146;s California filings prior to 2009 are no longer subject to examination. The Company&#146;s policy is to recognize
interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, future changes in unrecognized tax benefits will not impact the Company&#146;s effective tax rate. The Company is currently
not under examination by any taxing authorities and does not believe its unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months. </P>

December&nbsp;31, 2013 was approximately $2,000, which are unpaid and recorded in accounts payable at December&nbsp;31, 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company believes that
these transactions were on terms at least as favorable to the Company as could have been obtained from unrelated third parties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>16. Commitments and

leases office, laboratory, and warehouse space at its San Diego, California facility under a non-cancelable operating lease. The initial lease was for an eight-year term expiring in 2012. In November 2011, the Company extended the lease term through
October&nbsp;31, 2018 and expanded the original premises by 9,849 square feet. Under the amended lease, the landlord delivered the expanded premises in May 2013. The Company records rent expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease
and records the excess of expense over the amounts paid as deferred rent. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 and 2013, rent expense was
approximately $937,000 and $1,143,000, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2012 the Company owed rent in arrears of approximately $185,000. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company owed no rent in arrears. This amount is included in accounts
payable on the balance sheet. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In September 2013, the Company amended its non-cancellable operating lease for its office, laboratory, and warehouse space
at its San Diego, California facility. The amendment extends the maturity date of the lease through July&nbsp;31, 2020. As part of this amendment, the landlord waived the lease payments due from August&nbsp;1, 2013 through December&nbsp;31, 2013 of
approximately $503,000, and the Company forfeited its long-term deposit of approximately $269,000. In conjunction with this amendment, the Company granted to the landlord a warrant to purchase common shares with a warrant coverage amount of $502,605
and an exercise price equal to the price per share of the Company&#146;s common stock sold in the Company&#146;s IPO (see Note 7). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The future minimum

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and
current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation,
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December&nbsp;31, 2013. </P>
